 {"body":"Hello Richard.\nThis is my first time contacting my MSP, or any member of parliament, so forgive me if the content of this email is irrelevant to you. However, my issue is purely political, and so perhaps I am not to astray. \nMy name is Paul Meredith, I am 24 years old, and spent my whole life, bar tertiary education, in Moray. I am currently registered to vote at 11 King Street, Lossiemouth. After I left education, I lived at that address with my mother and sister for three or so years. I spent the last two and a half of those years working full time at Walker's Shortbread.\nI met my now wife, four years ago. We became engaged on the 11th of September 2014, and we married, in Cairo, on the 8th of August 2015. In Islamic culture, they still have dowries for marriage, and I had to save up around 10,000GBP for the marriage. Just before, and just after the marriage, my wife applied for a visit visa to visit my family. These were rejected. I read the rejections, and quite frankly, it seemed as if it did not matter how much evidence is provided, they will catch you out, and they will doubt your intentions. I was disgusted at how they responded. \nWe knew there was no way for her to live in Scotland. I was on an income of around 12,000GBP a year, and the only savings I had were going towards the marriage and visiting her. So getting a spouse visa was out of the questions. For that, and I do not remember off the top of my head, my income had to be much much higher, or I had to have an insane amount of savings. \nNow, I do not consider my family poor, they get mostly everything they want, but no member of my family, has ever met the financial requirements for a spouse visa. Maybe it is the area we live, or maybe you just have to buy the right to have your spouse immigrate. \nOkay, so there is another route for her. I could live and work in another EEA state for a while and I would obtain the right for her to join me under the European Directive 2004/38/EC. This seems insane. The fact that I have to use European law to gain rights in my own country.\nA few months after the second rejection, in March 2016, I decided to move out to Egypt and live together there while we decide what to do next. After a few months of not adjusting to the culture or language here, we decided my wife should apply for an Irish visit visa and register with immigration there. Now, this is possible, and it should be accepted, since I will be exercising freedom of movement at the time of arrival. I have made our intention to immigrate there explicit in my declaration in her application. We provided all the documents and translations necessary. These types of applications are meant to be dealt with in an \"accelerated manor\". The next appointment at the Irish embassy was five weeks away, and it was submitted on the 11th of July 2016. \nNow, it may just be me, but having all the *Irish* visa applications in the middle east and north Africa shipped off to a visa processing centre in the UAE, that seems a little off. But this is irrelevant. It has been just over 15 weeks since that application process was started. And they are currently processing applications received mid May, so we have at least another six weeks to wait. Even though I have read the whole guideline pdf for the visa processing officers, given my past experience with the UK visas, I still worry they are going to point out a grammar error, manipulate it into an inconsistency, and reject her application.\n---\nSo this is our situation.

 {"body":"Hello Richard.\n\nThis is my first time contacting my MSP, or any member of parliament, so forgive me if the content of this email is irrelevant to you. However, my issue is purely political, and so perhaps I am not to astray. \n\nMy name is Paul Meredith, I am 24 years old, and spent my whole life, bar tertiary education, in Moray. I am currently registered to vote at 11 King Street, Lossiemouth. After I left education, I lived at that address with my mother and sister for three or so years. I spent the last two and a half of those years working full time at Walker's Shortbread.\n\nI met my now wife, four years ago. We became engaged on the 11th of September 2014, and we married, in Cairo, on the 8th of August 2015. In Islamic culture, they still have dowries for marriage, and I had to save up around 10,000GBP for the marriage. Just before, and just after the marriage, my wife applied for a visit visa to visit my family. These were rejected. I read the rejections, and quite frankly, it seemed as if it did not matter how much evidence is provided, they will catch you out, and they will doubt your intentions. I was disgusted at how they responded. \n\nWe knew there was no way for her to live in Scotland. I was on an income of around 12,000GBP a year, and the only savings I had were going towards the marriage and visiting her. So getting a spouse visa was out of the questions. For that, and I do not remember off the top of my head, my income had to be much much higher, or I had to have an insane amount of savings. \n\nNow, I do not consider my family poor, they get mostly everything they want, but in my extended family, I think my mother is the only person to meet the financial requirements for a spouse visa. Maybe it is the area we live, or maybe you just have to buy the right to have your spouse immigrate. \n\nOkay, so there is another route for her. I could live and work in another EEA state for a while and I would obtain the right for her to join me under the European Directive 2004/38/EC. This seems insane. The fact that I have to use European law to gain rights in my own country. The fact that I have the right to live and work with my spouse in every other EEA state other than my own, it is crazy.\n\nA few months after the second rejection, in March 2016, I decided to move out to Egypt and live together there while we decide what to do next. After a few months of not adjusting to the culture or language here, we decided my wife should apply for an Irish visit visa and register with immigration there. Now, this is possible, and it should be accepted, since I will be exercising freedom of movement at the time of arrival. I have made our intention to immigrate there explicit in my declaration in her application. We provided all the documents and translations necessary. These types of applications are meant to be dealt with in an \"accelerated manor\". The next appointment at the Irish embassy was five weeks away, and it was submitted on the 11th of July 2016. \n\nNow, it may just be me, but having all the *Irish* visa applications in the middle east and north Africa shipped off to a visa processing centre in the UAE, that seems a little off. But this is irrelevant. It has been just over 15 weeks since that application process was started. And they are currently processing applications received mid May, so we have at least another six weeks to wait. Even though I have read the whole guideline PDF for the visa processing officers, given my past experience with the UK visas, I still worry they are going to point out a grammar error, manipulate it into an inconsistency, and reject her application.\n\n---\n\nSo this is our situation. If I want to be with my wife, I am stuck here in Cairo. Even if she gets a visa to Ireland, now I have to live in Ireland. A place I have no friends, no family, no job.\n\nI struggle to see how my income of 12,000GBP could not support a spouse; I saved up around 9,000GBP discretionary income in a year for the marriage. I may not be rich, but my outgoings were not high either. And none of that would matter if she had the right to work in Scotland too. A combined income of 24,000GBP is by far enough to live happily.\n\nI want to live in my home country. I miss my job, I miss my family, friends and colleges.

I moved to Egypt at the beginning of this year because of the legal barriers\npreventing my wife live with me in the UK.I am now trying to immigrate to Ireland\nwith my wife under the Directive 2004/38/EC. After waiting an entire month for the\nnearest appointment at the Irish embassy in Cairo, my wife submitted her application\non July the 22nd, 2016, along with her original passport, and required photocopies\nof other documents. My wife followed the procedure laid out on the Irish Immigration\nwebsite:\nhttp://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Family%20Members%20of%20EU_EEA%20_Swiss%20citizensAs\nstated on that page:&quot;Applications from &lsquo;qualifying family members&rsquo;\n(see para. 3 above for list of &lsquo;qualifying family members&rsquo;) are\nprocessed on an accelerated basis.  While every effort is made to process these\napplications within a reasonable time frame, processing times will vary, having\nregard to the volume of applications, their complexity and the resources available.\nApplications from &lsquo;permitted family members&rsquo; are not subject to the\naccelerated process. Processing times can vary throughout the year, due to the high\nvolume of applications, their complexity and the resources available. While every\neffort is made to process them within a reasonable time frame, the processing times\ncan increase when the provision of additional documentation is requested or a\ndetailed assessment is required.&quot;And in the Directive 2004/38/EC:&quot;Member\nStates shall grant such persons every facility to obtain the necessary visas. Such\nvisas shall be issued free of charge as soon as possible and on the basis of an\naccelerated procedure.&quot;The embassy told her that the application will be sent\nto a processing office in Abu Dhabi, UAE.The Irish Immigration website FAQ gives\ncurrent processing times for the Irish office here\n(http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Current_Processing_Times), and states,\n&quot;If your application was sent to an overseas office of the Irish Naturalisation\nand Immigration Service, contact that office for processing information.&quot;This\nsends you to this page: http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/Contact%20UsWhich does\nnot include Egypt, but gives the link to the Abu Dhabi office, where you can find\nwritten\n(https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/uae/our-services/visas/visas-for-ireland/),\n&quot;Status Enquiries Please do not contact this office to enquire about the status\nof your application as this is available on-line once the decision has been made. A\nreport detailing all decisions for the previous week is posted each Monday to this\nsite. Once a decision is made on an application it is communicated to you\n&lsquo;without delay&rsquo; by the Visa Office, Consulate or Embassy where you\nlodged your application.&quot;The page they refer to is this one:\nhttps://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/uae/our-services/visas/weekly-decision-reports/They\nsay they publish every Thursday with the previous week's decisions. But as you can\nsee in the previous quote, they say Monday. And if you watch this page, it is posted\non any day, with often weeks between posts.Now, we have been waiting three months\nfor a decision, or any form of contact. We have been told explicitly not to contact\nthem in regard to this. We have no confirmation of where her passport is, or even if\nthe application has been received. The Directive 2004/38/EC states that the visa\nmust be issued as soon as possible and with an accelerated procedure. Now I am\nwondering what exactly as soon as possible and accelerated procedure mean, if not\nnothing. a) How, and, can she get her passport back without withdrawing the\napplication.b) What does as soon as possible and accelerated procedure mean?c) Is\nthe processing office in Abu Dhabi processing this type of visa with the priority\nthat it must?

 {"body":"Good morning Mr Meredith\nI am responding to the case posted to SOLVIT, referring to the delay of the Irish\nAuthority to complete an EU entry visa applications.\nI am informed that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and its\nembassies are making every effort to process EU free movement applications on an\naccelerated basis.  However, processing times can vary and due to an extreme volume\nof applications, there is a backlog which they are working hard to address.  All\napplications are being processed in turn, and SOLVIT is not able to ask that any\nspecific EU application is prioritised over other EU applications.  All applications\nwill be processed in turn and to a conclusion in due course.\nAs INIS has referred to an increased workload, that all EU applications are being\nhandled in turn, and due to the fact that we cannot offer any additional assistance\nin this case because no EU application will be prioritised over any other EU\napplication, we have now closed the complaint on SOLVIT.\nWe do of course hope that it will not be too much longer in view of your concerns.\nRegards","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"We tried to feed it and comfort it.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Are you asleep.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Spoken like a true 2ker.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I do want a high high refresh rate monitor for fast games.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But for everything else, well, it is 30fps video and mostly static text.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And for the fast monitor, unless an new tech comes along ips is just too slow, so I would just go tn.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"240hz tn 1080p monitor for stepmania basically.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But first, a iris 580.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why does it say 15.73, and then 3.57?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"On 3G though?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No point in 16Mbps if you can not download at that speed for more than a few hours.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Your upload is twice our download.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why are you awake.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"8 what?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"In scotland we had 90Mb/s.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And we lived in a small town.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Ben lives in the capital and gets 240Mb/s.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The problem with the internet is not so much speed.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Imagine a road from here to alexandria.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And we want 4000 trucks from alexandria to cairo.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Let us imagine we have 4000trucks/s internet.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"This means the road is very very wide and all the trucks can fit on the road at once.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The problem with the internet is that no one has real directions.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So I need to send someone out who has no idea where alexandria is, but just has an address.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They reach a petrol station and they ask if they know any other petrol stations nearer.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And this happens about 25 times.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then they arrive in alexandria.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And now they tell the 4000 trucks to come back to cairo, but they have to find the directions again.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And then there is the problem with congestion.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Because the roads are share.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And sometimes trucks go missing.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And when you put too many trucks on a road, more go missing.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So congestion control exists.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It stopped the roads from getting jammed.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But it also slows down everything.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So instead of sending 4000 trucks, it sends 8.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And when the 8 get all the way back to Cairo, I send a guy out to tell alexandria that I got all 8.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then they will send another 32, and when I confirm I got all those, they send more.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If some trucks go missing, they will resend those trucks, but also not send as many trucks next time.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Just one problem with the internet.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I would find this person taking photos very creepy.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"HEEEEEEEEY","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Maybe she had chilli on her fingers.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"When do you get up for university?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But you said you had a class when I asked.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is not a public holiday if the public do not take a holiday.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am just brushing my teeth.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am now.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Wake up.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I need tea.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"For gaming.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But all the games I play it could handle 1080p.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Since my current GPU does a fine job, any improvement is a bonus.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I imagine the 580 can play most games at low at 1080.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Maybe I could finally play Skyrim.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My CPU does struggle with games too.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My computer is so out of date now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do not worry, soon I will have an iris 680 to fantasize about.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Cheaper than a 100gbp discrete.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And better drivers.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, I was thinking passive next.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"For linux.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, they are.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But they beat the open source alternatives for amd and nvidia.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No way I am getting a skylake with it's built in rootkit though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not really, more demand for windows drivers.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I may be wrong, I just saw three or four game benchmarks.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Could just be those games.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have not used the intel drivers for 2d in a while now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They have around 25% better performance.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But it is nothing I notice.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And they have the DP bug that makes using 60fps 4k unusable.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think most development is going towards gallium and modesetting.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I can not find which package owns it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And I need it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have no no idea why anything is closed source.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The only reason I can think is because their code is shit and they want to hide it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or they have something bad in it they want to hide.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I mean, even just open source.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They could make it non-free and not allow anyone to compile and modify.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I guess it has something to do with money.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Anyone who can take the decision to open source stuff in these companies, just have no idea what code is.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or not going to gain money.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What are you doing?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No, never cancelled anything.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you double sure?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They will probably charge you double next month.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Not aware of any bugs.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Had to use background threads reading the fifo pipes, which in go is wonderful.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://gitlab.com/meutraa/mm","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Should be fully functional now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I departed from how ii treats output with a single out file, because the nature of matrix is syncing history, which makes sense when every message is a file.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So ii tools to use it will not work.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will probably either write some shell scripts to interact with it, or another program.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I think I might have tried it once, 50% mashed potato, 50% flour, fried it up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you sure they did not take it? They might just give you ebills. You know that the money has not come out of your account?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I might see if I can find the account details and log in online to see the bills. But not right now.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"This never works for me, always says there is a technical glitch, always has.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not sure, the problem is they lock you out for a while if you get it wrong three times.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You might have to phone them. If the email address is paul@eternal.coffee, that does not exist anymore. Maybe just get it changed to cmeredith71@gmail.com and ihavearedcarpet\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I remember one time they tried to change my email but when I logged in, they fucked it up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do not mention the bills though haha. \n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Because you forgot your account login details and want to change them. That is reason enough to phone.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Some things are, but they also let you resign a contract, so you clearly have power too.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"As long as you have a bill number and account number, that will probably be enough.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You have paper bills from ages ago, right? You can just say you have been on paperless bills for ages and no longer have access to the bills because you do not have the account details.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Also, I never signed anything on paper, just verbally, which I guess is why they let you \"sign\" the other contract. I wonder how that contract stands up in court since they do not send you a copy of what you are \"signing\".\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Got any tips on making tattie scones? I might try tomorrow.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Maybe when you see the ebills, there might have been a reason you got credit with them so they are using up the credit first.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You might have overpaid over the months, some clause, or legal decision could also refund you credit.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Grate, not mash?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Think I will do cook and mash first, seems more reliable.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nah, the bills will tell you what are going on. No need to bring it up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not sure about flavouring. I want the good old tattie scones from tesco.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Bit of a trek though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you alive?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Ready?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well, after checking every day for results, it got less and less hopeful.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So I sent a complaint to the European Commission.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They agreed that Ireland were breaching EU law by delaying the process.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They directed us towards a law section specifying exactly how long they are allowed.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Two weeks, or four if they contact the Irish authorities.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Still no result.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Toka got a new job helping students apply for universities in the UK.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am going to the south of Egypt to work a week for the owner.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They need some English speaker to be the front of some new English centre they are opening.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh, sorry.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I really have no idea.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It could happen any thursday.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Of course Egypt will let her leave.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"There is no restriction on that...","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And there has only been failed national visa attempts, for visits.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"To the UK.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"With the such long delay, I can not but help it be on the back of my mind now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But if it does come through, it could be a bit disrupting.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"We would have three months to decide to leave.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not unless we live in another EU country for six months and the UK is still in the EU.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well yeah, but if the UK has left, we will have no chance of living in Scotland.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If the Irish visa comes through and we can work there for six months, and the only thing I would worry about then is the UK illegally delaying her application so that the law changes and they can reject it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or we learn dutch and live in the Netherlands under a shengen visa.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, the thought of moving to the EU is risky and uncertain.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But also a door that could shut.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have talked to Toka. I have heard your advice. But, respectably, I would like you to live six months here before you advise living here longer. I understand your point for basic securities, but you are not aware of the problems living here. ","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Look dad.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I understand your concern.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But you are jumping to so many conclusions.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"First of all, to think that toka and I are not reading each others messages to each other.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The UK is changing, but to call it the worst it has been, this is an insult.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Have you ever read labour history of the UK? Or anything about the development of capitalism in the UK?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It might very well be the worst during your life, and this I have no doubt.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You growing up when labour unions started taking power of the country.","msgtype":"m.text"},

I have been so busy with work and trying to juggle life here. I apologise for not being in touch but I work from 5am to 8pm and when I get home im shattered. Ikeep meaning to log into this thing but because it doesnt always work its difficult to keep in touch. Whats happening with yours and Toqas Visa?\n\nPaul\nWell, after checking every day for results, it got less and less hopeful.\nSo I sent a complaint to the European Commission.\nThey agreed that Ireland were breaching EU law by delaying the process.\nI\nian\nok lisa said that. so......\n\nPaul\nThey directed us towards a law section specifying exactly how long they are allowed.\nTwo weeks, or four if they contact the Irish authorities.\nStill no result.\nI\nian\nwhat I suggest ...\n\nPaul\nToka got a new job helping students apply for universities in the UK.\nI am going to the south of Egypt to work a week for the owner.\nThey need some English speaker to be the front of some new English centre they are opening.\nI\nian\nwait slow down\n\nPaul\nOh, sorry.\nI\nian\none thing at a time lets work this out together\nrealistically the visa will not happen at moment right?\n\nPaul\nI really have no idea.\nIt could happen any thursday.\nI\nian\nGiven the previous failed attempts and the delays I think you.... as an adult have to maybe accept it that the EGY goverment will not allow her to leave. So your in a situation\n\nPaul\nOf course Egypt will let her leave.\nThere is no restriction on that...\nI\nian\nI would be thinking of staying in egypt with toqa\n\nPaul\nAnd there has only been failed national visa attempts, for visits.\nTo the UK.\nWith the such long delay, I can not but help it be on the back of my mind now.\nBut if it does come through, it could be a bit disrupting.\nWe would have three months to decide to leave.\nI\nian\nwait...\nI know Toqa cant get intouk right?\n\nPaul\nNot unless we live in another EU country for six months and the UK is still in the EU.\nI\nian\nok so...... \ntoqa has a full time job in egypt and you can possibly work too?\n\nPaul\nYes.\nI\nian\nok. \nmy advice from e me\nIf you can get a job..... stay there for time being. \nJust until things settle as this country and eu is a mess\n\nPaul\nWell yeah, but if the UK has left, we will have no chance of living in Scotland.\nI\nian\nif you are both working and have a roof above your head thats a dam sight more than you would have in eu at  moment\n\nPaul\nIf the Irish visa comes through and we can work there for six months, and the only thing I would worry about then is the UK illegally delaying her application so that the law changes and they can reject it.\nOr we learn dutch and live in the Netherlands under a shengen visa.\nYeah, the thought of moving to the EU is risky and uncertain.\nBut also a door that could shut.\nI\nian\nPaul Im trying to do whats best for you and Toqa. Ireland is over flowing with people at the moment .... just like Calais.... all wanting to get into and trying to work. Im really concerened that the doors you are taking are effecively leading no where. I know in my heart you want best for yourself and toqa, and I know toqa wants to leave egypt, but right now with the immegrant crisis in the uk you are struggling. If toqa remains in a job and you can work the clear option is to stay for the time being\nPlease Paul.... think about it. Its better to have a roof above your head, some support around you, with an income..... than nothing and no income. Its that simple. \n\nPaul\nI have talked to Toka. I have heard your advice. But, respectably, I would like you to live six months here before you advise living here longer. I understand your point for basic securities, but you are not aware of the problems living here. \nToday\nI\nian\nThats something that you must have known   talked to Toqa over the months before you met. It was your decision to move to Egypt which we all accepted. The problem now is dont moan about it.... you have to do whats best for you and Toqa. And right now Im advising you to stay in Egypt if you have the chance of a job rather than risk everything here\nPaul if your unhappy.... if you cant do it anymore in Egypt.... Just come home. There will be nothing to be ashamed of. We can all work together to try something else. Maybe a far eastern country. But you need money to survive. \nOk i have waited for a reply for over an hour.Its not often we get to speak but there is one thing I know, Without an income.... you and Toqa anint going anywhere. Simple. Think about it! Its a fact of life. If I cant survive properly in this country with Jane working too what chance do you and Toqa have with the prospect of no job and no where to live? For gods sake son think. Stay where you are for the time being.  I love you and dont want you to make a huge mistake xxx\nI\nAll i want is for you to succeed  with Toqa. Make the best decision for you both. Love you and miss you so much xxx\n\nPaul\nLook dad.\nI understand your concern.\nBut you are jumping to so many conclusions.\nFirst of all, to think that toka and I are not reading each others messages to each other.\nThe UK is changing, but to call it the worst it has been, this is an insult.\nHave you ever read labour history of the UK? Or anything about the development of capitalism in the UK?\nIt might very well be the worst during your life, and this I have no doubt.\nYou growing up when labour unions started taking power of the country.\nAnd now we have Teresa May.

I was cooking flour in a pan.<br>And when I see you going on holiday all the time and buying food because you like it and not because of the cost.<br>And then you complain that you work all the time and have no money.<br>You tell me that if I move to the EU I will be homeless. I would not have a roof above my head.<br>And here is one of the worst sentences you made tonight, so I will break it down. Because I was astounded at the logic here.<br>&quot;Given the previous failed attempts and the delays&quot;. There have been zero failed EU immigration attempts. There have been zero failed EU visa attempts. To equate UK national immigration law to EU is absurd.<br>So we can take this to be, &quot;given the delays I think you... as and adult&quot;.<br>Okay so you think if I do not agree with you, it would make me childish?<br>And finally, the conclusion of the only valid premise, &quot;given the delays&quot;, &quot; you have to maybe accept it that the EGY goverment will not allow her to leave.&quot;<br>I mean, really?<br>That conclusion is completely false. The government have no problem with her leaving. And even if she did has a delayed Irish visa application, they still would not care if she left Egypt.<br>And then you used this argument to tell us to stay here.<br>One sentence back and you said, &quot;realistically the visa will not happen at moment right?&quot;.<br>The visa could happen at any moment. As if using the word realistically in your sentence made you the down to earth person here.<br>I am not going to get into anything you sent Toka.<br>But please, as your son, I want you to start respecting me a little better.<br>I am perfectly aware of my situation. More than anyone else, in fact.<br>I appreciate that you are trying to care, and to give good advice, and to look out for us.<br>But if you want to express what you did want to express, say something along the lines of, &quot;Paul, I am worried about the situation you could get into by immigrating to Ireland or the UK. I, personally, feel like it is getting harder and harder to meet ends meat here, and I worry that you and Toka will be no better off in Ireland. If you are living fine in Egypt, perhaps consider living there a while longer until things look a bit brighter.&quot;<br>I can take your concern like this. And it will be on my mind when I make decisions.<br>But how you did it today was a total disaster.<br>You keep telling me to think about it. Over and over. As if I do not think about it.<br>As if I have not thought about all scenarios you can come up with.<br>When it comes to thinking about my life, I am the one who thinks most about it.<br>I do not want to look up the average quality of life of immigrants to Ireland vs our current to prove something. I do not want to look up statistics on immigrants to the UK. I do not want to look up employment rates of unskilled labourers vs non-arabic speakers.<br>You did not look these things up when you tried to use them as warnings, and neither will I.<br>I just want you to express concern without throwing in all these mishmashed, unsourced reasons.<br>You are my dad. I can take your word for things. I can respect you and what you say.<br>I did not reply for two hours, I just did not know how to. I was just going to accept it and leave it.<br>I went to Toka and she got an equally long message. I was still just going to leave it.<br>I came back and you were still going. Saying the same thing. You told me, &quot;for god sake, think&quot;.<br>If you know how much money we had, if you just immigrated to Ireland, if you had lived in Egypt with us for a long time, if you had calculated budgets for living in Ireland, if you looked up social support and immigration law in Ireland, then you could mention this.<br>But the only message I get is, country mess, immigrants, think, no chance, no money, no prospects, immigrants, think, going nowhere, mistake, do what is best, no income, simple.<br>02:51<br>And finally, given all the messages I sent while we were talking at the same time. You addressed none of them. You came with a message to give. And you wonder why I was not replying? ","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"For context, there is a boot partition that has kernel stuff for the pi, and the initramfs loads packages and config diffs into ram.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I would expect the people at intel to do it in a few hundred lines in a day.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Who knows, gpus are so abstracted it is hard to take them seriously.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I can know how cpus work and I can send them instructions.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why on earth do we need graphic drivers. Why is a standard instruction set and a compiller not okay for GPUs?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or at least combine the two processors and send appropriate instructions to the gpu part.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Say I send 48 add instructions in a row, the cpu can run four at a time, but if the gpu could do these instructions too, why not let the processor send instructions to the gpu cores?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why can we not have processors with a small number of complex cores, and a large number of simple cores?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Very much a system on chip.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Your last long sentence pretty much sums it up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It would not be the compilers job.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The cpu will process instructions in parrallel that it can, without instructions to do so.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"This is the parralellism I mean.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Like there are 4 ADD sections in a core, and as long as you use different registers and they do not depend on results, the cpu will run them at the same time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It would be the compilers job not to use the same registers for sequential add instructions.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well yeah, this is per core level.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"To use both cores, that is the compiller's job.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why not just have 16 add sections, one core, and 4x as many registers?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Do you have any idea how cold I am?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Down to 8C this weekend's nights.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have never worn a jumper under my onesie.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I would just put the heating on.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Do they not play test it?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"At least not the tutorial.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The tutorial room looks like a shitty unreal engine demo room for fabrics or lighting from 2008.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Only in (spoiler), and in 2v2.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then again, it might be that I force the higher clock speeds.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No idea if it uses that normally.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Can not imagine someone sitting with a dos program that randomly selects a person.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I am home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"There is a profile system on android so I can log in as my user and have no access to toka's stuff.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"WHO IS SALMA","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"BIRO IS A PEN","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The base amount first, then the fixed amount based on how good I am.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think the 3000 was just to give me a number.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I really do not expect to be paid more than the person with a computer science degree, or someone who has worked on the projects for a long time.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"They have a 4 (Megabyte he said), but probably a 4 Mibibit connection shared with 15-20 people.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Which could be pretty bad.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"When a new android virtual machine image is 400-700 MiB, and the android environment is 1.5GiBish.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Maybe it really is a 4Megabyte connection.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-173\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Ah, okay, will have a look soon.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It really depends on who operates in the lossie exchange with fibre, and who provides a static IP.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Built in infinite research is going to be good.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Mining productivity 32 :D\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Talktalk and sky are the only operators in lossie other than bt.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The problem with all three is they try to sell you add on shit like television, telephone, tele everything.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Just checking which company has the better consumer ratings.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Sky, talktalk, and BT all rated just under three stars.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The problem is that if the internet is not working, the only people who can do anything about it are BT.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Talk talk, sky, etc they can not touch BT's equipment.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And since they were a public monopoly, and then privatly sold, they have an almost infrastructure monopoly.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"However, the speed at the house in lossie is limited to a level which is provided by the package below, I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And, I can look into using a dynamic DNS, perhaps we can get rid of the static ip with a seperate service, then we can switch back to BT residential, and get rid of the 24 hour repair service thing.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will look into that tomorrow though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Another thing, you can pay the line rental yearly, which saves around 20% on line rental I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Since line rental is 17 or so a month, that adds up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or we could go the cheap route.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Might be possible to get unlimited internet for 215 a year.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But at 2.5 times slower, which you would probably not notice.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That should include line rental, which would be insanly cheap. But I will look more tomorrow.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is not slow. that is the house wifi.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Baaaby.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You can close it.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Ah, it is not too bad.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do you get much time there?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Everyone here is going to Dreampark on thusday. You have work but you are invited if you want to be sick or off or something.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do you want to ask for the day off maybe?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"50EGP each, we will all leave from the office. Not sure about transport.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have no idea what it is like\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"HEADING HOME.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Currently the bt you buy is the same package as the origin max.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"However, if you want the internet under half the price and do not mind halving the speed, origin broadband is good.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"At first glance origin broadband is 18GBP an month for 17/2Mbps, and origin fibre will be around 48GBP a month for 38/10Mbps.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No, but what will make your access much faster is getting the telephone cable to the middle floor.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Me and toka use 2/0.5Mbps and we stream youtube videos fine.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So 17/2 is much much faster.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Currently you get about 45/6.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But only in the kitchen and living room, connected to Internet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They do provide you with a router for free.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"They offer a static IP for 1.49GB a month. Cheaper than BT which is 5 or 6.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://www.originbroadband.com/packages/supersaver-deals This is the pay 12/24 months in advance page.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"And how long it would take to switch.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Ask about adding a static ip to the order.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Should do.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"paul.t.meredith@btconnect.com\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I researched it and based my choice on customer satisfaction. \n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Line rental costs 18GBP a month.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So nothing is 10GBP a month that includes line rental.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is 19GBP a month, with this clause, \"Sky network areas only. New Sky Broadband, Talk and line rental customers joining without Sky TV only. 12 months minimum contract.

 {"body":"This is a death threat.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It should be reported to the university and the police.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And if it was in jest, she needs to make a strong case and learn a lesson.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You got your parents involved, right?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Complaining about a death threat takes precedence over a letter.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And when she tries to give you an F, complain again.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Make things work correctly.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Complain to a lot more people than that.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But the lecturer will deny it and you might have a hard time making people believe you.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Tell me when you leave.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Also, do you want beshamel.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think we over feed them.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I want beshamel.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If you tell me when you leave I can start making it and have it almost ready.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I already ate one of everything.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"A plum, a sugar bun, a date thing, and three golashes.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will make mango juice and tea.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am fine, be fine.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"......... SO DO YOU WANT BESHAMEL\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will make tea.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I like it crispy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So we put the sauce on and put it in a tray and grill it for a while.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Until it is cripsy and brown.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Is she ready to pounce on her enemies?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"She is looking older every photo.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not yet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I told her to give me a message before she leaves so I can start cooking.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nope.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My sister loved these.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But I always hated the smell.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I used to get my parents to open the car windows when she had them.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Is this her pack lunch?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yes.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Is there a difference between dry/active/etc?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"28\" or 32?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think the photo is from the wrong perspective.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not bad. Waiting for toka to come home to have beshamel.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"White sauce pasta, but no milk or anything.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What is the washing powder and fabric softner you use?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Thought I would get some so the smell reminds me of home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well, we boil this powder in a pan and then grill the pasta until it is brown.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Should I wait some minutes before starting?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How long do you think you will be?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Be home soon, and be safe, and avoid everything.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Love you <3\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah I might, I have had bad experience with the yeast here though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It never seems to work.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Same thing stopping you.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"work, toka.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why will you not go out somewhere with me?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hi.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hi.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am not sleepy.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No long.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What will you do?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Okay.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I just got home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"There was no internet at work today.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hi.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Same with st, actally.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They all take -fn for a font string.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You should upload your dwm config to a remote git.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"But I have used 1080p most of the time for a long time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not sure what I use now, noto sans mono or inconsolata.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The huge character set is too appealing.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Wait I will get my current font.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Dmenu I use 18 for 1080p, and 14 for st. Inconsolata.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I usually go 1.5x scale with 4k.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"2x is too crippling, and 1x is too small.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But it depends on your screen size.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah I tried playing the last one you said and it was boring.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Will have to look up crash.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Well, eggs and cheese.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And of course eventually it will be cheaper to just grow meat than growing an animal.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Okay so a 28 would seem huge.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nah.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But I would never go smaller than 24.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Too small to not scale ui though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"25p for 8 peaches.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Second thing I tried after a tree.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Official kotlin support on android.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And android studio 3.0.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And with kotlin native becoming a thing, native compiled android apps could be near.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"\"Android runtime (ART) is the managed runtime used by applications and some system services on Android. ART and its predecessor Dalvik were originally created specifically for the Android project. ART as the runtime executes the Dalvik Executable format and Dex bytecode specification.\"\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Had to look that up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Still byte code.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Android 7 brought JIT to ART which apparently complements the ahead of time compiler.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Art is a run time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Native code needs no runtime.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That seems a bit clearer.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"kotlin should be compilable on any verson though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I guess lenovo used x86.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hi.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Spotify caches the data, so uses as much and more than just keeping the songs.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, but the app once you run out of space will start deleting old songs to get space for the new songs.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And the songs can be deleted by android at any time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And when the app is uninstalled.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And spotify is riden with ads.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Count up from that.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not really. \n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It was my first and the reason I tried.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where is tagamo3?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Have you tried your keyboard yet?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You can try to play nouvea bianche\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"C is the one to the bottom left of the two black keys.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If it is a black to the right, it is the letter + # (sharp).\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Os a C# is a note on the line below the bottom with a # and is the first of the two black keys.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"A flat is the same key but half down.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So C# is the same as Dflat\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Okay go gog ogo.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No. But that whole thing does not matter anymore.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"But where is my minecraft time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think I do not have long today.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will start cooking when you get home?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you coming.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No, there are three parts.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Tiny things.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"About 2kg max I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"88.5gbp for you, 269gbp for the others.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"358 total\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"300 is probably enough for me.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Which is 7000egp.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Look at you with your fancy new computer.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What hardware does it have?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"** Good morning.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I thought about it too, but for the same price you can buy modern hardware that performs much better.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So I quickly rejected the thought.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"This one is 2 x quad 2.8ghz second generation core processors, 16 GiB of DDR2 667mhz.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And a Radean HD 2600XT 256MiB.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It really suprised me by the hardware for such an old computer.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It must have cost a fortune when it was new.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No way.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Never ever buy a hard drive.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or a laptop :/","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or respond to an ad that does not list the exact processor, and age of the machine.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Also intel HD 4000 is too old now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The zombie level?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"COUNTING DOWN UNTIL FOOD TIME\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why is it not here?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"ME TOO","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I managed to get 10.12.6 installed and my passwords and ssh/gpg keys working.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":":D\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Mumble?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I AM HOME\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What no. I only want to buy 300gbp.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You will have to convert more money to egp for the rest of the costs.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You give me 300gbp in my bank account, and I give you 7000egp when you get here.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You need more egp than that to pay for the inn, and food, etc.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, but you need to get that from the post office.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, if you want.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Wait.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I might get something cheaper.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Okay.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not sure yet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Want to do a video tour of my items?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"As in a video call.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Is she home?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did she not reply?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where are you.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No idea.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I asked though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"She should be home any moment now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hmmm, 5:17 probably.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Okay.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Toka was at work.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"We can do it tomorrow, it is late now.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or now.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Toka fell asleep.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Wake up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is music, and almost bed time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why are you not home?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you see anything?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Anything worth note.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I made a shopping list of computer parts.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Okay juice and bed time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hmmm, I had a sugar bun.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No power in a new city?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You should have to kil yourself in the last mission.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"HMMMMMMM.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"IS IT OUR WEDDING ANI","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Wait, trying to get my layout working.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"What is the b.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Good morning.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It was dark and gloomy.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah okay.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am so hungry.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have fateer at home and apple juice.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The shop no longer sells orange juice :(","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Have at 7 too.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Going home now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Twenty minutes?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not yet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Actually, maybe not. But maybe.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Home to do a tour?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I never got those messages.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hold on.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do you have the option for video here?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, it fails.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh, yeah they will have a lot of interviews.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hmmm.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nothing serious.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Just your preferences.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They are just checking you are not insane.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think the fact you got an interview means they are going to give you the job.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Morning shift finishes at 2:30.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They have a lot of positions.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They double their employees this time of year.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think not public ones.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"There is not much childcare at all.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not much care at all.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"In Cairo?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well yeah, you probably could.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"People love foreigners.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do you want interviews in your time here?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are we moving the Meredith family to Egypt?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Also, jamie.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Your pay would not even cover the flights.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You are looking at 2 months work for a single flight.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I mean, I easily got a job in the field I really wanted in.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And I imagine doing the same in the UK would have been impossible.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Neither can I.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I suppose children can not speak English.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Anything to do with childcare?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will keep an eye on the job lists.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://wuzzuf.net/a/Jobs-in-Cairo\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"This is the best site for it, I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The top posts are extra paid to be at the top, so skip past the top.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Quite a few preschool english teacher jobs.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not seeing anything with childcare though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"This is old, but the same area toka works.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"3500 should be your absolute minimum wage.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Like you do not get a quote in the interview for a solid number, you should reject them.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You can really negotiate here.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://wuzzuf.net/jobs/p/85421-English-Teacher-Assistant-The-Baby-Academy-Cairo-Giza-Egypt?l=sp&t=sj&a=child\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I still have no visa here hahaha.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No work permit either.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"See if you can survive a week first.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Is poppy going to hold you back for the next five years?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where are you.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I did that once.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hi.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Fine.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is our aniverisary today.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is bad at first but once you get to know everyone in the factory, it is good.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"When are you home today.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Jeez.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh nice. Which factory?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Morning or back?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I was in the biscuit factory, which I liked, but it is the hardest.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"All the others are so slow.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Jeez.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ZrKehQ_xc\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Cracked at the ferris wheel.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You should have certificates for those things.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Canteen cover is making food and selling food in the canteen.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You actually have to make sandwhiches.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Covering while the permentant staff are away.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They do not care about lack of experience, you should claim you have none.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Okay.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"He came.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Maybe his stream.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Probably just people looking through matches and gamemodes.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you finished.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You should do a few hours checking an online food safety course.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Should ease your lie.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"There is probably a good video on youtube.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And refilling the vending machine and counter.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And cleaning up after everything.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And doing the dishes.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And putting the chairs out and back.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And topping up the free biscuit boxes.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Keeping track of orders for the week.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Heating up soup.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Keeping water jugs topped up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Canteen is not a full shift I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Usually 8.5 hours. 50 minute break or something. Depends on the factory.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Pull you through?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So you are not working in the canteen.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Just covering when needed.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I thought you were just in the canteen.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Good morning.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I never noticed it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I just thought he was saying there are fewer men.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Is it disco day, or karate day?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hmmm yes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The t-shirt has smudges on it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hungry.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That is all I am.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I had none at home.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I miss my linux already.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I need my tiling window manager and freedom to edit how things work.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I wish xcode was on linux.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think me even more so because I wrote patches for the software I used all the time.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Here I also do not have full control over my keyboard input.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"NO","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am really busy right now though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am late today.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am so hungry.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"i started learning how to speak backwards.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Here is me singing happy birthday backwards.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"WHO HAS A WEEKEND","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"You just missed the longest yeah boii ever (NEW WORLD RECORD 2017)","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Mine craft in an hourish?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Wow, that was not phone worthy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"15 minutes later and he has not replied :/\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You heard me.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am a liar.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have stuff getting in the way.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What are you doing?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Only if you bring juice.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"When are you home?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nop.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No koshary?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Okay, your order has been placed.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Thank you for using Chiefat™.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"When do you start?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is an mp3.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If your phone can not play an mp3...\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Try not to talk too much to people until you know who is who and who is good and who is bad.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Because you will have to work with them every day.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So you want to make the correct impression, and talk to the better people.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You get an upper hand if you just pretend to be quiet and shy and observe the others.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then after a while you can know what not to say to each person.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Just say yes to the manager, and do what the manager says.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Pretty sure morning shift has a lot more older people on it though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"At first you will also be too slow at everything and fail a lot and be annoying to others.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But onec you are good at everything it is easy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You get given shoes.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Clean them each morning or you will have disgusting shoes eventually.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They provide wet wipes and shoe spray.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do it each morning.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"For the first few weeks you will be too slow at everything and it feels awful.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But eventually you do it without thinking.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Also, people are used to really slow people coming all the time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Still annoys them though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Also, I would leave your phone at home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You get a locker, but they are shit.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And if you want to lock it, you have to take your own lock.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Curious to know which factory you are going to.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think you will not be canteen.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I know the one, yeah she is nice.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Canteen is usually permenant staff all year round.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"She hires too many people jeez.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I was also like four years ago.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Take your home keys.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You get free biscuits at lunch.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And free water.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If you want more than that, bring a pack lunch or a couple of pound for buying a lunch.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My pocket.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Most people do, because they have locker keys too.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But make sure you do not lose them.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And a key comes in very useful opening things when you do not have a knife.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No idea.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What the fuck is that pallet mansion?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you becomming a shopoholic?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But what happens when you eventually do have enough money.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well yeah, but it was edited to look like he did it alone, and it was massive.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Come in.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I woke up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why did you fall asleep so early?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"About an hour ago.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Thirsty.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh wait, coffee.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You left half a tomato here.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Minecraft?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Look like 20% to me.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Starting it now, let me get coffee.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I put it in the bathroom behind the toilet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And marmite.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hello.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"6 year old, peppa pig?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Scooby do then I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I think I am the wrong person to answer though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The bus to where?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What are you doing?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you hear my recordings?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://soundcloud.com/mxmtoon/feelings-are-fatal-something\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"(Is it too late to sampoligiza?)\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They both do.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The chrome default ad blocker is a disaster.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Also the number of people who use the internet without blocking ads is disgusting.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If it was a choice between the internet with ads and no internet, the no internet choice would win for me.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"kurgsgraft","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Firefox also has sponsered content on the new tab page, and some vodafone owned voip service built in.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They also track users (without exception) during the installing extensions process.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They consider the data too valuable.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think the best bet is any browser with plenty of privacy extensions.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where are you.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where were you?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hmm, no.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"What will you order?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You will order fattah…?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Fattah is just rice and bread and should be the cheapest thing ever.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I already had samboosa today but I am craving more.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Can't a boy have his hobbies?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Maybe.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hmmmm.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Why are jam jars so hard to open.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What is your favourite food on earth so far?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why do I like the smell of onions on my hands so much?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"This is the most boring thing.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I would rather eat almost anything else.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Only a few things are worse.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Like guavas.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And rye bread.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I had more samboosa.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I do not want to sleep though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I never want to sleep when toka is not home.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I do just want to keep eating though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Both.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Had MegaPoop 2.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Oh shit.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oatcakes lines usually never change.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Very repetative.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, dominate the thing to make sure it registers.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You can swipe again, it does not matter.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You found the bus place though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, every 30 minutes or an hour you move around.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That way you learn to do everything.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Anyway, glad it was fine.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"She said it was fine.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"When are you home.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Jeez.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Which class?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Still leaving at 8?","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I hate having to take all the seeds out of the eggplants though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nevermind.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Pasta for dinner?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah now it is close.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That is not an android navigation drawer.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The SETTINGS text is not centered.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Like someone has placed it manually.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nah, you will last in shortbread 2.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is nothing like elgin or the biscuit factory.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Once you get the hang of things, nag the trainer about \"getting your jobs signed off\".\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Once you finish 3 months, you get a pay rise.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Eugh mine too.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You will be home around 9?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"EUGH NO BREAD","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I mostly only like material design.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/navigation-drawer.html","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Everything is very strict.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Easier to do the real design than mock one up in photoshop.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How are you?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will go to the bakery.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The internet keeps dying.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The ETA is 3 hours 50 :(","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Which as long as we blast, is tonight.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I went to the bakery.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I started it as soon as I got home.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is downloading sequentially, so we can start about 3:10.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I got breadsticks, bread, bread buns, and bread fateer.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then I went and got bread fool mahawig.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The very first thing I designed was paulmeredith.com","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I ran a website that was basically a profile for me and my friends.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If you have 23 pounds, could you get coffee?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Okay bring orange juice too.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And noodles.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And a motorbike.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Make sure it is the big coffee pack, once they charged us 23 for the small one too.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I used to have a running joke with my mum.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Every time she asked if I needed anything (which was a lot), I said a motorbike.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or if I came downstairs and she asked what I was looking for, it was a motorbike.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I really want one of the browsers to officially ship as an AppImage.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Good morning.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Good morning.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am okay.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you fine?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What is wrong?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Anxiety for a reason?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":":(","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No, I told magdy about my excess hours and asked him if he had a preference.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"He said he will pay overtime for the hours.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why are you accepting that?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Overtime is always optional.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Their fault for not scheduling correctly.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Their fault for not hiring enough workers to do the hours.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why do you take the fall for things they are doing wrong?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They should suffer for making mistakes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No, you offer to suffer instead of them.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How is an 11 hour working day not suffering?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I still have an hour.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you drinking too much caffiene?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Too much caffiene is the only reliable way I become anxious.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you hla?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Does she still have leukemia?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"There are a gang of 7 year olds with sticks hitting everything outside.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I hope they hit each other.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"One of my friends has luekemia when he was 8.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"He was fine by the end of primary school though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They are actually worse than the stray dogs.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What is the thing you like best about you?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Any, both.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I like being happy and I like orange juice, but I like one better.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The entire thing, not a single flaw.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Every perceives reality slightly different, but too big and you are failing to correctly observe reality.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You can perceive it with a different perspective and interpret it differently.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But I think this can not be the best thing.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"This is just different.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I do not like mashed potatoes because my family made too much of them and made me eat them.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So I view potatoes with negative thoughts.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What part of your body are you least satisfied with?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well, that seems normal.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You should try to stop caffiene for a while.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"See if it helps.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Although, the first few days can be hell.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My description is: no motivation to do things, sleeping all the time, and someone trying to spoon your eyes out 24/7.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you leave.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If I remember correctly, tea has about 30% the amount of caffiene.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not sure about the dust tea here though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It seems stronger.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you ever coming home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"http://tabbycats.club/9p89wh\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am sweating so much.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Prepare for onion farts.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hello.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What can be wrong with thighs?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My thighs are like a horses.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My waist is a little fat though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My worst part is probably my bum.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It gets ingrowns and they irritate and are red spots.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And it gets so hairy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My eyebrows grow too much.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So many come out when I pull on them.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And it joins in the middle when I forget to pull the middle ones with tweezers.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I do not like anything that is a contious lossing battle.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"continuous?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"perpetual\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No matter how many times I shave my legs, they are always hairy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Tired I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"For a short while.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Sorry.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No. I leave her for a moment and she gets sucked into her phone.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not yet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I just do not want to order and the next day something better comes out.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am about to now.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I was shaving and cutting my nails and eating.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Goodnight mariak.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Leaving work now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Wait.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am still here for a while.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But using the phone so I am slow.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What did you have?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where are you.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Fine mostly.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am almost off.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Good morning.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you still alive?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I need more coffee.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Home time now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I want to get a build first though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Quickly.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"With photos?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"All there is for that is suffering.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Unless you have a great camera, and consistant bright light conditions, any photo recognition is unusable.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Somethings work when they have high contrast.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Like bar codes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And there are so so so many different coins and notes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And are you meant to lay out all the currency without overlap on a white table before taking a photo from the roof?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"This is like trying to train your dog to clean the house.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Even if you did, it would be shit and slow at cleaning.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Our coins are designed to feel different and unique.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Our notes are different sizes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Google has a cloud photo recognition service.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But I really really doubt it will work for currency.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, give it a few weeks and it will be easy.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Everyone is shit when they start.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Is the feeder the hardest for you?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or the boxer?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Eventually you stop counting.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"A tip is to count 2,3,4,5,6... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Just skip counting the first one.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do you do skillets?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will be back in 30 minutes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah eventually all these things you do with your eyes shut at double speed.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"WHO HAS A WEEKEND <3\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No more onion farts :(\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Late but home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If someone can use machine learning to do that task, they belong at google.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I like the smell.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Eat, watch, sleep.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Now is my rest time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What will you do.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will wait until next sunday.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Will you watch rick and morty?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Tell him to hold his horses.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I did some code edits to dwm to make it work a certain way.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think you are going to love it.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hi.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am configuring stuff.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I made an edit to the source of my window manager that adds a property to windows which makes them ignore focus shifting and not draw borders.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And I made a dock appear on every tag.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So now I am getting the icons on the dock nice.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you awake?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I was waiting for toka to come home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And now I have no idea.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How are you feeling about people?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Rick and morty.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Do you want to commit your life to him?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Until you do.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Your parents would probably only let you live with him if you marry, and then you are stuck.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Probably stuck but it is good right now.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I should go to bed before my body collapses.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Goodnight mariam.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am still not tired.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Between 17 and 20 I was not looking for a partner.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I never was.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But I found one.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I woke up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh wow.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Does it make you hate teaching them less?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hahahaha.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Sabah el whereismycoffeenooor.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, but can you even take them?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hello.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am making coffee.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have coffee.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you just wake up?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Chanting children woke me up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well they signed up for the rest of the year.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Good morning.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What the hell.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"A new mitchel and webb series is coming out.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Just a comedy series where they are brothers.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://youtu.be/fczItbbB-OA\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Although.....\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Going to order it now.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The computer should arrive between the 22nd and the 26th.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then 21-22nd should be a usb card reader, two cables, two micro sd cards, one pack of two ram modules, one samsung ssd.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yes, but it is tiny.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hungry.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hungry at work, hungry at home.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How are you? \n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you stop tea and coffee?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It would help if you put two of the things inside the computer.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I can step you through it in a video chat.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then it will look like you are just taking your computer, with two cables, and a keyboard.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And the fragile things would be safe in the computer.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I ordered the shopping list.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Yeah I feel awful, at least my nose has stopped running so much today.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Now is the coughing.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Toka's dad had his spine operation.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"We saw him yesterday, he seems okay, high on drugs probably.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But the doctor never said how the operation went yet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"WHAT IS THIS","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you even check to see if I had had my morning joe yet?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So rude.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"A movie was made about us?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, a little.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How is your dad?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did any doctors say anything?","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Is he moving around?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Spoiler: the operation was cancelled last minute.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I spent ages organising all our data now.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I should have lots of me soon, but the photos are not with me yet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I woke up.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you awake?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think not.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I need linux game recommendations.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Maybe something I missed because my pc was too slow.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am thinking about pillars of eternity.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I played a tomb raider game on your pc I think.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will buy insurgency.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Can you try to change the internet today?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well it is not me.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"With the island...?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is not the newest one.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Fuck them for dropping numbers for the game names.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is just becoming a shittier version of the male game they make.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Playing it, I am at work.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"She must be on my pc.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"She does not have a steam account.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Who knows.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Uncharted.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Seems like the male tomb raider game to me.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Tomb raider seems to have lost its style and just become a clone of uncharted, but worse.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You do that in uncharted.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"True.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They seem to be adding gameplay mechanics for no real reason.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I want mystery and history.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And puzzles.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am fine, just blowing my nose a lot.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"140 pound, 140gb, 2mb/s","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"megabit","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"ish","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The sink is fine.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nah blowing in the sink is better for my nose.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh I am at work now, I will check when I get home.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The change of diet really messes with your poo for a while.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Just at work.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"WHA","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"For how long?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The only thing stopping that is Jamie.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Train her to poop in the bathroom.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Jamie would let you come indefinetly?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Jeez, the only reason I am here is toka.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah but working is many months.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"My work is pretty great.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have so much control and freedom, doing stuff I feel at home with.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is a short cycle, and I only work 6.5 hours a day now.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I probably will not be able to get time off work this time in march though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have had so many days off already.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But I do not work much, so you can just play games while I am away.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And clean cat poop.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":":/","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I want samboosa.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Also a bicycle pump.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is pretty urgent.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hmmmmm.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have no money on me.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think sambousa is okay for when I get home, then we can roast vegetable it up later on.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, we can take a market trip later.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"<3","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Okay.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Keyboard is working exactly as it should without any configuration on mac :D","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They liked it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The smallest they have seen, obviously.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Soon.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Five minutes","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No idea when they do.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I started in April.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But honestly, he pays me more than he should.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"He pays me a salary, so even if I am off for whatever reason, I still get the same.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But not really a salary because if I work more, he pays me extra.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think everyone else gets paid for the number of hours they work.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am the most reliable one here though.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am always at work.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I can probably download life is strange for windows.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Shit it is 13GiB.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Jesus, btn got disabled.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Today.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I used it this morning.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I got our gg account back.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It was because of ips.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I added the server in france to the vpn staff approved ip.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But we are going to have to both use it if we want to share.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I suspect btn just did the same today.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Btn, no idea yet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"gg: went into irc and bluffed my way through.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"never knew currfyg@gmail.com was an email address.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So that looked iffy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is the site log I think they use to spot it.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah, I am still seeding.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will have to do the same for btn, the mod of gg might be connected.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How much do you use them all?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"We could share my vpn and just be carefull not to not use it.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or have a dedicated browser for trackers, which uses a proxy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They would shit themselves if you accessed it through tor.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Assuming people must have only local computers is dumb.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh yeah even that.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If sending torrent files works, that would be easy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not sure if they monitor torrent traffic too, because seedboxes do not count as vpns.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Getting steamworld dig 2 now. \n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Have you learnt anything on your keyboard yet?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The steamworld dig .sh file is 50m, the install sh file.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not yet.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It was in an iso, in split rars, at 200m. \n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They are working on it though.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Next year.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I usually just call up your mother.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I just work up now.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"He made me.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think is best we get our own accounts.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"After things cool down, I think the easiest way would be for me to invite you from ptp to ptp.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have no idea which is the least suspicious method.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They piss me off.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Time to run our own tracker.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They do not know about that account.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They wanted to know the story of the ggn banning.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They wanted to know everything.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They wanted proof of ip ownership.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The fact tor is no allowed on these sites is crazy.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The annonimity of the users should be the most important.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"But they can also search by ip.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Yeah bringing up ggn was a mistake.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What about a gazelle tracker with a fully command line interface?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Returns a json list","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"site get with a torrent id","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"returns the torrent","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Honestly, I think public and unlogged is best.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But how do you ensure having all the torrents?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Torrents must be rated to filter out the spam.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or require an account and ban the account when they upload shite.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But have public sign up.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If they want to create another acount and upload again and again, fine?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Have a points system to reward seeding","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Give more points for seeding well rated torrents","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Yeah it is low, but just.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The normal is 80-100.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You can increase it by taking b6 suppliments and iron supplements.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It could mean a lack of b6, iron, or a sensitivity to gluten.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Apparrently doctors usually ignore an abnormal mvc count.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"MCH is Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"26-34 is normal for that.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So you are juuuuuuuuust low for it.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But again, low iron is the problem.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The high leukocyte count is too many white blood cells.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Which happens when you get ill.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Not really an issue I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I would take iron, b6, b12, and d12 or maybe d6 daily for a month or two and get another test.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Gluten is a thing in wheat.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Some people can not digest it so it builds up in the body and becomes harmful over time.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"About 1 in 100 people.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"And pfft, care about yourself first.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Did you sleep at 9pm?","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Do you like teal too?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I feel odd after meeting you.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I feel like I never spent enough time observing so I might forget.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Like maybe I wasted time.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But then I am also more convinced that the times are not as rare any more.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where we were and how you looked and what we did.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You can zoom over with the car you will steal.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You never replied when I said we got on the same bus as Mostafa.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I was at the front, gave a glance over the bus people, walked to the back after paying, gave him a second glance, *the glance intensified*, then I nudged toka and said, \"Look who it is.\"","format":"org.matrix.custom.html","formatted_body":"I was at the front, gave a glance over the bus people, walked to the back after paying, gave him a second glance, <em>the glance intensified</em>, then I nudged toka and said, &quot;Look who it is.&quot;","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"\"I was sitting at the back of the bus bored out of my mind, then the bus stopped and some people got on, \"SHIT\", said my mind as the sweat started pouring out of every folicle on my head.\"","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think toka said nothing.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nada in my head is still so young.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I feel like I have not seen her since we started talking.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Or that image is just stuck in my head.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"AND BREAD\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have some orange, apple, and banana.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"When are you coming.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Wake up.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am too late.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And noodles.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where are you.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is kind of sad that you are not here most of the time I am awake.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What happened with the guy making the space game by himself and burning out?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then a year later he made a long blog post.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It has been about a year since then.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And where is cube world?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They started release tonnes of new content screenshots and videos. But has there been an update?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Are you still not awake.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am off to work.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I will be back in twenty minutes.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hello.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Cube world is still dead after all the updates?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"July the 2nd was the last update.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What is your plan to fix your sleeping?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Set a bed time and stick to it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Make it 12 or 1.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And set an alarm for 8.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And always obey it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Where did you go.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am trying to get the internet before everyone come in and it is unusable.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Too many people downloading too much stuff.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"https://soundcloud.com/fadinglanguage/on-something-to-which-i-wont-admit-1","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you listen to this?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How are you going to get to abysaya in 45 minutes?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Baaaaby.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is steal all the internet before everyone gets here time.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Baroody is here but my stomach is not feeling good.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think you should.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Maybe.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Hahahahahahahaha.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"No way on earth could they control that.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The tickets are not unique.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That is a problem.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They should just charge the average.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Some people pay 2 pounds for 1 station.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Some pay 2 pounds for 12 stations.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"2 pounds should be the cost of the average, probably 3-4 stations.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The people paying for short trips compensate the ones going long.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And nobody complains.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Everyone will hate the new system.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nobody ever complaint that 12 stations costs the same as 1.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"If you are going 12 stations, the metro cart is empty most of the way.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"So to discourage filling empty carts is bad.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Charging more for busy carts makes sense.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But then it is not worth the time and complexity.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They already added adverts everywhere.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Have they sold the metro or something?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You do not expect the government to operate like a money hungry business.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Nobody trusts businesses.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"AND ADD A STOCK CUBE TO THE RICE","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"YES","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Just editing.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Actually, I have not started.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Fixing some ill defined issues with the android version first.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How was the class.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Well, I just managed to log into the driver and the socket crashes immediatly.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And the dashboard has no way of assigning cars to drivers, so I had to do that manually.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The dashboard also could not even create drivers.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The dashboard is still called Sindbad.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Let me google it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"***Qabi","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah I was forced to publish it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I told him to delete the cargo ones :/","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"You can use crashlytics beta deployment.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You can use google play beta program.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"These people piss me off.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Then again, maybe it would be just as bad if they knew too much about android.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I am hoping to get another pc soon and use linux again.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Mac OS annoys me so much.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"They will never be happy in any hotel.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Is it over now?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh no.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That will be horrible.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You will be working 48 hour weeks.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"On the phone.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Telephone support has to be one of the worst jobs.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The money is okay, and the experience is only good for telephone support and sales.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You could find so many more interesting jobs.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Telephone support is like a last resort; they hire anyone who can speak.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It will look bad on a cv if you can only keep a job for a month.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I support you having a small job, but less than 16 hours a week.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And in an area you actually enjoy.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah but they will not stay at our house.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They just never would.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you hear my voice note last night.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did it work in the app?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I have my coffee. What do you have?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Have you tried to make your own mocha yet?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Did you hear.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh I do not use riot so I did not see it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I SAW IT","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"AND I REPLIED","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Sorry for shouting.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh wow, it was 10 minutes.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh no it failed.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I will have to make an hour long message tomorrow night.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"We have not had breakfast yet.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"There is.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Busy.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"To cut the gum open?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah tooth removal is pretty cheap.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But it is brutal.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They crush the inside of it then pull it out.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I actually had a tooth removed without anastetic once.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It will also bleed for a day.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You have seen the videos of people in the USA having wisdom teeth out.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Nobody phones to make a request for an appointment.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They phone to making a booking.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah phone them.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Request systems are shitty.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It takes a couple of minutes to arrange a time you can both meet.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But you probably have to phone after 9:30 today.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It takes a couple of hours for someone to even notice a request.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Mariam.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"And eventually my mum and sister.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I spoke to toka in the morning, then made my mum and sister mediate.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Where are you.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Jeez.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I hope people paint horns on sisi.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"I remember the days when broadband first started.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They kept upgrading the speed for free.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"But yeah, may be free for a few months then not.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I mean they have throttling policies.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"You have because we hit it when we were there together.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That is when we found out about it.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"They have a chart on their website showing the time periods and limits.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah remember when we could not even watch youtube videos?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think I remember times when we knew it was throttling though, how else would I know about the chart?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Why.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"We are going to the dentist tonight :S","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Things are fine, cost 5gbp.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Mummy finds things funny I think.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"What the hell, polish and scale are how you keep your teeth from rotting long term.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Especially if you are not flossing.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Leave it a few years and the bits you miss each day will end up forming cavities and you will get ginivitis.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"32k, no excuses any more.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think not.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Attacks on what?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Have you not quit yet?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That person is going to go to jail.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Way to waste their life.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I do not know much about the police and how they work, but could you express concern to them and ask them if they are doing anything to make you feel safer?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Men fight back harder.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I think you should tell them everything but with the disclaimer, this is just what I have heard, I have no proof.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It could be useful.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is their job to find proof and check the rumors for validility.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"That sounds like a threat to me.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I would definitely tell them about that.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Who the fuck does she think she is.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"To say that requires some sort of knowledge of intent.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Otherwise it is a threat, or a bad joke.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Let the police figure it out.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Morning shift psychos.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Toka make lentil soup.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Yeah it was good.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Lentils, carrots, a tomato, a potato, and onions.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"Leaks yeah, but not sure about turnips.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Broth?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"So just boiled peas?\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Carrot and coriander is my favourite hummous flavor.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"It looks nice though, right?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"The graphic.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"She will get the skin cut next week.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I made a picture of my keyboard layout.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"It is a vector :sunglasses:","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"How are you today?","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"I would never work more than 38 hours a week.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"38 is too much for me.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"30 is okay.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And 20-24 would be great.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"And an hour travel there and back is my limit.","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body":"They have been increasing the graphics a lot.","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Go get \"golf with your friends\".\n","msgtype":"m.text"},
 {"body":"Oh actually, old nuc was 22 at 1280x1024, and new was 46 at 1920x1080.\n","msgtype":"m.text"},

 {"body": "Today we are introducing the Navigation component as a framework for structuring your in-app UI, with a focus on making a single-Activity app the preferred architecture. With out of the box support for Fragments, you get all of the Architecture Components benefits such as Lifecycle and ViewModel while allowing Navigation to handle the complexity of FragmentTransactions for you. Further, the Navigation component allows you to declare transitions that we handle for you, automatically builds the correct Up and Back behavior, includes full support for deep links, and provides helpers for connecting Navigation into the appropriate UI widgets, like the navigation drawer and bottom navigation. But that's not all! The Navigation Editor in Android Studio 3.2 allows you to see and manage your navigation properties visually:", "msgtype": "m.text"},

 {"body": "> Dear Mr Swinney,\n\nI currently live in Edinburgh, but I am originally from Moray where my mother is a secondary school teacher. Over the past few years there has been a well documented shortage in teachers, both primary and secondary, which I believe has been recognised by the Scottish Government. Given that I am from the area, and my mother still teaches there I am very much aware that despite efforts to address the problem by both the national and local governments, the situation has not only failed to improve but is actually worse than ever.\n\nA close friend of mine, who is also from the Moray area, married an Egyptian woman several years ago and thanks to the efforts of the Home Office has had to relocate to Cairo in order to live with her. His wife holds a 4 year bachelors in English language and literature, has 4 years of teaching experience and would be well qualified to teach in Scotland were it not for the PGDE requirement. I do understand this requirement and the necessity of maintaining teaching standards, and the person in question would be more than willing to undertake the necessary year of study in order to qualify. However, the cost of enrolling for this course is frankly obscene for any students from outside Scotland and even worse for those from non-EEA countries (approximately 15,000gbp). This person already has a close connection to Scotland and has on multiple occasions applied for visas to visit or remain in Scotland, and would in this case be able to greatly benefit the community. In addition to the issue of teaching recruitment in Moray, the friend in question would very much like the ability to return to Scotland with his wife. I hope you agree that this situation could be resolved to the benefit of all parties.\n\nAt this point in time I do not believe that there is any scheme in place to help people in this situation with both the intransigence of the Home Office visa system and the extreme financial burden placed on foreign students in obtaining a PGDE. The problem of cost is compounded by the uncertainty of being granted a work visa after study. Currently the course as I understand it, in Scottish universities, exists to train people to teach in Scotland, and I fail to understand how having large costs associated with the PGDE course benefits anyone. If I am in any way mistaken then please feel to correct me or to point me in the right direction. I would also appreciate any advice or help you can give on this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\nBenedict Rolfe", "msgtype": "m.text", "formatted_body": "<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Mr Swinney,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I currently live in Edinburgh, but I am originally from Moray where my mother is a secondary school teacher.
