HELLO
What up diddy poop.
You call.
Mumble.
Yo dawg.
Yo.
Hi.
Hfdshhddgb
Shit wrong place.
Exactly.
Thankfully you never need to do that again.
Yeah.
The app should let you change your password if you care to.
I am a pirate.
First picture I found.
Oh in app settings change your nickname to Lisa
Yes.
Three or four years ago.
This app should be better in every way, so you can get rid of the other app if you want.
Toka is applying for a visa, then we will travel under the eu directive.
She will be able to work and live there with me.
I see it.
Yeah.
Ireland are lenient and extend the EU laws, unlike the uk which would rather vote to leave the EU.
Well, hopefully easy jobs.
Yeah, I hope it all works out.
Yeah, should do.
Maybe come earlier.
Planning on august.
23ish.
Yeah sure, that is how we become liked with the immigration officer.
No, we have savings we will use on rent while we look for work.
We will stay in a hostel until we find a private landlord.
Maybe contact them before arriving.
Yep.
Dublin is super expensive.
But we will go wherever we will be hired.
South.
And Dublin is the Republic of Ireland.
If I can find work in a small place that would be perfect.
Also, it is not the north of ireland and the south of ireland.
It is the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, aka Ireland.
The north, is a part of the UK.
And Belfast is in the UK part of the Ireland island.
Ireland is an island.
Northern Ireland (aka, the UK) is at the north.
The rest is the Republic of Ireland, also known as Ireland.
Britain is an island. 
The country is called: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Island.
Ireland
Great Britain as you can see, excludes Northern Ireland, and is a historical name of a country that no longer exists.
I will look into that.
For the EU referendum, right?
Yes, obviously.
Yeah, I know.
3000 before selling furniture.
Flights are about 650, not the worst.
It is rented.
He owes me nothing, it was a gift and I trust if he really could spare the money he would have.
I am sure he is aware.
He worked non stop apparently, he needed a break.
I decided to just trust his decisions. 
He said he will help in any way he can.
Everything is fine right now.
Yeah, you should get out of overdraft.
You really do not want to use it.
When you hit the limit, you are fucked.
I had to eat flour.
I had to leave university.
Hey does the app work well?
I would not close it, you may need it in emergencies, just do not use it.
Apply for the discretionary as much as you can too.
True.
Just be very careful.
How is she doing financially? 
She will ask you for money when she gets low.
She has done to me.
No.
Does he cook?
Actually, what is his name?
I met a few people.
What is a mountain dog?
How old is he?
What is his job?
You will have to send a photo of it next to poppy.
Send it here.
Well, I would not mention that I will be coming back closer until we know for certain.
Mummy did mention the visit.
If you see mummy, get her to switch to the android version of this.
It lets you make an account.
Yeah, tesco stuff. I mean I make my own but I prefer the store stuff.
Yes.
Answer.
No idea.
You call me.
On the android app there is a giant phone symbol at the top.
Yeah.
Ah, upcoming feature for the iOS version.
Not yet.
Weird you could hear the call though.
No.
What. Why, is that message in pink?
Oh, when you mention the name Lisa.
The web version of this is really good too.
vector.im
And it works flawlessly on multiple devices at the same time.
Yeah.
It is an address bar.
JUST DO IT
Oh, you can redact messages too.
This is a message I did not mean to send.
Yes, it is called redacting.
I think because you are the admin of this room you can redact my messages.
But I wonder if the iOS client even lets you.
Here is a massive photo.
It will take a moment.
Just testing picture sharing with you.
I know the android client gives you the option to reduce the size of it.
Btw, if you try to get anyone to move to this chat, they can use the default server settings, I just prefer you use mine because it makes our chat history stay in our house. And I am private.
I believe you can add them using the email address they used.
It is 40% uploaded.
Neish?
I worked with a retard and an annoying guy who knew her.
The retard was Nathon Morrison. 
The annoying person was Michael something.
Nah, he worked morning shift.
Was is wrong with her?
Have not seen these people in a long time.
Wow.
Does carol have a child?
They all look a little heart deceasie. 
Mummy looks like she has put on a lot of weight.
Not always.
Look at a photo of her in the Netherlands when you were young.
She really needs to lose weight if she wants a pleasant later life.
They all look very similar.
Yeah, my face is pretty brown.
My legs are super white.
No.
I think they would if you were not going to thailand.
But you took an optional trip.
They do not care, it is an expense, and to not explain your debt, is fraud.
And they would see that you did not use your savings on these expenses.
The exact opposite can also be reasoned, that you used your savings for mummy money and travel, and the debt was for thailand.
And there is no difference.
You can apply, and hope, but you will have to give them three months financial statements, and you will have to explain the massive thailand expense by lying or telling them.
Come in.
If you tell them, they will use the reasoning above and I doubt they will feel any empathy for you.
Mummy was struggling to get this.
Way more than you.
Are you both at home?
Stop feeding the car tuna.
It happens when the chat server upgrades.
I know.
:(
It feels like you have been missing for a while.
Well, if I walk home it will be 7.
Yeah.
But this time, I cleared out the database.
Car
Vroom
It's a spoilt car if you give it tuna ffs.
Your car puked tuna.
HOI IV out.
Half the car can fall off and it was still a good buy.
Just order a new one.
Scotch tape looks the same.
For sure.
No one could tell.
Maximum four weeks from now.
It seems like a good car.
Toka sleeps with her eyes open.
It is super creepy.
Half, but I can see her pupils.
They usually roll right up past her eye lids.
Yeah.
Also up on gg.
Going to give it a bit of time.
A deep investment that one.
What about the new hitman?
It is not on linux?
It is split into episodes or do you mean the game has levels?
Life is strange soon.
Wow.
You do not take much time on decision.
s
You miss most of them.
The story with it's morals is a bit childish.
The gameplay is lacking.
Some time traveling puzzles.
Best played in 30 minute sessions I find.
Some puzzles I actually got stuck on.
But overall, 10/10.
This is a fritz reference.
Super obscure reference.
I would say 7.2/10.
Should only take 5 hours to do.
If you skip all the optional story dialogue, not so long.
I guess the game is better when you take your time and explore the world, even if the world is not perfect.
They all are.
Ah shit.
That was the video I asked you to resend.
Link me
I might be able to if he has quality options.
Watching.
ok
meter still running xom
Citizen's arrest?
hahahahaha
Hi.
Is this the laptop?
Change your nickname in settings to Mariam :D
Firesong
You can change it in settings.
Do you like my photo?
A pilot is a plane person, a pirate is a boat person.
The app is nice too.
I hope you love this.
Seems like a game that is not fun to play.
But some people are good role players.
xom
xom
Do you have a couple of minutes, like 40 seconds maybe.
Did you manage to get it and login?
Watching.
I was at toka's parents today and I went to the mosque for isha but there were 2+4+4+2+2+2+2+2 raqat.
It took two hours.
No quality options on past streams or highlights.
How do you feel now the exams are over?
Oh, I noticed there are way more matrix client and servers.
I just never scrolled down.
Did you die.
Her dad asked me to and I did not realise it would be so long.
Did you get the app yet?
Why not?
Which one?
Oh, me and toka started that this week.
You are gone for another 50 minutes.
Game of more interesting than paul.
I guess I watch it for the story now.
It reminds me exactly of british history.
And the accents are dire.
Also the make-up.
We are half way through season two.
Where are you?
Dire is always bad.
I fell.
Wake up.
I had a dream we arrived in dublin airport.
Your family were there and me and you were planning our trip north.
Wow.
You are a monster.
Also, thanks for telling me the deadline was last night after I fell asleep.
Okay.
It is not sold near.
Yeah, perhaps not, I have to send a letter in the post.
Because you have to to register by proxy.
No I need to sign it.
It may be sold in super markets but it melts so quickly.
Wow I forgot about the wand.
What the hell.
We just finished season two.
Buy ice?
No ice survives outside.
We freeze water and melt in the room, then refreeze.
Well, no, we drink it when it turns to water.
Still no water, at 10pm.
Where are you.
Still no water at midnight.
Doing that too.
Although, cheap is not the issue, it is more the speed at which we can freeze water.
Opened the windows at 33c because the air outside felt colder.
15th of July for monster hunter x.
Also 99p will get me 40 pieces of falafel. 
More than enough to feed 5 hungry children for a night.
99p also gets me about 100kWh
Probably not, local made food is much cheaper than packaged.
And there is no local ice.
I think an ice seller travels around providing to restaurants. 
And packaged ice, that would melt in transit and become a lump.
Everyone just makes ice in their freezer.
Maybe a truck that goes around burning petrol to produce ice.
That might be profitable. 
99p will get you about 10L of petrol.
Some place is playing fucking war drums outside.
It is 31c at 1am.
What I can not stand most is feral kids shouting and kicking footballs at cars and buildings all night.
And smashing glasses during the day.
Their parents must be feral too.
Some parents really need to beat their children.
No, some parents need you to hold their children.
xom
A guy with some loud ass electric drill at 2am.
Finally.
Okay now change your nickname to Mariam.
We are watching game of thrones.
Arya is the best.
And tyrion lannister. 
A few more I guess.
I will go to bed.
I am here.
Oh and the group with the youngest stark boy.
Where are you.
Do you like this and the app to?
Not as pretty as the tywell queen.
I am so glad you think it is better.
Robb stark is not hot though.
Yes.
But she has android so it works in the app.
I thought she was in tomintoul until Friday.
Drop poppy off? Was she in Tomintoul?
Maybe she meant Friday was the next time she will be free at home.
Yes.
I am at toka's friend's with ac watching season 3.
Richest home I have ever been in.
I can not come over laptops.
Leave it on 24/7 and see how long it lasts.
I am just glad arya is alive.
Robb just died.
Heat is always a laptop's killer.
Always the motherboard or power circuitary.
900gbp is insane for a computer.
I would rather have 45 rpis.
No way.
Base nuc I think 450-500 I would max at.
Unless I am rich.
Then I will pay any price.
I never need mobile.
I have a phone for communication like this.
Everything else can wait until I am home.
A job should supply the tools I need to produce.
I am okay. Love you too.
paste the output here.
or 14.9GB.
`sudo chown -R toka:toka /mnt`
`sudo pcmanfm /mnt`
Fat does not have owners.
Oh no.
And I wrote the register function server side.
Right I am done for today.
What is going on.
Which school's fence?
Will you bring mega noodles.
Oh it is fat.
A bit bored.
I am using ListAdapters now.
Yeah, logout and back in.
incense sticks
I am home.
Kareem came over for a bit.
Are you home now.
sudo apt install golang
It will not apply the changes until you (log out and in again) or just restart to be safe.
It may not exist, but create it.
If you are in vim, yes.
Wow.
I tried watching that when it came out but I failed.
We are watching Metropolis.
And it was just fixed.
Nothing means success.
Fooooood time.
When are you home.
Not really.
I do not think so, just waiting for work to finish.
Which two hours?
Microbus from traffic lights to Alf Maskan, get off at school corner, walk.
I can come down when you think you are here.
When are you home?
How soon.
pub global activate protoc_plugin
make
`nano ~/.bash_profile`
nano is ctrl+x, y, enter.
I added a splash screen and saved the token to a shared preference.
On the splash screen if there is a token, it registers it with the auth service. It says hello to the server, if the token fails validation, it goes to the login screen.
`pcmanfm /mnt`
It is fine.
Just the morning one.
I do not even recognise Nada.
I can show you on a map.
Oh this is late.
He will come over after work for a bit.
125
You found a bus?
`.bash/-profile`
sudo apt install make
So I will be home in about 40 minutes.
You should try to make one, and try to become it.
You need to sign it.
Hi.
You are finished you should be here.
Good morning.
How are you ?
A bit bored right now.
I probably need some coffee.
How would kareem get from around magdsoft to ours by microbus?
Every other client logs you out automatically when your token becomes invalid.
When we meet, I would never take a call.
Wait until that finishes first.
Wake up.
`sudo fdisk -l`
I have a postgres table running for libero.
Wake up.
:/
The end point is where you would get off.
You will have to leave at about 10pm.
My galaxy s is a trooper.
I have one or two.
It is in between a pharmacy and a supermarket.
Are you lost?
I focus on people in real life first.
Baby.
Baaaby.
so `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt`
It is flash player.
Not yet.
Postgresql can have listeners with notification channels.
Wow.
Using it now.
Every laptop I had died quickly.
My friend had a thinkpad and it died but it was old.
Yes, a thinkpad with an e3 would be a tank.
Yes, they have their use cases.
I just hate them because keyboards, small screens, touchpads, and all mine were fragile.
I thought you were free on the sixth.
Salma.
I will be home late :(
And my nuc has been on pretty much 24/7 since I got it. Server too. No hardware faults so far.
My laptops were on about ten hours a day and never lasted more than a year.
Three of them.
Actually, three fans in the server have died.
And the power supply made a weird noise so I changed it.
It worked but it scared me.
I am just next to the arabiata you like in korba.
7 I think.
I am on my way home.
Will you be here all the time?
I am home.
I think the server has a 73 day uptime now.
Might be going for a record.
Just have to make sure not to sudo reboot by accident.
Shit.
I will hack you and sabotage it.
Hello Mariam not a machine.
When I mention your name.
I have fool.
We finished season 3.
I am just glad arya is still alive.
It is much cooler tonight.
I wanted to start but toka fell asleep when we got back.
I have not, it relates to britain in almost every way.
But with all the wrong accents.
The romans conquered england, and build a giant wall to block scotland off because the people were too barbaric. 
Everything about it is a historical british tale.
With changed place names and people.
It is the accents that ruin everything for me.
There is a film called The Witch.
They taught their actors how to use the correct accents of the time.
No, these are modern british accents.
Almost every single one is from england.
I think the red woman is not.
And all the 20 year olds look and sound like they are straight out of acting school / a british soap opera.
People did not speak English in these times, they spoke Old English, then french / english, then middle english.
Okay that is all I will send.
Did you finish sohor yet?
I slept at three.
And I just woke uo.
I thought you could but it had that graphics bug.
No.
I am.
Season 4.
4-5
I am catching up too slowely.
I might.
What are you on?
That is.
I would prefer 1 though.
wly
But I can not get to season 6 first.
The black watch attacked caster's hut and burnt it down.
Hey.
Log in with lost.host
Actually, it should still work.
I have not tested it, but I was about to panic and think you would get disconnected.
Yeah, if you ever need to log in again.
Oh, and if you ever want a private chat, you can make a new room, invite me, chat, then delete the room.
I think.
A room which you delete the history after.
Wake up.
I will get into bed.
My eyes are heavy.
No.
You are meant to talk to me while I fall.
Does it involve knives?
Does she have honour?
A nude way?
Oi, why is mummy not here?
Wake up.
Holy shit.
She has a hover car?
Hoovering. 
I never played any of them.
Same with yoshi.
Is it death?
Set her up.
I think she already has the app.
Yeah, just log out and make one on the correct server.
Hmmm.
Try anyway.
Her real email.
Lost.host as the homeserver.
Try logging in then.
Maybe she made two accounts.
It worked?
Just add me to a room then.
Hey.
Okay, just go to settings and set your nickname to Charlotte.
I am going to stop the xmpp server now.
Daddy is the only one left on it. I told him about vector five days ago but I have had no reply.
Yes.
When you see him next, you can do that with him.
It is what I use.
Or mummy.
You are not everyone's mummy though.
I saw.
Side bar, settings.
Wow.
Was that you?
On purpose?
That is not your name.
Wow.
I guess it sells a lot.
It is vegan?
Names have capitals.
More than 1gbp?
vitalite is usually always 1.
I stopped the xmpp server today.
Long live matrix.
Soon there will be I Can't believe It's Not Margarine.
Think it is worth stopping the mumble server?
I assume by the time we need a three person chat this will have group audio.
The xmpp server stopped today.
And the ssl certificate was changed today.
Had to renew but I wanted to to be a little more restrictive.
No.
There are plenty of group call webrtc demos.
Then I should be down to just imap, smtp, minecraft, and matrix. Unless I forget something.
Ssh obviously.
Could you send me the apk for 0.3.over this?
0.3.1
I only knew apkmirror.
Seems to have the aame signing key.
Always a bit cautious of these sites.
Toka is going to Alexandria tomorrow so mc for sure.
Jesus.
Matrix is to vector as xmpp is to conversations.
The matrix server I use is called synapse.
The xmpp server I used was ejabberd.
I have no idea.
Hi.
I am home.
Come in.
Minecraft?
Say yes by calling.
Yeah.
But your name still starts with a lowercase letter.
Hmmmiii.
Will you send you here.
I finished the server stuff.
Python was being a bitch.
Hey.
:(
I think I have no photos at all.
I think I never sent our water glasses.
Downloading planet robobot.
Are there any online multiplayer 3ds games?
Just call whenever you are ready. I have all day.
Is it a shotgun umbrella?
Oh it is a card.
Do the teddies fit inside the card?
My face is bored.
I download them at night or while watching.
Maybe I sabotaged your internet so I could get to six first.
Me too.
But why?
Every chat app you can think of is based on xmpp.
But xmpp is awful.
Oh.
That is super weird.
Wake up.
Mc before 40 minutes.
Then find a transcript of the screenplay.
Yes.
This is why I found it funny. Cleverbot was more human like.
My cats.
With names.
They are nice colours.
Wake up wake up.
Good morning.
You like the ones were I smile.
Did you draw this too?
This is super good.
It is still super.
What are you doing?
Which food?
I had misa35a7a2 and fool.
There is only one kind of potato.
The bad kind.
Because toka is in alexandria.
Tested a world and it works.
Hey, I feel like staying up all night.
It has been forever since I did.
Take some coffee and stop wasting time.
XDG Dirs
Unity games do not start for me if I do not have the xdg directories defined.
Pulse breaks everything.
Thankfully I do not have it installed.
I do not have pulselib.
Not even sure I can install steam because I build everything without 32bit support.
For purity.
Seems to be no steam package here.
It will be in an overlay.
But eww overlays.
(3rd party build repos)
Steam is closed source?
They use no gpl libraries or code in their runtime...?
Additionally, 
But fuck all of that.
Yeah.
Top list is 64bit, bottom 32.
Also, minecraft?
Got the menu up waiting.
treehouse?
What is expected?
sun/moon footage,
?
Going to make some dinner.
Are you done for the night?
Managed to get an enderquarry.
We need to mine for some special ore to make dimlets.
Smashed 7k bottles to get the silk touch and speed upgrade 3 blocks.
Where did you go?
By accident.
Hot.
We finished season 4.
What...
Still?
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
It is starting.
I set the quarry to a square with corners 13,13 and 10000,10000
Wow.
3.14?
No, the new dimension.
How much draconium and dimensional ore do we have?
Where are you?
Beau left the day after I said he was the only one that stayed since the beginning. 
The first cockroach I have seen and killed.
No slow down.
It would be pretty cool to have a mod that takes a screenshot top down of the world at intervals.
You could write a script that grabs the latest screenshot and sets it as your desktop background.
Ran out of heap again with 4GiB allocated.
Changed it to 8GiB but 4 seems like a leak.
I think that means it is using 3.8G
No, why?
Yeah.
Toka made pasta.
I made pasta last night.
But toka was in alexandria.
Never.
Saying hello to a friend.
Yeah, mostly just pasta.
I joke.
I am not hear right now though.
We can speak later.
Forget the muliple lines.
This client does not support multi line messages so I could not see that I pasted it more than once.
I feel like this is a memory leak.
I think it is because the enderquarry is generating terrain.
But still, why would it not free that memory?
Major update to corsixth
Wow.
Wonder where he went.
Someone moved in to my town.
Checking who.
A purple pig.
Gala.
Big pink cow?
Mariam.
Hi.
Maybe.
When is late?
I woke up at 2 today.
:(
Breaking teeth is the worst.
Once you faint, you learn how to control it next time.
As soon as you feel it you need to get down low.
Assume you will fall.
People look at me weird when I am about to faint and I get down on my hands and knees.
But I fell and my eye hit a pole.
So I will never make that mistake again.
It was in scotland.
I learnt a long time ago.
Me too.
I mean, I get very close a lot, I am careful prevent fully going.
I am on 5 6
Toka keeps falling asleep.
I need to pee.
I went to bed.
I am now.
Wake up.
Good morning.
Monster hunter x tomorrow I think.
E7-8800 v4
Jesus.
8 cpus on one system.
8x24x2 threads.
Is it down again?
I watched it go up to 8500 but it did not crash.
I really want to play that game.
2.5 months roughly.
Assuming everything works out.
What?
Oh the gaming population.
I thought you meant the nx would have some death inducing vr tech or something.
I know.
Dedicated servers would be cool though.
Nintendo: "look super mario minecraft"
And mods, well, hopefully they are making an api.
What?
Only?
Not even windows phone.
I still do not get it.
Dedicated servers and mods for the mobile version only?
Because optional dedicated servers for the main version could not be a bad thing.
I thought it would be official servers.
Which would be cool because currency and a huge player base and a tanking server.
It is all for mobile though.
Which means they are working on the non-java version.
Which game?
Ah.
They bought it?
Or invited the dev because it is a windows game?
I always hated mobas.
Most boring game type I can imagine.
The new runescape card game looks good.
You are keeping me up to date with it.
Built a chroot system with 32bit libraries just for steam.
Not having all those files infect my system without being able to rm -rf it.
I have no idea.
This is going to be a long night.
Better than 8 though?
Yeah.
This will be the year of linux desktops.
Who are platinum games?
They are good games though.
A wide skill range.
Monster hunter felt slow to me.
Tomorrow is the release of monster hunter gen right?
Yeah, livestreamer-curses too.
Lets you save streams and checks to see if they are online.
Mariam is staying the night today.
No.
Nada is.
Do you know Rana Saqr?
Pretty chuft that steam runs in a chroot fine.
I can play some games without feeling like a 32 bit whore.
Namely EU4 and CK2.
Hi.
We are going to Alexandria tomorrow.
Early.
No where.
We come home at night.
Yes.
They are asleep.
I finished season 5.
Toka cried when Jon Snow died.
What?
No.
I have to wake up in five hours.
I should go now.
I.
Hi.
I cleaned the kitchen.
Is it for 3ds?
Refine I hope.
Ah I was out all day.
When is it out?
I am home.
We had fancy fateer with vegetables and mushrooms for iftar.
I am downloading, was going to watch it in 30 minutes.
The graphics look possible for a 3ds.
I mean xenoblade chronicles and monster hunter.
I could count the pixels on that video too.
I considered the pixel count.
I would have thought the nx would have much higher resolution.
Send me the video.
All I can find is some crappy new battle mode trailer.
It only shows the battle graphics and they look a little better than x.
Wow.
We are talking about different games.
xom
It looks good but as an open world, it looks a bit empty.
No news of the nx though?
Why are you?
What do you want to do?
Hi.
Did you get more colours?
Did you draw me something?
I only got 3.5 hours sleep last night.
I should.
Soon.
I went to alexandria and met Hazem.
I stabbed him in the back out of jealousy.
While muttering, "for the knights watch".
Once?
You have never visited the north?
I think I figured out what will happen.
The lord of the light will revive jon snow because lady misandre.
I only started thinking about this because you asked if you should spoil something after he died.
I knew nothing.
It is just a TV series though.
I am very hot.
That was a coincident.
Do not start me on the mistake of calling the virus the same as a low energy state.
And as someone who comes from the cold, everyone here believes the cold magically infects you.
As someone who has lived here, everyone has the worst hygiene.
People can carry viruses and not be affected by them.
They can still be contagious after symptoms stop.
The cold virus lives in and on humans. It dies when it has no host.
Moving on.
I have ice water.
I am too bored to sleep.
I ought to eat oat at its home.
ai,o'u,i',ou',a',i'shoum
Fast and unstressed this is all vowels.
Why are you.
Was it me.
Is it because I killed Hazem?
Is it because you have no photo on here and M stands for murdered lover?
Will you draw yourself.
It just got very windy.
I want to see how you see yourself.
I would rather not see anything else.
<3
We watched half of the first episode but toka fell asleep.
Tomorrow.
Good morning.
Jon snow is alive.
Vector is perfect, right?
Apart from chatting to an M instead of your face.
Are you bored tonight?
I am doing android development again.
What the fuck.
Hey come back.
The power keeps going out.
Wake up.
I am still here.
I got into bed.
How to write cursive latin script.
I do not like it.
I do not like writing.
It is ten times slower than my typing speed.
But writing is for communication.
We use words to communicate.
We use paintings to communicate.
But one takes a lot more effort to communicate the same thing.
Trying to communicate something in the style of words seems like painting a boat to make it float better.
I never liked calligraphy. I do like certain fonts.
I have made two fonts before.

Why are there 5928500 birds chirping?
Why are there dogs.
No.
I was in alexandria.
The north coast.
Wake up.
Wow.
Do you have an elevator?
I mean, it would be open source.
All games are java downloads.
It obviously will not be android.
Android is open source.
The monster that google ships is not.
Well, I have used android without google since paul@eternal.coffee.
I fucking hate google for what they are doing with android.
I am suprised the default apps even function.
I assume the only reason they are not closing up the source for most of android is it is all gpl.
I know linux is, and all the core tools are.
As long as the license is gpl compatible. 
Only if it wraps or includes.
They add code to the kernel under gpl v2, and the rest is apache.
They would not be able to ship any gpl code in it.
You need to provide sources for all the gpl code.
Linux is fucking huge.
Sure, but why would nintendo bother.
Also google own android.
They were not happy when samsung wanted to fork.
Something like if you want to ship your own market, you are not allowed any of our software.
So they were forced into tizen.
It is open source, I can go see all the code.
I can also download it and modify it.
And ship it.
But google are not so interested in furthering this development. 
They would rather build apks were they have no obligations to this license. 
I mean cyanogenmod is an example of that.
But they can not include google applications.
Yeah, they also abandoned xmpp.
Long live the matrix.
I read that the company pushing this standard wants to make a decentralized internet too.
In the sense that everything is a server.
The android app works fine.
I use the website for calls.
I use the website for 98% of the usage.
Never tried.
It is still in beta.
0.3.1
The ios app does not have calls yet.
Never had a crash with it.
The only fault is the service does not report new messages well enough.
I guess it is pretty hard without using google cloud push messaging.
Another thing google fucked open source over with.
I have it on three phones, galaxy s, htc one x, and a nexus 5 and I have never seen a crash.
Push only works because google runs a special service that runs on the phone and wakes the phone somehow.
Otherwise your service has zero control until it requests the phone to be woken.
And my messages are not going through google's servers.
Mariam.
Do you live in a penthouse?
Might do, you should hide it though, you should also not take it.
Take a cheap thing.
Not worth risking taking.
It will be of no use anyway.
Unless you want a humungous phone bill through.
Then it is not worth the risk.
Do you know how to claim for theft?
You need a theft report from the local police.
And then you get an iphone, not your iphone.
They can only block a sim, and then it is not exactly fool proof.
It is not worth the risk.
Enough of this.
It is very boring talking about this.
You clearly just want to convince me of changing my mind so you can have reassurance.
For someone who is so poor, you do not have the option of risking wealth.
Why would you take a video of a video?
Why not send the link to the video?
Yeah, I got that.
No.
Have you seen rick and morty?
Best tv series so far.
I remember seeing the same video for last year.
Just a stab at e3.
Like I said, the best tv series so far.
It is animated comedy.
Hi.
When will you make it to the 15th level?
Yeah.
That swimming game under the title of sony looked interesting.
Not with that attitude.
Here are my legs.
Here is a tiny door.
Here are the dishes.
Me too. I had two fateers.
Yes.
echo
Good morning.
I ran out of coffee yesterday but I am home now with more.
Watched the first, it was great.
Also the second.
What is breakout?
Did aya say hi?
Oh, my mum and sister and boyfriend and mum went to one of those.
Come to my house and try to break out.
Yes.
I am programming.
And I had coffee when when we got home at 11.
And I am Paul.
I love you too <3
Are you awake?
I am getting into bed.
Programming, eating, the like.
Lisa gone now?
Wake up mariam.
A planned visit?
Daddy has not been in a long time.
Hi.
Are you here?
What will you do?
Where will you go.
Oh, after they go out.
Toka went to some concert.
I am home programming.
WILL WE HANGOUT
Go to vector.im/beta on your laptop and I can call you here.
Or, if you want to use your phone... I will call as sam white.
Counting.
Hi.
No, could you hear me?
You have to allow chrome/firefox permission to access your microphone.
It pops up when you answer or make a call.
No.
Do what for the kids.
Corn flour.
I am still hungry.
Hi.
I got the rss reader to download, parse, save, and load feeds. It now displays your tumblr feed on cards with the images and titles and stuff.
A lot of progress considering I started making the app from scratch last night.
Joel Huenink - "I managed to do this without any programmers helping, which is always awesome."
7dtd dev
I finished the episode and had fateer.
Did you sleep.
Hi.
Wake up.
I am working on the app again.
Although, I wish you still had android so you could see my progress and tell me what to do next.
When did David Cameron decide he wanted to stay in the EU?
Never paid attention.
I better immigrate before I have my European license revoked.
This is the website he would use vector on.
Mariam.
Is he there?
He got xmpp using gajim before.
I think he might be confused and thinks gajim is vector.
Nah, 9 people is company.
9 people is too many.
Especially arabs who think it is okay for more than one person to speak at the same time.
Love you.
No drinking the shower water.
Ew.
IT solutions.
See if you can spot the new things.
There are 1000 things that do not work yet.
I should have fixed the new items not loading straight away after you refresh.
Also, the items should always be correctly time sorted.
And in case you did not notice before:
when adding tags, it gives you a drop down prediction of previous tags, which makes it very easy to tag things.
You can click feed posts and it loads the webpage and you can share this webpage with the share icon.
Also, I fixed all those mostly empty feed content bits below images.
Also super ew at internships.
They should be illegal.
Pay workers equally.
Give workers equal contracts and rights.
Eww.
Required internships for degrees is a waste of a degree.
Studying in university should be theoretical. It should all be knowledge.
I hate when the university courses cop out and send a student for a half year or year experience and count it as learning.
You will get that learning no matter what, after the degree, and you will be paid for it.
When you pay a university to teach you, I expect the university to teach me.
And I hate any company that offers "solutions".
I hate everything.
Ride to the fooooooooood?
Bring all the food.
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING TO LAY DOWN AND STARVE
Have you even left yet, or have you moved back in?
Yes.
Over night.
Toka brought home raw ta3meya, fool, grapes, soft bread, and tomatoes.
I want them too.
Hi.
It would bleed for me.
Belly button hair came out okay, but hurt the worst.
I think nipples, balls, and armpit would bleed if I epilated them.
Yeah, just shave them.
arms and legs are fine.
Yeah, shave them once a week.
Or stop shaving against the grain.
To thailand, I am sure you can.
Make sure not to be stolen and used as a sex slave.
Go in a pool? You are going to teach and volunteer. 
You are going to miss the referendum?
It is in 3 days now.
You should have proxied.
Wake up.

Shhhhh.
Oh I long for the day markdown replaces html.
ssssshhh
The man upstairs was just beating his wife and she was screaming for help.
We called the police and they said they are on the way.
Any knowledge you have here?
Yeah, not what should happen.
Domestic violence against women in not illegal here.
Neither is marital rape.
There is literally no laws on violence against women.
And it says anything is permissible in good faith of sharia law. 
Which is barbaric.
She was a broken person just screaming.
I think they have kids too.
We could hear her being hit.
If I went out that door, I would take a large knife.
At least the police are coming.
He is not prepared for a knife to the neck.
I have never seen her out of the house.
No english.
50% of men do here.
A real figure.
Not a guess.
If I ever see that guy he is getting pushed down the stairs.
She is a beaten wife.
That is her life.
I highly suspect she will deny all claims he hits her when the police come.
Otherwise she will be in much more danger.
She will if they ever arrive.
They do have children.
I remember.
Warn him I guess.
I think from googling, the police are starting to tackle the issue.
But still no laws against it yet.
What if we phone every time it happens?
Will the guy associate hitting her with the police knocking on the door.
Is this deterrent enough?
He sounds like the type of person that needs a quick removal from the planet.
No rehabilitation for him.
The police phoned for directions.
I know.
Just a quirk.
The important thing is the messages are all here.
Your clock could be a few seconds different to mine.
You better pack.
The scales.
They are still not here.
mmm
Sounds like it.
Think I should shit in a box and write an insult to him?
Not at her, though.
It is because there are no consequences that he thinks he can do it.
No. It will not go well.
Before he says a word or move I would have attacked him.
Lisa, this is an egyptian.
He has never heard of Scotland.
He knows there are no consequences.
He knows there never will be.
It is permitted by law to beat your wife and to rape her.
As long as islam stays islam, so will it.
I think the only thing that would have any consequences here is murder.
Their law enforcement it pathetic, and their law is non-existant.
Hungry and programming.
Did you see episode 9B
?
Wake up.
You woke up at 7pm.
Sophie shorter?
Lived on Gordon street?
David Shorter's sister.
Or the Sophie in Kirsty's year?
Surprised either would remember me.
London accent?
Wow, is there a human behind that makeup?
Yeah.
Always thought that was a vicious relationship.
Every time I hear of someone having a baby it reminds me that life ends when you have a baby.
They were together 6 years ago.
He still looks 12.
I heard stuart got married.
And douglas wood lives with his wife in the Caribbean somewhere.
Ruthven.
I think Jack Summers might live in Australia.
And David Firth works as a programmer in Aberdeen maybe.
I have heard about these people maybe once since I left school.
Looks like he is dancing with his mum.
Last he told me his dad and mum moved out to iraq.
He looks the same though.
His dad was in some military force.
A guy at work told me.
He was in the year above me.
Still...?
His parents said he would go for a year after university to experience.
He started traveling around doing farm work.
I guess he failed his parents ambitions.
Why?
Wow.
No.
Complain to isabelle about her.
I am awake.
I need coffee.
And Ice.
Mount and blade 2 was at e3?
Toka is womansoura often.
Sure, if you have mobile internet.
Wake up.
Wifi is not going to save you from killing yourself from the flight time.
How long is it?
Is it direct?
If not, how many stops and total travel time?
bendypauldron@outlook.com
bendypauldron@gmail.com
I thought it uses your device identifier too though.
I would think so because you need to put in your flight number too?
On the plane?
Yeah me too.
Yeah, they usually have all the lastest stuff.
Hello.
That is good.
Now you can stop being sad.
You woke up at midnight?
Hello.
Are you home yet?
To stay cool.
Staying up tonight to see the final result.
Does not affect me too much as I plan to move to Ireland and within two years. But as an observer, the bad result is the more interesting. 
I assume you are up to date with internet comment etiquette.
Why would I go to NI?
The UK and Ireland have a special relationship for movement of citizens.
Stronger than eu movement rights.
I will see you in war.
xom
I hate that the polling stations are only required to supply pencils.
Just use fucking pens.
Pens are more common.
Agreed.
Might be a little hard to count when everything is white though.
That does not help, a hole is transparent.
I imagine they are all bundled together.
xom
Someone who secretly eats the votes they do not like.
Do you think any regions in scotland will have a majority voting to leave?
Aberdeen rural areas maybe.
Moray is too english.
And the borders.
-s
Why?
Scottish conservatives are planning to dissociate with the conservative party under a leave vote?
I heard something like this.
I just can not see the Scottish people putting up with a leave vote.
I would say most Scottish people feel more European/Scottish than British
Having worked with people which 90% of declared they were voting to leave the uk, I feel like a lot of them just said so to stop people annoying them.
Even the most conservative of people eventually just said they were voting to leave.
And I am pretty sure they were lying.
Remember when we bullied Emily for being religious?
Good times.
Ten more minutes.
It will be an exact tie.
Might give updating synapse a go.
England will.
Well, if the Scottish independence polls and results say anything relevant, we should be pretty safe.
>> leave voters pussy out.
What the fuck is that?
No one, I see no quotes.
I see two grey vertical bars and grey text.

[Click here](lemonparty.org)
Goodbye uk.
Anyway, turns out vector (web and mobile) support markdown.
Just glad I have a ` key.
Watching a direct democracy is much more fun than a representative.
I think instead of the Scottish referendum for independence, it should have been a Scottish referendum to kick out Wales, NI, and England from the UK.
Wow, reminds me of USA news stations.
Jesus that first result.
Gibraltar 95.9%
Bit fucking close eh?
Moray    Remain 24,111 (50.12%)    Leave 23,992 (49.88%) 
Well, I am just fucking glad we were not the only blue region in scotland.
Are you watching these results?

What the fuck is this.
GG
The end of the uk.
Live.
Thank the gods, a clean map of Scotland.
No.
Ni in.
Prepare to witness the break up of the uk.
We will not have to.
This is the end of the Uk.
I watched the whole thing.
A few months hopefully.
Just the UK's.
Mariam.
Are you fine.Where are you.What are you doing. 
Cleaning the kitchen, eating mashy, eating ice, programming.
I Carrefour you.
I got into bed.
My back hurt all today.
Toka has been sleeping on the couch for the last two weeks.
It is too hot.
We have a fan running 247.
I got into bed.
My back is a bit better.
Where are you.
Good morning.
What is your drinking schedule?
Sounds like the entire uk government is crumbling.
It is pretty great to watch.
I have seen reports of this, but the only poll I have seen of that was 92% stand by, 1% regret, and 7% don't know.
I love how the eu parliament hard lined them, and told the uk to enact the article straight away.
"If you are going to leave, fuck off"
Oh, yeah, I mean half of the conservatives did.
But that is all.
And Nicola Stugeon is being hailed queen of the north.
in
Well no shit, but she is getting loads of support from everyone.
And the speech she did with the eu flag on her right, and scottish on her left, with the news banner "David Cameron resigns"
There is a 3 million signature petition for a revote xom.
So many of the signatures are fraudulent though.
Are you following what is going on in the shadow cabinet? 
Go on.
Looks like people have planted green things in desert.
Looks really weird and unatural. 
ancap?
Grand canyon, wow.
Xom
Has he actually resigned?
I remember waking up to the sound of his speech were he said he would stay as leader for the next few months.
To ensure stability.
Sounded like he was reading a script.
Factor 50, more like article 50.
Ignore the number, look for the uva and uvb ratings.
The number means fuck all.
Up to 5 I think.
Okay so
spf 2 gives 50% uvb protection.
spf 15 gives 93%
spf 30 gives 97%
spf 50 gives 98%
spf 100 gives 99%
But 95% of UV is uva
uva ratings in the uk are from 0 to 5 stars.
When you currently buy sunscreen containing UVA protection in the UK you may notice a UVA star rating on the packaging. The stars range from 0 to 5 and indicate the percentage of UVA radiation absorbed by the sunscreen in comparison to UVB, in other words the ratio between the level of protection afforded by the UVA protection and the UVB protection.
 A sunscreen with an SPF of 30 and a UVA rating of 4 or 5 stars is generally considered as a good standard of sun protection in addition to shade and clothing.
Studies have found that most people apply less than half of the amount required to provide the level of protection indicated on the packaging. Areas such as the back and sides of the neck, temples and ears are commonly missed, so you need to apply it generously and be careful not to miss patches.
When do you drink your three cups of coffee a day?
The only reason I do not drink more is because I forget or am too lazy and then it is late.
I consider 8 hours before sleep to be the cut off point.
If I have two in a day, I try to space them evenly.
Not sure how our quantities compare though.
Hi.
Will you send you.
This is very colourful.
Did you send it reduced size?
Probably.
This is better.
Why do you not have a profile photo here?
It is good enough.
You are always better than just M.
I always am up.
5-6am I sleep.
I wake up 10-12.
I do not sleep much.
It is too noisy and hot.
Too much programming to do.
No air conditioning.
They are expensive.
And loud.
And cold.
I am getting into bed.
The noise.
I do no not want to talk about how many people dogs cats and children I would shoot.
No.
Single glazed shitty windows.
Children who would be better humans if raised by dogs.
Abused dogs non stop barking.
Wifes screaming for help.
Cats squealing for hours in gang fights.
Car alarms constantly going off because feral children.
I would take a machine gun and mow these people down.
And 10x the population density with zero thought to building design.
And parents who breed children because they are shit.
I can not wait to leave.
And people watching football on the street all night with all the tvs on full blast.
This is not society.
Hopefully not.
Visa appointment in two weeks now.
I am downloading now.
It is just for toka to hand in the documents
Two weeks after that.
Yeah, I think it is because ramadan.
Hi.
Wake up.
How are you?
I have not seen it yet.
Toka is watching it with her friends.
So I will watch it with some pasta after I cook pasta.
I am okay.
No you are.
I am cooking the past now.
Iceland beat england?
Hahahaha
Watching now so no comments.
But I am so glad cersei blew up everyone.
Factorio 0.13
The second is the video directly.
I am awake.
Yes.
I am against all animal captivity. Bar things like the Edam Project. There is just not enough money in animal captivity to replicate their natural environments.
Nature reserves are good.
Spinach stuff.
Landfill, searching items
Want to play a game?
Search for new mods in game.
Soon as in?
Cause I am shitting right now.
Tonight?
They apparently fixed the udp shitstain.
Going for a synapse update so this will disconnect for a bit.
Nah, too messy.
Downloading factorio so I should be ready whenever.
No, I need to finish dinner first.
I have it downloaded.
Awake,
?
I probably have my old world but we should look at the mods.
Just realised steam launches 12.35
I am.
I can not resize the download box so I can not see the eat.
eta
6m
4m
Hold on.
Did you not change clothes?
Who is Merna.
I am good but I am hot.
I downloaded the a song of ice and fire books.
I am not waiting a year to know what happens next.
No, the first book is called Game of Thrones.
All the seasons are in the first book.
It is weird because reading it seems almost exactly like the show, but worse because it is not visual.
And slightly better because I do not have to hear the accents, and it uses better writing.
Pretty sure.
Do you want me to check?
Hmmm.
It is not just the first book.
The first book seems like 4 seasons maybe.
No wait.
More.
Okay the start of the forth book is pate studying in old town to become a grand maester. 
Sam
I just spoilt some stuff for myself.
I noticed the events are a bit different.
Will you read them?
Even without piano music.
I am not.
That seems like a spoiler.
Ah, season 6 is the latest book.
But it gets messy and mixed up.
Tywin dies in book 4 I think.
I think so because differences.
I. Hate. Dogs.
They never stop barking.
It is your job to talk about something else when I mention dogs.
I bedded.
You were in my dream.
I do not remember how anymore.
I should be good in about half an hour.
Wake up.
Not quite.
Waiting for toka to leave.
I mean leave to work.
You have been together longer.
And I would wish no one to go out in this heat.
Hello>
We would build a sound proof room with only piano music inside.
?
I think so.
Factorio is fine though.
I like having no things to tidy.
Give me 1000000 reasons.
Still?
Ah, just realised I can switch to my layout.
Coal is an issue here.
Feeling the lag?
Preferable over minecraft lag though.
That smog
*steam
Need to automate potions.
That is so hack.
We should just set up a cog factory and do it proper.
Making the two electric drills for tin and stone.
Fuck solar.
250x green and red.
Need faster iron.
Hello.
Only two iron to a steel now.
Poop time.
Just my back.
I will be your roommate.
I will stop for now till I come back later.
Iftar is in two hours so I would say I would be back at 7:30 bst but Egypt.
Why would it?
My throat would hurt.
Would we ban phones.
I would.
I would live with any of my three friends.
No idea.
Played it for 30 hours.
Been two updates since then.
Hopefully some graphics issues fixed.
Complained to the devs about not giving opengl version requirements.
Nah.
Mini metro is good.
Yeah but not as replayable as lose mode.
kbps or kBps?
Ben you and toka.
Gary does not speak to me anymore.
Busy.
Hi.
I would send me but I have only worn clothes to go out.
I am now a nudist.
Yes.
Hmmmm.
The dream I had this morning that you were in, although I do not remember, I think I lived with you and it was happy.
Although, the other parts of the dream were very weird.
YOU HAVE A PHOTO
Pfffffft there are a few people.
But I will be leaving.
You should make sure you do not settle in Egypt.
It is awful.
Find a nice Irish Hazem and move there.
Actually, that does not work.
Find a nice Non-Irish, but European Hazem, and move to Ireland.
I know but I do not know how you could get to Ireland.
It would be near impossible.
I think you do not have the original of that photo.
It is not more, it is peace.
No one has manors or respect here.
No one has discipline. 
I just do not like that we will never be real life friends.
Even if we did meet once.
I do not like that we can not meet now and then, forever.
I wish I knew you a long long time ago.
I mean I wish we went to the same school or something.
You tell me what it would change.
Yes.
In Scotland, yes and no are Aye and Nay.
Ygritte from the free folk, she is from Aberdeen.
No.
Send a smaller version,
Did he not find it creepy you took a photo?
I want to see.
Yes. The entire video.
I want to see how creepy you both are.
"That does not look like Jon Snow."
I think it is nothing alike.
MAYBE I LOOK LIKE JON SNOW IN REAL LIFE
Obviously she is Scottish with that hair.
But she changed her accent.
Yeah, people in the north.
The speech of the president of ireland.
He has been spending too much time on r/celticunion
I can understand it spoken.
And writen.
I can not speak it though.
Did you sleep.
I did.
You are still awake.
You can tell by the way you use your walk.
You are a man's women.
You have no time to talk.
You may look the other way.
Whether you are a sister, or whether you are a father, you are stayin' awake, stayin' awake.
Ah ah ah, stayin' awake.
It will be KiB/s
Here is a quick tutorial:
For people to confuse k and Ki is okay because the difference is nothing.
But the difference between b and B is 8 times.
Our internet is only 206KiB/s
Nope.
64KiB/s is not enough to watch low quality youtube videos.
64kb/s is not enough to do anything.
64kb/s is around the speed of the first home modems.
Small photos are around 200-300KiB so they would take six seconds to load.
Big photos are around 3000KiB so good luck.
A pillow?
I will get into bed.
It almost looks scary.
Come back.
I did.
Wake up.
Free in an hour for the rest of the night.
How do you feel.
Hey, I only have a tiny tiny version of your profile photo.
Ready?
Update to 0.13.1?
Fixes crashes
There is a one man band outside
Ewww
Oh oh will you get it.
You are super smiling in it.
I started recording it.
This guy is playing brass and drums.
I would send it to you but your internet is dead.
Okay, I finished playing games with Ben.
You have my full attention. 
I need water and food.
I have grapes, come back.
I still have hot showers here.
And then what?
Hahahaha
Just completed zero time dilema in ten minutes.
The guys tosses a coin and give you a chance to all escape.
Otherwise only one survives.
I guessed correctly, a cut scene, credits.
I was put off.
I slept.
Only for two hours though.
I am almost finished my application.
It is allllmost perfect.
What happened to your other phone?
It is standard usb.
I am good today, bit of a headache though.
Will do.
I miss toast.
I have not had toast since ever.
I think no one in egypt has ever had a toaster.
Yeah, but no good bread, and no spread.
Did you look for the original version on your laptop?
Mariam, you should leave twitter. It is lame.
Why is it.
We completely rearranged the flat.
The living room.
We have the fan in this room.
Wake up.
We went to six chemists and finally found one with ear plugs.
Hopefully I sleep very well now.
You did it yourself?
Well that sounds a bit better.
You do not need wifi for this, but I hope you are not wasting money on mobile internet.
My body looked like that when I first came here.
Poachers are not ignorant.
They just do not care.
You can blame the rich people who have ivory fetishes. 
Wake up Mariam.
I updated the matrix server.
Now we have url previewing.
Okay, I updated synapse and got it working using the pip method so it should be trivial to update next time.
Url previewing is now a thing.
No need to go to the link, but that.
Hello woke up.
Hi.
I was watching a crime documentary with toka.
I am making cold brew coffee.
It is very hot.
Good morning.
I am fine.
I should make dibner soon.
What should I make?
Noooooooo.
Of course all the time.
You are smiling. Why are you smiling.
Is it a scan?
It looks scratched.
I am asleep.
Goodnight Mariak.
I hope you smile in the morning too.
Were are the girls?
Hi.
Probably at her dads and Tracy's all the time for free food.
Tomorrow I do not know.
Why are you soura again.
People are too loud.
I feel like I was woke up and I can not get back to sleep.
They are in large male groups and talking loud.
And people are setting of fireworks that sound more like car bombs.
Why are people even awake right now.
I hate everyone.
They block it all but not when the windows are open.
I woke up and shut them but now I can not sleep.
You can not see fireworks in the day time.
So they are really just bombs.
Why are you awake?
I will find a better profile photo for this.
I changed my mind.
But you can have this one.
And this one as a bonus.
I think you have seen them before but pffft.
Yes, they both are.
I am making misa3aa3a
Never too early.
Am I a qualified Egyptian yet?
The bread was mouldy because shop owners have no morals and would food poison someone to make a little more money.
I hate people.
This is an offense that would have your shop shut down and you can potentially go to prison for in the UK.
Why am I awake.
I want pineapple ice juice.
Did you fall.
Toka's nightie.
It is just the camera and mirror and things.
I am the same weight.
Really, if I take a sideways photo, it will look fat.
The camera is weird.
Yeah I just want my British breads spreads and hummus.
I drink tap water.
I miss Robinson's too.
You have only been away from them less than a week.
I went back to bed.
But now you must wake up.
I imagine Ireland is similar or better.
The bread we got from the shop yesterday was made a month ago an mouldy.
I could not believe it.
Never buying packaged bread again.
Not when bread is made fresh on every street.
The shop owner has no morals.
It is.
Thailand has a future.
The people of Egypt are going nowhere.
Thailand is not an absolute monarchy.
Wow.
Their government type is constitutional monarchy under a military junta.
Fuck them in the ass.
Jump the border to Vietnam before they junta you.
Do you know what a military junta is?
It is a military dictatorship.
The military are the government and their leader is a king.
Juntas have a history of fighting all their neighbours just because they are not them.
Not the people.
Egypt is a military junta. Not officially.
It takes balls to admit you have a military dictatorship.
Egypt pretend they have meaningful voting and parliament.
But the military rule and the president is military.
There was a military coup d'etat in the last revolution.
I hate everyone here.
They have no manors, no respect, no discipline.
Nah, Ireland.
Not as much as the cold.
Theresa May is going to be the next prime minister.
She is the woman responsible for introducing an 18,600 gbp salary requirement for non-EEA family members to join their spouse/parent.
Anyway, I hope she dies.
No stop.
You do not understand.
At all, apparently.
It is not important who toka is.
It only matters how rich I am.
You act like I have done nothing and know nothing about this very prominent issue in my life.
We are going to Ireland.
After a while we can go to the UK.
But only if I want to.
I do not need advice.
I have read all the law.
There are hundreds of pages. And I have read them.
I am acutely aware of immigration to the UK.
And she will never, under the current laws, get to the UK other than by an exploit.
Immigration officers are the kings and they follow their guides.
And they are hired to fuck immigrants.
Just stop.
It is the powder.
Oh I know real pineapple juice is way better.
But it is expensive and you have to keep buying it.
They are too small.
Still way more expensive than powder.
Did you get it?
Making pasta.
Is the book fun?
How did you take the photo with no hands.
Wake up.
I slept for ten hours.
Only five cities.
Oh wow eww long nails.
The longness is.
Go home.
Battle cats pop. Highly recommend it.
Come in.
Why is it so hot.
I can feel my eye lids sweat.
Me too.
Hey.
How is it without Lisa?
Yeah she has been speaking.
Going out now. Everything is fine.
The Nile.
A boat ride.
Wake up.
Hand in the application on Monday.
Yeah, still unsure.
Maybe cork.
Not many populated places.
Think I should be eligible for social housing so I will apply for that, along with housing benefit and unemployment benefit.
Because I am British, not European.
Yeah, there will be, but being in public housing is right and I want to be on the list.
Yeah.
Not looked into it much because outside is awful.
I forgot to make coffee.
What are you doing?
Did you paint my mouth?
What did you paint?
Of course.
It looks nice.
Painting was the art I could never do well.
I could do good oil pastel and pencil, okay pen and charcoal, rubbish paint.
Hmm back at home maybe.
I am not sure were all my stuff went.
Where
Wait, I will see them.
Ah, yes.
Which one is the best?
I am now.
Did you demo.
Wake up.
I will make coffee.
"My face is melting", is a phrase I invented to describe me.
I love WILD so much.
The first one in the playlist is good too.
Maryanne.
One different sound.
Hungry.
I have to sleep early today because we have to be in Zamelak at 10am tomorrow to submit the visa application.
I was.
The visa is submitted.
I was on a bus for about three hours.
Travelling is not the correct word.
Everyone in Egypt gets it wrong.
It is emigrate. 
And I can not say until she gets her visa result.
Yes.
I slept for a bit.
Reminds me, I need to cut my hair.
Are you awake?
I am so hot and so bored.
Toka is at a wedding thing.
Toka says that word sometimes.
More ka7k.
And I just think more cock.
Hmmm I might have had it.
I would need to see it.
Esperanto.
Ah, I had some of those but they are probably eww.
I do not know.
Yes.
Why?
They break in your mouth into a powder and then suck your mouth dry.
I think I will make pasta.
Toka left her phone here so I have no idea when she will be home.
She will probably have food there.
Will I make pasta?
What will you do?
What is your matrix and vector review now?
It does not have a voice recorder yet though.
No.
It has the magical power of not needing to check if you got messages.
Which no other protocol can ensure.
I went back to bed.
I only slept four hours last night and had to get up at half eight.
I am doing Duolingo.
You were gone forever.
I woke up.
My sleep is broken.
I am not.
I did too yesterday.
So I went to a site for it.
And it was all lonely men and boys who leave as soon as you do not tell them you are female.
Which made me hate males.
I tried 30 odd times all with different messages.
So I decided Mariam is enough.
No, I do not remember.
<3
You are female though.
Everyone is looking for females to talk to.
These people will take any female.
I would like to show you what kind of people they are by having you watch me on it.
Ended conversation after ended conversation.
Being a female passes their test of char worthiness.
Which makes their intentions clear and it makes them sad.
Hey just talk to me.
I am your stranger.
I do not remember the beginning.
I think I will not go back to bed.
"Cold"
I am sure I did better things.
Yeah.
The phone needs to charge a bit so I might be slower at replying.
I am laying next to the window playing a game to be cool.
Is it not early for you to fall.
You should message me as soon as you are up to see if I am still up.
Yesterday I fell at 4:30 and woke up at 8:30.
Okay.
Okay I will rush over here.
Goodnight Mariak.
**Shave
Wake up.
I watched some but never looked into good long series.
I like the mystery type.
Have not played factorio.
You can start watching hentai and see if Kristy gets into that too.
I slept again.
Kristy watches hentai?
Is she into tentacle porn?
I will look it up.
Monster hunter generations soon.
Was waiting for gen so I could get into it.
Playing zero time dilemma right now.
And battle cats pop.
Not worth buying I would say.
Yeah, quite a bit.
Tetris, Bethesda, two worlds, oot
I think not.
It seems to be a running joke.
It looks so shit yet you praised it.
And on the lowest graphics.
Looks like an early might and magic game.
I remember you telling that story.
Is rimworld multiplayer yet?
I would imagine so.
It is funny because I have never met another person named Kristy.
I shaved my head and made vegetable soup.
I always do.
Ben what the fucking fuck.
Are you there?
Openrtc2 is basically ready.
And is has same park online multiplayer.
ae2 style same player I think.
I have multilib now.
It will.
Luckily, 32bit packages are not a thing on gentoo.
You compile a package with support for 32 bit.
So it is a single package and not duplicated.
No.
Just a handful of packages.
steam 
Yeah.
Same thing if I need static versions.
The only software that takes more than a moment to compile is llvm, gcc, firefox, thunderbird.
These are all cancer.
I mean, i use mailx but toka.
It can render everything firefox can because the html previews and stuff.
It is stupid.
Is the aur branch git?
There is an overlay for gentoo for the git version, I will get that.
I should be free when I wake up tomorrow to the evening.
But my face and head.
I am falling.
I forgot coffee.
These are the things I need to rebuild with a 32bit flag.
I also need sdl2 and sdl2-ttf with 32bit but I do not have them in the first place.
No.
Oh.
This time, I shaved it to be less hot.
No.
You did not go to my wedding.
Yes.
Because everyone hates me.
Only with my hair.
I am playing a game.
I just had fateer
I am laying naked at the massive open window to be cold.
I am now.
Why are you awake?
Did you sleep?
Because I was asleep?
Oh god.
Getting the data files is not going to be nice.
Fewer for you than me.
I have 200KiB/s internet and the download for the data is 700MiB, and I have to build everything.
gg, gog version
I have to build wine to install the exe.
I could make a torrent for you, and you can just download it at 45KiB/s
It would take 4/5 hours.
Okay, well, make a torrent for me?
Yeah, you are right.
Too busy watching hentai.
I watched some of it but it did not hold my attention.
Me too but I was too lazy to send it.
Because I was sleepy?
This is not sex.
Hmmm foood.
YOU ARE MISSING BREAKING BAD
I am going back to stealing all the internet then.
Shhhhhh
Hello.
xom
Are you hot?
I am constantly cooking.
What are your nightmares about?
Mariam.
No.
Toka went to bed.
I think not.
We video chatted once for a few minutes when I was in the kitchen.
I think.
Maybe not.
Maybe I have never seen a video of you.
I never remember yours.
I remember it was private.
If you send the link too.
I saw it.
Are you wearing make up?
Why are you speaking Arabic?
Tell them no one is home.
Yeah maybe.
I always see Amenah in you but you also look completely Mariam.
The face too.
Maybe I do not see enough of your face to tell.
I met Amenah.
What are you doing now?
Can you ignore the family easily?
I guess not.
I will have fool.
Are you hungry?
What did you have?
Uh oh.
Did you fall?
Not yet.
Holy shit, theresa may's speech outside her house.
She is a sociopath.
She must have been getting wet with that giant lie.
But maybe now.
Actually NO.
I heated up the soup and not yet.
I am not sleepy at all.
I am sweating so so much.
My neck and head are dripping.
I dipped my head under the tap.
Okay now is time.
I am not sleepy but toka might wake up and nag.
She is Mom from futurama.
Good morning.
I just woke up.
Will you have breakfast?
I want the ta3meya.
Yes but I am too lazy to cook it and toka will want some.
Do you see mould?
If not, they will be fine.
Make flap jacks.
Are you alive?
I did the dishes but no coffee yet.
What did you have?
Muslei?
Eww.
html
the fucking internet
chromium is over 9 million lines of code
What the fuck is wrong with people?
How do you make such a fucked up language set that it takes millions of lines of code to process into pixels.
Mariamiam
Hi.
I am.
Did the family leave yet?
Probably not.
Just computing.
I had fatah today.
I went to the kitchen and it was there.
Yeah. I have had it many times.
Of course.
I have had hundreds.
I am home.
In a dress?
Oh my.
You have to show me.
The turkish military are taking over the country by force right now.
You have to.
I mean I hate the current political party, but I also hate the military.
I want to hear their justification.
Because unless they plan on a dictatorship, you can not get much worse than the AKP.
Okay no more messages until I see you in a dress.
I can not imagine it even a tiny bit.
Why?
I know right.
I need to hear what the military group have to say.
It must be good.
There have been four military coups since 1960.
How while?
Come in.
You would think each government would learn a lesson and start diminishing the military.
All militaries do though.
How can you trust these political experts with all the weapons of the country?
Stalin could have taken down the military.
The turkish one.
As a child, I am sure he was fine.
Probably.
Maybe he hired bullies to kill everyone who got better marks in class.
xom
Wow.
I wish I made that pun.
It is!
But it is toooooo dark.
It is special.
Only if I see it brighter <3
Are you embarrassed to take a photo?
There are paper tissues on the floor.
Ask the sun nicely.
Hey! It was not the original.
It was only 151KiB.
Why did you take at one megapixel?
Why do you even have an iphone.
I still have the galaxy s.
It is not even scratched.
I was talking to people on Nada's phone today for an hour or so.
And I tried to find you but she does not have your number.
Did you escape the wedding?
Are you watching the cnn live stream?
Sounds like a football game.
Come back.
I feel quite okay so be here.
No taking off the dress until a bright photo!
Do you not talk to him all the time?
Degrees or years?
Eh.
Oh
Is it his family shit?
Because you have still been talking to me.
My face is melting.
No.
NO.
Awful decoration and style? Sure. Awful Mariam? No.
No, of the room.
I prefer the other one.
You smile in both.
I know you actually send me quite a few photos now.
But I still always want more.
What else do you have?
Is that Hla?
How did she get passed security?
What is that way?
Does she use them to tie up her hair?
No dairy.
I cooooooooould have fool.
With a piece of nice bread.
Well you know where it is.
I want to eat all the ka7k but toka would go crazy.
I got into bed.
Why are you awake.
Come back.
NUCs are outpacing me.
What is that DP?
DP over usb.
The UUID of my kindle is 0000-0003
Downloading monster hunter generations.
Toka woke me up before she left for work with ta3meya.
But I am sleeping again now.
Nada came over with her cousin to watch a crappy film.
There are too many people.
I decided they can watch it themselves.
So you should keep me company.
They speak too loud.
have been asleep too.
I am sleeping all day.
But it is hotter than the sun.
The cousin.
I want to make caramel popcorn.
Does hazem use vector?
Come in.
Why not vector?
What the hell.
There was me thinking she has her scripts written for her.
I guess this is why she should not do improv.
Telegram has a closed source server and an unsustainable centralised server model.
Xmpp was so successful because it was decentralised.
And today every chat service you see is xmpp.
All running their own servers.
Unfortunately, they lock their users to their own server.
Good morning.
They sound good.
Telegram was the promised open source, secure alternative to WhatsApp. But it never fully opened its source and it's security was quickly scrutinised.
Now they are playing awful music.
Where did you go.
Mariamriamri
Are you home now?
Hurry.
Are you wearing a sports dress?
Is it bright at the sports club?
I think I will wake up.
Did you sleep early?
Soon.
I slept again.
I am awake now.
No.
We went for a walk and found a very quiet park with a trampoline.
Never found soya spread here.
Did you make them?
Yeah.
Some kids watched us.
My body aches now.
How was your internship?
I can still do lots of flips on the trampoline.
Even though it has been seven years since I had a trampoline.
It was toka's first time on a trampoline.
No, I was home when I messaged you.
We used to have a trampoline and I would be on it everyday.
The sky is purple.
Come back.
I did not dream of it.
I did dream a massive dream but I forgot.
I think coop jam donuts are vegan.
How are you?
I wish I had soya spread.
Yeah but never found it.
That seems even more difficult.
Toka wears shoes in the shower.
Ewwwwwww
No why.
Html is the reason evil exists.
oh my god "D
Fine, back to facebook.
Here?
Why?
I rated the call 1/5 because I hate facebook.
Without faffing around with changing servers.
Toka is going out to a kareoke place.
No.
We should have a group chat with mummy.
I have never made a room before.
Everyone else did it.
I mean mummy is questionably meredith.
Not the firewoman one.
Have you been smoking weed again?
You are starting to look like granny.
That looks like linda.
Yeah, weed makes you sensitive to light.
Yeah, you do look like mummy.
I have always said that.
Look at a photo of him when he was 17.
No.
I am not going to ask for a gift.
Is it my keyboard?
Lisa can not tell the truth.
Half twelve is six.
You gain time.
Gain time to sleep in.
You get an extra eight hours or so.
Jeez, hour travel time is that long too.
our
Yeah, the same day.
All flight times are given in local time.
Your time of arrival on your iternary will give you the time in the uk on arrival.
No need to calculate things.
No, you gain six hours.
You experience 6 hours, then the clock goes back six and you experience them again.
Should be able to get 360mbps internet in Ireland.
Tell me when you are free.
Good night.
Hi.
I am in bed.
I could talk for hours about why html is bad.
But I will get stressed.
I heard they have changed a lot since release.
Yeah, saw that.
Might finally try it.
Yeah, it des.
I would like to see a review though.
Even a comment.
Hi.
Worth trying I would say.
Oh, you can rate without reviewing.
Still very sore from the trampoline.
It had been so long.
And it uses every muscle.
Good morning.
I am no longer on caffeine.
It took three days of concentrated hell.
Of course.
I have no idea.
I just do sometimes.
Come back.
Yeah I read it was hot yesterday.
Of course I mean, "hot".
The military for sure. Erdogan is going full hitler.
An islamic hilter.
Going to kill all the jews again.
Turkey is too busy seeing how many broom handles it can fit up its ass.
It seems to be tradition to teach muslims that isreal is satin.
Islam ensured it is.
Downloading Magicite now.
Stardew Valley has a beta on steam now.
Oh, I saw a game.
Something like ultra super mutant.
Looked fun.
With a crazy number of unlocks.
Super mutant alien assault.
No linux, and only local co-op.
What is this 2010?
I got rid of my 32bits.
No, have not set up newsbeuter since I got rid of thunderbird.
So I have missed the gg feed.
We should play all the multiplayer games.
I am so bored.
Yes.
But it is getting better now.
Yeah, I need a bit of a change.
Yeah, I thought ror.
Wow qbittorrent keeps crashing.
Why does the gog install offer to install some shitty software along side.
No.
I remember it was some adware level shit.
I got rid of steam because I heard the console program can download your games.
Downloading rtorrent to get magicite.
Some of them.
I only really use it for eu4.
What?
That always bored me.
I just wanted to crash all the time.
big rigs
rtorrent is working.
No idea, it is 25%.
Because drills and hammers.
86%
99%
Just making popcorn.
No idea where this downloaded to.
Nope.
Nope.
Not .local/share either.
Found it.
~
Eww unity.
It is from steam.
Says so on gg.
Are you alive today?
I made eggplant, soya, bell pepper and tomato sauce for rice.
I could not sleep.
I just came here to say that.
Damn. It looked like hammerwatch.
You have curly hair...?
No, still a few days.
Toka thinks you would show me but pffft you have no hair.
I never even imagined you had curly hair.
Or long.
Long hair is way more interesting I think.
4.3 in stable.
But it is gen8+
4.0 is coming to haswell soon.
Once those patches are merged.
But there was that work around to get it to work.
Egypt air will censor the word gay in your inflight movies.
And only serve you chicken and bread.
My mosquitoe bites go away after a day now.
I need olive ciabattas.
Who knows.
I never had any image of it.
I wish I saw it while it was long though.
I am drunk right now.
But hardly ever.
What do you want to know drunk?
That I am impeccable at typing?
Why do you ask?
Oh yeah, I told her that was super classy.
And it was sarcasm obviously.
Make them leave.
My phone is not receiving and messages.
It is still on the eggplant message.
Yeah, this makes no sense.
I write nothing though.
I write things to you.
Come back.
I think it is bed time.
Where did you go?
I want fool before I go to bed.
I woke up.
It is cold in the sky.
-40 or something.
<3
How are you still alive.
An actual cockroach or some other louse?
Because toka did not know the difference.
Cockroaches are pretty big.
Why is it so hot. I am dripping wet.
I thought I was the only person you spoke English to.
I am asleep.
Asp.net is also cancer.
No.
No update.
Come in.
What will you do today?
Will you look for that photo on your smashed led laptop?
My head hurts.
Did you go to the pool already?
Lisa home yet?
You left me.
I read something about making colonies.
Will you still message me though.
And where is the photo. I want to see the smile.
Why.
Is it the sports.
What are you doing there?
Rice and tuna pizza?
Toilet roll is the devil.
What did she say?
Terraria update.
Not sure if there is much new though.
Each time I played startbound it completely changed.
Come back.
Hi.
What did you do at the sports club?
Did you meet your zman?
What happened with your mother?
Come back.
I woke up.
Good morning.
Will you show me.
Arch?
I am trying to get Wayland working.
Never heard of that before.
What is your xinit file?
You should use ~ instead of $HOME
but that is not it.
And your .profile / .bash_login ?
Well yeah, git pull
Use sdiff
It is great, right?
sdiff -o output.h config_old.h config_new.h
Nah, then you need to patch.
sdiff will give you a nice output and you choose which side to keep with l(eft) and r(ight.
Then check the output.h file and cp it as the config.
Yeah.
Actually, I forgot how I updated.
Call it whatever.
I have no idea.
Just try it.
Later seems better.
Make config.def
New config changes are in def
.h is empty by default.
Yeah.
cat Makefile
the correct option will be there.
backup your config.h though
You updated your config.h?
I do.
Then try making.
fresh clone
Probably a patch that no longer works.
Gapless grid
Are you painting from something?
Or making it up?
Is this your nail?
Did you cut all the skin from the bottom of it?
Because that is very very creepy.
Nah, do it manually.
Or sdiff it.
sdiff is super handy.
I just install the default dmenu.
I do not customize it.
If you want to you can pass command line options to customize it.
 It gives a few lines for context.
The colours look nice.
Right was the new or old?
Empty means it does not exist.
Right is the second file you specified after the output.
So the last file.
If it is not important, go with the new.
What...?
Why did you cat them?
You should man sdiff
Only the differences.
It outputs a merged file.
When you select which differences you want to keep or discard.
Just never make the output file one of the input files.
Everything that is not needed.
If the new files has a blank, that option was removed.
file
Anything you do not care about changing from default...
This is the only issue.
You only need three colours to make them all.
Get a colour palette and the three primary colours.
Then just mix.
I feel like you really should have read the manual for sdiff three hours ago now.
That is the new file.
Yeah, you need white too.
Read about it?
They are right there at the end of the file.
I made ice tea.
Jesus.
Wayland.
Also you get to see my fabulous colour scheme for our chat.
It was random values and I stuck with it.
Now have to figure out how to write a keyboard layout with xkb.
So while it mostly worked, keyboard layout documentation is non-existent.
Some more of that game?
Good morning.
What will you do today?
Why?
No.
Too much fighting and crying.
Saw you playing it.
I woke up.
I fell asleep at 10pm and toka fell at 3am.
We switched roles for the night.
Fat?
Send a photo.
Not really fat.
Probably tomorrow.
Yeah bed head.
Slept for too long.
Going through Archer right now.
I assume you have seen it.
Is that my one?
I am on season four.
It builds a collection of references and running jokes.
No idea.
Baby sitting them.
Hi.
I did
But I am here.
Poppy looks bored.
I am very hot.
We made pizza.
Why are you sleep so early.
Yes, it is good.
sleepy
You have to be awake. Are you happy?
HEY
When do you expect to be?
From all the walks she has been on?
Why will it.
I am almost drunk.
Never heard of it.
On the gin.
Wake up.
Scotland is not too awful.
I am not awful.
Come back.
I am awake now.
Hi.
Not yet.
It had to get sent to Abu Dahbi in the UAE.
Which is shitty.
Outsource your immigration control, nice.
We are checking each morning.
Soon I think.
Shitty place.
It is a rich man's play ground.
Nice for the rich and shitty for the almost slaves who build it.
Good morning Mariam.
Are you happy yet?
Jeez, gg is accepting applications from the plebs.
The sky is purple.
No.
You should be more like Cersei and kill all your family.
Do not kill them though.
You have seen breaking bad?
I have.
I am watching the last seasons again with toka.
Yeah, basicially portable that connects to a tv with a dock.
Right?
Hello.
Me too.
As long as it is small enough.
Although, I do like dual screens now.
Not having two consoles would be good too.
All the games on one device.
xcx would have been a lot better with two screens.
I mostly played it on the gamepad.
Which needed two screens.
It was about 80% as good.
Nice to play in bed though.
How much faster?
My tegra in the htc one x has an overheating problem.
No officially a problem.
But it gets too damn hot.
Did you lose internet.
Oh god it looks like it is going to rape you.
And holy shit he is fat.
Mostly.
At least right now.
Chick pea water is an alternative to egg whites.
And no one is really that sure why.
Still, it tastes icky.
Well, yeah, but not in cooking.
Nothing right now.
I just had some tea.
I am here.
Which book?
What is it?
Well, if you want to hack your 2ds, today is the day.
Yep.
You just update.
Just follow The Guide.
You do not need any entry points once you install arm9hax
It takes control before anything nintendo does during boot.
Yes.
It is invincible.
Installs it own boot stuff.
They would have to exploit arm9hax to get rid of it.
They can update their software, but arm9hax loads their software.
The guide has become a little more simple since I did it.
But still, set a side a few hours.
This guide will work on New 3DS, Old 3DS, and 2DS in the EUR, JPN, or USA regions on firmware 11.0.0 or below.
I expect nintendo to patch very quickly though.
I do not know.
Free games is worth the risk.
And there should be no risk.
Does it play well?
I remember it but I feel like my computer could not handle it.
Even though it is old as fuck now.
I am reading the history of the russian revolution.
Because of the 12 free trips you owe me?
Will they grow back normal now?
Was it free?
Did your dad do it?
Did it hurt?
I miss you.
The usual times I think.
Although I have been sleeping a bit more the last few days and waking up around 2.
Tomorrow is toka's parent day.
It is too sticky.
I like it cut for me though. And I can eat it with a fork.
I will never forgive you for trading a shiny for a ponyta. I was so annoyed.
I saw the struggling to speak tweet and I laughed.
It was always about the shiniest.
<3
We have almost finished breaking bad.
Obviously.
It is the best.
I have no idea how it works.
I play real Pokemon on the 3ds.
Will you watch it with him?
I know.
Do you voice chat with him?
Or even video chat?
I would send more photos if I ever wore clothes.
Did we ever video chat?
No open ones?
Why are you so early?
No idea.
Is it important?
Check the date I sent you the money.
When you do so go to bed earlier because it is lonely.
Only some nights.
I might.
But then again toka will want to leave early so I should set an alarm.
Maybe.
Unless you are like Ben.
He is the only one who stayed long.
It is the last episode now.
Did you sleep.
Bank records.
I am hungry.
And I ran out of green tea.
Come back.
I am home.
Did you get cookies?
I had koshary.
Your father too?
And left you none?
Does he hate you?
But not as much as the cookies.
YOu paint a picture in my mind,You want to leave it all behind.
In a world that's turning all teh time
Nothing could stop me longing for your eyes.
I won't let it die.
I can't feel you when your not around.
Will you listen to drifting?
I had popcorn.
I am making a coffee.
What is molten cake?
Unbaked cake mixture?
Toka went out with her friend.
Maybe he wants a walk.
I have fool defrosted.
The chi wen to the su mar and bought a ted bear.
What do you have?
I have ice water
.
How are you?
Did you fall asleep.
I hope now.
not
Help waking up?
Stop having them.
I just woke up.
What did I do in it?
Hmmmmmmmmmm.
Just make up the story.
I bought bread and mint tooth paste, and more green tea.
Usually the market or the raw food shop or the shop below up.
us
I am not sure.
I stopped playing a game for the night.
I want to go to Ireland.
I want breakfast.
Yes.
I guess it will be ta3meya in the morning.
From who?
Is he not in the set of people who give good hugs?
WHAT MORE FROM HAZEM
My parents were real foster parents.
Yes.
They were not my foster parents.
Violetta, Liam, Caitlin, Charlie, Kiara.
These children mostly.
But there were many who stayed for less than half a year.
My mum also child minded Kirsty, Fionn, and another Caitlin.
I do not know.
Other foster carers / family members.
Well, they all had bad families.
We had seven main homes.
Then my dad had three after that.
I will be soon.
I will restart.
I am here.
Toka said she plans on becoming vegan.
Which I did not expect at all.
I am not sure they can do that without letting you out of the contract.
Unless it is the line rental changes for the year.
There is no water in the taps.
That is correct.
Where do you bump?
Yes.
I think my mum has turned vegan too.
But not officially.
She keeps sending me these complicated vegan recipes she makes.
Big place.
It is mainly ZeDoCaixao who is tanking the linux uploads.
I gave HOI4 a go.
It is pretty fun.
No idea how combat works yet though.
I have a basic idea of the rest.
You tell your son?
I saw this before but I might look into it now.
unprivileged package management grabs my attention
2 libre 4 me?
Iamchris4life
Okay breakfast time.
Hi.
I will shower.
I showered.
I think I need more tea and food.
And ice.
Hi.
All water here is bad, but at least it is safe.
You should send you.
You should always.
Where were you?
It tastes like chlorine.
And I have drank litres of it for half a year.
I would die if I had clothes on.
And when I go out, I tend not to take my phone.
Where were you hiding?
Where is that?
I will try to remember more often.
But also remind me more often.
I am so so hot.
And nice water.
I might be hungry but toka is asleep.
No.
I do not want to cook only a small amount.
Wait, toka is singing.
Yes, just knock when you get here.
Aparrently not sleeping.
She is not hungry.
Nah.
Hi.
Come back.
Good morning.
Wow, the broforce gog sh is a command line install.
Pretty interesting.
Have gog commented on that?
Playing it local multiplayer.
But the main menu is pure black and it uses so much cpu my mouse stops moving.
DRM-FREE. No activation or online connection required to play.
Is this not false advertising?
Crash on saving.
Minimum system requirements - Linux: Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 or newerProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo or faster Graphics: OpenGL 3.0 compliant video card Storage: 150 MB available space Memory: 8 GB RAM 
8GB
Are you sure the multiplayer has drm?
I have to restart my computer each time this game fails to launch.
They have a 32bit version.
For people without 8GB of ram.
400% cpu.
Solid
How much ram are you using?
free -h
What are you doing?
I am using 485M with one tab Vector, kde5, transmission, and two consoles.
Yeah, kde5.
I am running the chromium (technically).
Using QupZilla which uses QtWebEngine which is the chromium engine wrapped with qt stuff.
Yeah, open one tab with vector.
Just the browser, close everything else.
bar the terminal for free -h 
466M.
I am wondering why your usage is higher.
Probable steam.
y
Anyway, know of any good local multiplayer games?
3dscontroller works well with linux now.
First collection on the page xom.
It will.
I runs well on my computer.
That game is well optimized.
What did you have?
I had ta357meya.
And then pasta for dinner.
And popcorn later maybe.
Oh my god.
My sister just sent me this.
Also primary entry point in the latest firmware in the music player.
Today I think.
They had to check 8000 functions or something.
Just confirming, you know who it is?
David.
She did not take it.
She found it on the internet I guess.
Yeah it is.
I hope no one can find me on the internet.
He is looking fat.
I woke up.
My head hurts so much.
I need lots and lots of water.
Where are you.
Did you have breakfast?
Only.
Yeah, you could have ate four.
I have not had anything yet.
Where the hell is stardew valley on gg?
I put a 200GiB request on it to speed it up.
That makes no sense.
Sure, if the game was bad, launch hype would make sense, but the game is good.
I think repetitive with no challenge would reflect in reviews.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Where is that?
I need tea.
Just green tea, mint, a little sugar, and ice.
Hi.
Are you asleep.
Yeah, it crashes.
After the introduction and cut scenes.
Something about xna and steam.
Me too.
actually, it is crashing because of a missing save file.
Hmmm, might just start a new game and see if that fixes it.
You are running StardewValley.bin.x86_64?
It appears to have zero in game options
Just fucking cancer.
That is not a stack trace.
That has nothing to do with the stack.
Found someone with the error though.
Wait, I lied.
The game crashes on save. - Try running as administrator. Sometimes folder permissions can cause saving problems.
What a shitty person.
Might wait for the gog version to upload.
I think that was meant to be out two days ago.
It is writing the error logs just fine.
Same crash as root.
Are you home yet?
What do you want?
Did you run out again?
Imagine having no AC.
Nope.
Still waiting.
Waiting for a gog/hb release.
Yeah but I do not plan on being here in November.
Come back.
I am trying to learn how to program with haskell, but it is balls hard.
Way harder than assembly, I think.
I have lived with just mobile internet.
But it was faster than my actual internet.
No.
No one.
Do you know how to find the maximum prime factor of an integer in C?
Did you learn any C?
What did you learn?
How much is it from inverness to dublin?
I really want to know what you learnt.
Because finding primes is one of the most basic things you learn in any language.
I never felt any need to replay civ.
Well, you check for factors up to the square root of the number.
Oh it was just released on gog.
Tempted to buy it.
Gog version works flawlessly.
Time to get out the cocaine.
Do you know what happens if you stay up too late?
This game is the shit.
I see what you mean by one more day.
I could not stop last night.
Hello.
It lets me switch screen.
I only have 1 heart with a few people.
Next year.
Are you fine?
Some?
I am hot but I have ice tea.
I can not wait to get a horse and run around.
GiB
You said gigabit seconds.
Which makes no sense.
The plural of Gi(bi)B(yte) is Gi(bi)B(ytes)
No idea.
Hopefully.
Which novel?
I saw the stable upgrade and it says you can own and ride a horse.
Want to voice chat?
Later?
Oh wow.
Here.
No.
Probably half a billion people.
Fine I suppose.
It is a little too general.
Have you blocked your nose with a tissue plug?
It helps.
It is the only way I can sleep.
When I have the cold.
Completely block the nostrils.
Is it not blocked already?
What the hell.
I am at two hearts with three people.
What day are you on?
No spoilers.
Do not spoil.
Going for leah.
Which day?
I will eventually get 10 hearts with everyone :D
I am on the 5th of fall or something.
I got the kitchen.
And dungeon level 50.
I mean I played new leaf for 200 hours so I guess that is enough to marry everyone.
Even shane.
Yeah, a joke.
Why?
I thought on release they would be unavailable for a reason.
Pam.
Oh, Hayley.
I think she likes quinoa.
Good morning.
How are you.
SA e. uafsq
I am fine.
Wrong layout.
It is when I have qwerty on and forget and press enter without looking.
I use qwerty for games and typing now, I can still type about 70wpm in qwerty but it is stressfull.
Jsns al ,jek ak iddpl iaps ,jsf A kw/s ,akj asdf df jsnsq
Notice that qwerty puts all the worst letters in the best places.
Good morning Mariam.
I deleted it ages ago because everyone is different now.
Everyone's tweets are lame.
Well, I am hot.
Like always.
Progress?
Any animals? Levels? Dungeon? Completed any town hall sections? Total earnings? Date?
I highly recommend repairing the minecarts.
It's not, I just want to know what I can talk about.
Are you making a book?
You should delete it and be cool.
Have you found the major's pants yet?
Mariam.
I am going to make a website along the lines of: what should I do today?
And it will randomly pick one thing each day and display it in large text in the centre of the screen.
And you have to do it.
Toka and I are coming up with lists of things that could be there.
The things have to be productive, and things everyone can do.
Do you want to help with ideas?
We have two types, general ones, and list ones.
This is how a list one works.
A study one with "Take 15 minutes to study %s."
a draw one with "Try to draw %s."
Of the dungeon?
Where do you think they are?
I finished the dungeon, but I will not say how deep it is.
Where is the ranch house?
Marline's?
Think he is having sex with her?
He said he wanted them back discretely.
xom
Yeah they were.
Having a shit tonne of gold is nice.
Seriously, complete the room of quests in the town hall with the black smith room.
The one with three groups.
It is easy, and worth it.
Gold the metal.
I think there are more hidden points because another one of the groups says repairs mine carts.
I got the bridge.
I wonder about the shimmering rock.
And most people consider them unhygenic.
I changed the cake thing to "Bake %s."
Most people are going to pick a book in their house and then they would wonder why they are reading the middle and not where they last left it.
Maybe just, "read a book for 15 minutes"
A lot of people will not have a book they know nothing about.
And read a book can include any part of it.
I do not have a desktop.
And a lot of people might not have computers.
Since there is only one a day, I want it to be applicable for everyone with access to the internet.
And some people only have phones.
Yeah that is good.
Did you die?
Are you asking everyone?
Take a bath
Not everyone has a bath.
I can tell you most people in the uk only have showers.
Baths are too slow.
That is a bit too general.
No, I added that.
I mean the bad habit one.
If I spent 12 hours looking at the sky, I would kill myself.
I look at a computer screen an average of 10 hours I think.
Iffy because it takes a lot of time for a lot of people, but I will add it.
I am thinking of making a website.
It will be along the idea of: what should I do today?
And it will give in plain text one thing a day.
Something fairly short, easy, and productive, but also something everyone with access to the internet could do.
To give some examples:
Oh, I just need to find a good domain name I like and write all the pages.
Two that are avialable are one-thing.today and inmylife.today
Taken.
Also, it is not todos.
These are some we have come up with.
Do you guys have any ideas?
I need hundreds.
Because work, and swimming takes at least 1.5 hours.
Which is not time a lot of people will have if they have a family and work.
Did you set it on fire?
Shiiiiiiiiiiit.
I did it.
HELLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Mariam.
I literally spent since 3:37 today getting the internet working as before in scotland.
Only took me a fucking day.
I had potatoes for help in scotland.
Come in.
Maririamriam
Yep.
Oh Mariam.
<3
It must be super fine.
You can check domain names on namecheap.com if you really want to help.
What about didit.today?
But it is not a todo list.
And no sane person wants to put ()/s in a web address.
And it is not easy to say.
It has to be short.
And simple.
Just like the site.
Come in.
I am stuck in the bedroom while toka teaches.
I sent daddy the instructions to get vector.
Just waiting now.
They speak no English.
I cut my finger with a ruler.
I was trying to open this phone with it.
No napping now.
Now is celebrate vector time.
Mariiiiaaaaammmmm
Hi.
Wake up.
Are you fine awake?
I am.
Did you see toka and me piggy backing?
Will you send you?
Where did you get it from. I thought you had none.
I see a keyboard.
Oh this is not old.
Pretend you are snoring.
Yes.
But you will not be in Ireland.
I hope.
Any day now.
Hmmm, I do not know.
It is toka's parents' day tomorrow.
But ta3meya in the morning should keep me alive.
Why are these not in your book?
Why are these not in my mouth?
Why is this broken english?
Do you even like pokemon?
I still play it.
Why is there a cup on top of a book?
Currenly Pokemon X.
It is hard to read any text over that.
Oh, good, this is not what you learnt in school.
You forgot a capital C on class4.
Oh, we looked after a young kid who liked these, but I used to just make the most difficult structures from them.
Too much radio head.
Because you sent lots of pictures?
Fiiiiiiine.
Goodfnight Mariak.
Hi.
I did not sleep yet.
But I am home.
It occasional gets turned off for a few hours at night.
I barely use the phone but this is my screen.
Hello.
You slept, and I did not.
No idea.
It costs 0.028 pence for one cubic metre of water here.
Which is about the size of two baths.
Nothing yet.
I have no idea.
I had ta357meya and misa1a2a3.
Yes, I do.
I still have some more misah2(2? to eat.
I will eat the mi74563128 now.
Hmmmmm, I have no idea.
Not soon.
Xmpp was around 20 years and conversations is still only just getting it.
But you can record and send the file.
Oh wow, it lets me play the audio right here.
That is impressive.
Does it let you download it?
Well, if you really want to hear it you can look for it next time you use the laptop.
You make so many good drawings.
We got new spray but stuff for flies.
It is blue and I am excited to kill flies with it.
But where is my mouth?
I feel so tired.
I could go to bed and sleep in minutes.
Well, I wish.
Well, I am alone.
Out with some friends.
Okay I need ice.
A whole one?
Without showing me?
Why am I still awake.
I slept.
I slept again.
Hi.
Does this look worrying?
Last night.
I think a mosquito went crazy, I had four bites on my feet too.
They went down today.
Put some fungicide/bateriacide/blah on it.
Good morning.
No, I am fine.
Every weekday is teaching day.
So you have to promise to be here between roughly half seven and ten.
You feted bits?
Oh, beasty bites.
I wrote a script that detects when a "monitor" disconnects, and forces it to turn back on.
So I use 4k with everything scaled 2x now.
Nah, just uses xrandr.
It was not a powersaving problem, just the monitor being shitty.
while true; do    while [ $(xrandr | grep " connected" | wc -l) -lt 2 ]; do        xrandr --output DP-1-9 --off --output DP-1-8 --off        sleep 2        xrandr --output DP-1-8 --auto --right-of DP-1-9 --output DP-1-9 --auto    done    sleep 5done &
Just spams it until the monitor turns on.
Something to do with display port signals not sending after the screen has registered off.
I was suprised I could just brute force it back on.
You can actually see the pixels on the fonts at half a metre at 4k on 28inch.
Using sub pixel rendering.
So I doubt 4k is the last point.
Also, until we have enough pixels to stop using subpixel rendering, I hope it continues. 
No what?
5k without subpixel would appear to be similar to 4k with subpixel.
I imagine 8k at 32 would be decent.
Not yet.
It has only been two days or so.
MARIAM
It is time.
I am playing box boy.
And I have super strong mint green tea.
And my kindle.
This was my back last night.
The devil or something.
Oh, I do not check emails thaaat often right now.
And I never check hangout.
No emails to paul@lost.host?
Yeah, toka put some cream on it.
Now they are smaller.
I had four on the feet too.
Nah, I think I just scratched it too much before thinking about it.
Soon.
But you too.
Shh.
Wrong layout.
Come back.
I spent forever looking for those letters.
NO.
Hmmm, well, I think even toka is not asleep.
But usually around half five.
I guess you never logged out since I fixed not needing the port.
I did mention it though.
It took 3 or 4 days for the internet and new router to be set up.
But it has been online for three or four days too.
Good morning.
I literally just had it.
Yeah, better.
Yeah, not really.
They both contain fava beans, but that is where the similarity ends.
I mean, cake and bread both contain wheat flour.
Did you get No Man's Sky?
Lots of complaints about it but it still looks enjoyable just for the exploration.
Watching it, it looks like neither.
Purely exploration game.
Sure you collect resources and make your ship better, and you can trade, and fight.
But if you want to do any of those, play elite or something.
Yeah, all the reviews I saw were harsh.
But, I have watched three hours of it, and I still want to try it.
Also, everyone hates it because it uses console controls, and performs badly, and crashes.
It requires opengl 4.5, and sse4.1.
Which means anyone with phenom cpus can not play it.
But they did not say this.
The fov on ps4 is about 20.
Crashes on pc too.
The music is top notch too.
Hmm, I just installed windows.
After seeing the phoronix article with intel graphics on windows vs linux.
It was almost consistently 70% better on windows.
Was just thinking maybe elite dangerous.
How big is it?
Oh god.
I do want to play it though.
I will leave it downloading over a few nights.
I have it but the landing stuff looked a bit lame.
And you could not land on earth likes.
Not sure what they have changed since.
Should have been two updates since.
Is it on linux now?
I got windows and linux booting using an efi boot partion with systemd bootloader.
I really need a bigger ssd.
Windows was downloading using chrome at 25KiB/s.
I switched to linux to download the file and it was solid 200KiB/s.
I have no idea how they fuck up so much.
It is almost time.
Are you here.
Managed to convert Toka to my keyboard layout and to use DWM. She also mentioned that she plans on becoming vegan out of the blue.
So no more KDE.
Pfft, if libraries were not a shitshow.
The suckless team are making a c compiler now.
New version of st came out too.
The c compiler is called scc, it has pretty active development.
No idea why they are supporting c++ though.
Every weekday.
Are you everyday?
Is there more doc and strats on how to make mad dosh now?
Pretty hyped for it.
I never got the fucking asp.
I forgot everything.
Hmmmm.
I went to bed at 7 last night.
I was programming.
What did you do in the morning?
I hope it runs well.
Do you like your cousin?
Z-woman?
I think so.
Yeah, hoping they have got better.
Game might have got worse though.
What is her name?
I wish there were more stations.
You know a lot of radwas.
How old is she?
Is she noisy?
Like the island south of zamalek.
Is that were she lives?
Rawda island.
:(
What.
I have been there 15ish times.
I wonder about the lag on planets though.
I think it goes on sale.
Oh, it changed.
I never knew about the price.
Come in.
I just 100%ed boxboy.
Now for box box boy.
Not sure I will go for s rank.
Did you complete it?
Getting the last crown on the last level was harsh.
I have been about 30.
I am stuck in this room.
They are my age.
I do not want to interfere.
They are nervous enough.
Wow you get to use the costumes you unlocked in boxboy.
Did you try the ninja and the rabbit?
I played without the wizard, ninja and rabbit first to get the true puzzle. But they are fun to feel like you are breaking the puzzles.
Being the box emperor.
It was but this is a new class.
Toka made zuchini and pepper mashy.
But they have to leave first.
Are we copying?
Oh.
Food today.
Why?
I wash my hands about 10-15 times a day.
This is enough.
Laptops are not great for games.
You could try cookie clicker.
Right now.
Yeah, I am a nuc kid.
Getting a new one?
Well, cards are much lower power these days.
What was it about those new amds?
Were they good on linux?
And were they super tiny?
Pffft wait until I get my iris 580.
Still going to blow what I am used to out of the water.
I still have a hd 5000.
Which is haswell.
Who knows why they named it a 5.
Sometimes it is to stop shitty search results with older products.
Like windows 9.
Can not tab out of No Man's Sky.
Oh, no, it crashes in the startup video.
I have sse4.2, and opengl 4.3.
I applied a workaround to let 4.3 work, but it just crashes 5 seconds further in now.
The most popular thread on steam is 600 pages of game crashes on start.
Shitshow.
Just at 2.5GiB I was curious to know if it would run at all.
I think people hyped it too much.
Sure it was not ready.
Total Biscuit did a good review on it.
I think so.
I might be thinking of the wrong review.
But there are a lot of technical issues.
When your game crashes, you fucked up.
And on console, there are no log reports.
Beta test the fucking thing.
Qa can not account for the massive variation of hardware their market will have.
Yeah, that is crazy.
For sure.
But once I get used to it again.
I will switch to windows now and get it downloading.
Change of plan.
Toka is streaming stuff.
Overnight though.
Come in.
What are you doing?
The android vector updated with voice and video calling.
68m, but I remember nothing.
Oh, holy shit.
Going to give this patch a go.
I just want to see whether I get 4, or 5 frames a second.
Ewwwwwwwww.
4.4GiB of 15, last night.
So I guess two more days.
Eugh.
Wake up.
Nah, we can just voice chat when I get it.
Playing stardew valley.
Wait. This is all information for when I play it.
Eugh I have too long to wait.
Toka's save.
Any idea?
Did you read the letter in Lewis's room?
Gwent?
Put anti biotics on them but they are not blisters.
Just like.gigantic bite marks.
Not sure I like the sound of that.
Wake up.
Oh.
Toka restarts to linux when she gets up, but as long as the internet was fine last night, it should be about 66%.
Did it look easy to do?
Wow.
It could pave the way for stupidly big ships.
I would have thought you would have to hire people to man your lunchables.
It is was I read in "launchable fighters".
Yeah.
"I need truffle oil. Don't ask me why." - Lewis

I made 420,000 this summer.
I mean, any sex joke is pretty mild, and a kid would not understand.
Not sure what hayley was doing with the potato though.
I am not a girl.
I took an emergency stop on a brown dwarf.
And by brown dwarf, I mean your mother.
And by dwarf, I mean averaged sized person.
And by brown, I mean white.
And by emergency stop, I mean steaming pile of dung.
There are so many secrets I am discovering second year.
He is still quite an asshole.
More just always grumpy now.
Oh.
Is this spoilerish?
If he had to tone it down, I know that he is going to be dissapointed.
Well, now I know he scores you.
In my mind, he could have done anything.
He could have gave me a rainbow horse.
I was never going to play the game for a score.
Unless it unlocked autofeeders.
Which, if they exist, shh.
I am not assuming, but I am hoping.
I am not sure.
Yeah, true.
I remember there only being one big station type.
Did they add more?
MARIAM
Nope. It is the same company making all the vector applications, but different teams.
But hopefully soon.
I am fine.
Are you?
Maybe because she was forced to wear butterflies when she would rather be wielding swords.
Oh.
I know why this is.
My mum could not get a cable working so they used a different thing.
I might get her to try and switch to the other one when she is home from work.
Oh, I know why vector is acting up now and again.
It is because of the powerline adapter.
I have an idea about that other cable that I want to test, if you are home at any point.
It should not take too long to test.
But not tomorrow.
I do not want to rush you in your hour at home.
Okay.
Which one?
Mostly gone now.
Hopefully I will have it tomorrow.
No the anaconda.
Hello.
Not having a docking computer made me hate life.
Wake up.
I just caught lewis going into marnies house as she left, he went into her room, up to her drawers, stood there for ten minutes and left.
Clearly stealing panties.
Wow.
Abigale's room.
Her dresser.
It's full of clothes... wait. There is a sword hidden under the clothes.
Mariam.
It seems like the iOS app is bad at reconnecting.
Are they not letting you sleep?
I will soon.
 It is quiet for once.
I have never heard of genena mall.
Checked the percentage last night and it turns out it downloaded squat the night before.
Again, Toka restarts in the morning, but best case is 66% currently and finish tomorrow.
I have never heard of al batrawy street.
Morning.
I remember that situation with the asp.
Eugh.
Pffft charity.
I think they were when I played.
It was a part of power play?
Like the teams voted on the goals to expand into areas.
Oh, what are the goals?
Wow.
That would be cool. Then they would develop that system.
Must be personal.
Wow.
Brand new?
You are going to be my mentor.
Hopefully I have an asp.
Where do you spawn if you die?
Ah not too bad. It will be an adventure.
There are zero stations on the way?
Have you tried telling hla to deal with them?
It is time.
What does she do now?
Are you gone again.
I am a little sleepy.
My mum is going to message me when she is home from work.
I hope you have learnt that iOS is worse than usable.
I miss you too.
Yes.
But not for long.
It is bed time.
Are you fine?
Forgot to set the download last night.
Going out today so will set it now.
I am fine.
71%
Can not trust the connection not to drop to a lower speed.
What can you do?
Are they gone now?
Tonight will be the night.
Watching a movie.
Force majuere.
Hi.
It was good.
What are you doing?
Who were you talking to?
Who is mona and ahmed?
Are.
Why am I not the only one.
Am I not enough.
I am falling.
It was apparently finished.
But Toka is addicted to stardew valley.
I might play today, but tomorrow she is out so for sure tomorrow.
I am awakest.
For the run to the centre?
.6>zoX.+2t.`fC&(DGP%m"Lu-
Are you ready to not disconnect today?
I am going to be so lost tomorrow.
Mariam.
I think my mum comes home from work tomorrow.
Very hot.
I just did the dishes.
Yeah, my hands are still wet.
Wait, I will update the server.
Okay, I think it is updated.
Are you changing the homeserver url?
Screen shot it for me?
Is your username and password correct?
Wait.
Update your browser.
It is too old I think.
Is the padlock green?
That would be a fault of your ISP's nameservers.
Which windows version are you on,
?
I can tell you how to use google's nameservers instead of your isps.
Because your isp is clearly shit at running a nameserver.
Pretty easy tutorial.
Just if you use wireless, click the wireless network that is connected, not the 'ethernet' one in the tutorial.
Good morning.
Going to start it up after I get back from the market.
Toka is seriously addicted to stardew valley now.
She got up two hours early just to play it more.
13 minutes until the download is finished
Think I will get a steam controller or two for local multiplayer games.
1.5 minutes.
Call?
I can imagine.
I got a bit bored of fool after having too much.
Where did you think they were?
Hahahaha.
There is no Mariam in them.
The clothes are missing a mariam.
The clothes are empty.
Yeah they are taking forever.
Mariam.
Are you home?
Hello.
I will be gone for 15 minutes.
Hi.
Hot and a little sore.
I had noodles fateer fool and a date role.
Roll
What will you have.
Ow.
There never is any me.
Toka is the only person who takes photo of me and she tends to post them to instagram.
I mean, if you want a photo like, or a bigger unedited version of anything.
When I wake up on Wednesday, remind me.
Toka is away.
I am embarrassed to take photos of myself.
I can never do it with anyone around.
Bad.
I know but that is what I went with.
I always see people in public taking a photo of themselves and think wow lame.
So I would be afraid of people like me seeing me.
I also would not do it.
It is why I only buy healthly food in supermarkets.
Having a standard higher than yourself is a good way to improve.
I am kind of still hungry.
It is music time.
Now I feel very awake.
Hey.
Wake up.
I went to bed at 7:30.
1pm.
Are you ready to not disconnect today?
Me too.
Come in.
Okay.
Hi.
The sequel to human revolution is out, maybe?
Hi.
Remember to remind me.
I might wake up very late though.
There are very few types though.
Hi.
I started learning.
int, string, float, boolean
It has uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, float32, float64, etc.
Which is great.
But if you want those, you have to use explicit.
The for loop, with range, and other stuff is great.
And the switch case notation is great.
tour.golang.org
Well, for does not exist in the processor.
loop does, but no one uses it.
The structure of the while loop is exactly what the processor does.
Slices are cool.
Make using pointers pretty redundant.
Also, built in maps are appreciated. 
Once I started writing, I never even thought of typing a semicolon or parenthasis. 
Came pretty naturally since the formatting and style is strict.
You have go tool format 
You can put the parenthesis in if you want, I suppose.
Pretty sure.
They are just optional.
No, you can not.
The parser is pretty strict.
You can in if else statements though.
Not in for.
Wow.
Wow.
How does code work?
Was going to point out that it looks nothing like python.
Hmmm.
Nah, c looks so simple.
Also, no gcc or clang.
Or libc.
Have you seen the go libraries?
Yeah, but why would you use it.
The stuff in the line is evaluated at the time the line is read.
I think they believe in garbage collection.
If go every becomes dominant, it will probably have to have dynamic linking.
But I hope they hate dynamic linking.
I am not sure.
Why is assembly not used?
What about psuedo assembly that go uses?
It really is.
It has a one to one mapping.
I think it is too difficult to do anything that is not just maths.
Not anymore.
The compiler compiles to the exact same pseudo assembly then it gets passed to a library that converts it to real assembly based on platform with table lookups, and then links it.
The compiler knows nothing about the architectures. 
Only the library does.
Yeah.
I mean, if you were using dynamic memory allocation in c, you were probably making bugs.
All the local stuff is kept on the stack.
And when you get stack overflows, it is a little scary, because it makes another one and swaps them.
And using the stack that much seems like a disaster.
Also, did you see go's delay keyword?
delay [any line] causes it to run at the end of a function.
So if you want to do something when the main function ends, you can delay it and return anywhere.
Very nifty.
I expect with the increase of performance, memory management will become automatic and more reliable than hand written.
I mean, the dominant language will have it.
I am sure they will innovate somehow.
I mean stack swaps have pauses.
And c's thread locking will cause pauses.
firmware should never be written in anything but assembly.
C is just too high level for control.
I mean, I actually do not know how well go performs.
But then c also performs like dogshit compared to assembly.
I could try writing some basic races.
The gc would never run if you barely use memory.
Doing what?
I am not sure they will.
I mean they have ken and rob.
I believe they want people to be unable to write broken code.
ken thompson and rob pike.
I life without segfaults, is a life.
I think it is obvious how much influence google have in golang.
They choose who they pay to develop it.
But they choose the write people clearly.
right
wow
I am sure the rest are competent, since the language seems on point.
I mean, how on earth are they getting away with static binaries? 
Mention the word static on static exchange and everyone will ignore your question and tell you to use dynamic.
Seems like a legit aim.
stack
stackicexchange
Vim plugins with vim script is specific. 
Google have their dicks in almost everything.
Hmmm, an os inside of vim.
I would try it though, that sounds novel.
I learnt about vim recordings and holy shit.
:q[a-z] to start a recording.
then @[a-z] to play it back.
It is macros.
Makes my life stupidly easy when dealing with formatting text in certain ways.
Like a giant list of numbers and I want them split into arrays of n.
It allows object orientation.
The perfect language electrocutes anyone who tries to use a class.
Fuck you.
All it ever does it over complicate problems.
is
I forget I can edit my messages.
I forget I can edit your messages.
Damn.
Given the option of using it, sure you will think it is useful, but then 1000 lines in and the problem is evident.
The whole concept is fucked.
And with new best practices and methods coming out all the time for oo, each one more and more abstract.
You can use unions.
I refuse to believe anything is difficult in c.
Maps are.
But I can solve any problem in c way faster than any other language. 
I mean, haskell is fast, but it is way to difficult.
Thinking purely functional is too much effort.
too
After writing assembly, all languages seem way too abstract to take seriously.
Well, math is much easier in c.
Everything is much easier in c.
But still, abstract.
I once fell for the trap of python.
But it was painful to learn and write, so I ended up just doing it in c in no time.
Every time I think something is easier, I then do it in c and realise it is shorter and simpler in c.
I mean, having imap libraries and oauth, sure I am not going to make those connections myself.
And sure python will probably send an email in one line.
But that is not programming, it is more like a shell script with programs.
A c program that calls system() is shitty. 
And shell scripts are calling external programs all the time.
They are made to link together programs.
Which is very unix.
But it is super high level.
Yeah, but unreliable. 
And not very portable.
A shell script with ln or cp will differ across platforms.
How can I trust ls to list files and not split them into columns by default?
That would break any shell script.
Sure it is programming.
You can judge them if they praise a shitty language, or advocate greater use of it.
Say what?
I luckily do not meet people.
I met one guy who worked with embedded c.
But when you look at job advertisements and you see all the shitty languages companies are using.
They will be using that because their lead developer likes it.
Except I actually think go is a step forward for abstraction.
It still feels dirty because it is not assembly.
But for getting things done, it seems faster and easier.
Than c also.
Also, with no casting, strong typing, lesser use of pointers, maps, no memory management, passing functions, multiple return values, strings, utf8.
50% on c?
On another subject, deep learning.
What the fuck is going on there?
Neural networks and learning?
Is it a matter of years until hard ai pops out?
Solving problems with examples and not writing functions.
Seems crazy.
Well yeah, but humanlike intelligence does not progress so fast.
- the like
Just give it's score by how many humans it can stab from it's camera feed.
Stab is more vulgar I think.
Something like the crazy stabbing robot from futurama.
xom I remember this.
Let's turn it up till it pops.
mashup with the crazy electricity guy.
Yeah, I saw them all.
The bright lamp one is pretty insane.
And the massive chain.
He has a special thing set up that allows him to use more electricity right?
With his provider. 
Then there was the time he managed to turn off all the street lights.
In his latest video he has a friend who has the exact same accent.
No idea what this song is but the cat works.
Blu ray is 7.1 audio, right?
It pains me how small video streams are.
Come in Mariam.
Did we ever mention the pi3?
Built in wifi reduces the cost quite a bit.
100Mbps is too slow to use for any network stuff.
Even watching movies can struggle with that.
They are usually around 25GiB for the actual film, right?
Convert to b is 200Gib.
Being modest and saying the film length is 130 minutes.
But bd50s come with extras and all sorts.
25.6 I got.
Not good for general storage though.
I tried it.
Even 1Gb/s was too slow.
Waiting for things a 120MiB/s these days is eugh.
I mean raw video is fucking humongous. 
It is okay though because sensors are also balls is most cases.
Going to get a pi zero and turn it into a public porn streaming hotspot xom.
You connect to it's wireless open network and it has a samba and nfs share for porn.
Connect it to a large battery and stick it in your pocket.
Sit in airport.
Serve ads.
Make a custom battery case and just stick it in there.
Yes.
Cut mac addresses off after an hour and start charging.
Tell them what you look like and request money.
Tell them to follow the wifi strength.
I am the guy in the fedora.
Yeah man, you got the dosh?
Password is Firesong, capital f.
Is there no language standard?
haha
pypy is not reliable enough for a lot of projects.
I can not set the pypy flag in gentoo and compile all python stuff with it because it is too broken.
Just took my keyboard apart for the first time for cleaning.
Stupidly dirty.
They should have marked functions as depreciated and retained compatibility.
Nah, still the performance.
Think I might change this room fro yellow and pink.
Also, the pi's official language is python.
Which means it is capable of adding a few numbers per second.
They support it and their library for gpio and such is in python.
And they encourage people to start coding in python on the pi.
I want one of those astro hat things.
With all the sensors and large lcd grid.
Probably led actually.
It just looks cool.
Wait, I can run vector on the server?
I never considered it.
Hmm, it looks like just html, css, and js.
Yeah.
Going to give this a shot.
You might not be able to connect for a bit.
I think I have the ports set up wrong.
I forgot how I set them up before.
I managed to get my to dwm time from after the firmware to 3s.
Pretty insane.
Makes windows 10s look bad.
Windows 10's 10 seconds.
Odd.
Use static?
Do you have netmounts or something?
Right, going to start fucking with ports.
Are you there?
Actually, I figured it out.
What was the brand of router you got?
I forgot the port to connect to it.
Could you restart the router? It does not seem to be working right.
No wait, never mind.
Why is it that curl works flawlessly and chrome does not.
Every time a website does not seem to load, or takes forever, curl gets it instantly.
Oh sweet.
Yeah, I am sorting all the port nonsense out and setting up vector.
Think I might have done it now.
A bit slower to load at first, but fewer privacy concerns and the default server is already set.
Shit this is cool.
Running a newer version of vector too.
0.7.4 vs 0.7.3
Some obvious ui changes.
And a deactivate account option in settings.
Mariam.
I have good news.
But you do plan on using the domain, right?
I always felt bad entering my password on vector.im
I mean, same code running, but yeah.
Yeah, if I told someone to go to vector.im they would be presented with a giant ad for vector.
Also, no leave room button at the top.
I used to click it trying to log out.
And no need to set to custom homeserver.
I set the https server to the recommended mozilla intermediate profile.
So older clients and phones can access matrix (I am reverse proxying the matrix port).
I will test it now to see how it scores.
This is crazy, but I am about to attempt to upgrade the server.
Hey, could you restart the server for me?
I made a mistake and now I can not restart it.
Just the usual off, wait, on.
Accidentally dropped from root and now I can not reboot it.
Wow, updated to 5.9
I think synapse is an openbsd package now.
Okay, should support http2 now.
Oh wow, http2 uses binary instead of text.
Have not seen it in forever.
Why, what happened to your finger?
On a computer if you go to them.
You caaaan do it on a mobile, but the apps exist for a reason.
Upstairs the childen scream and run for around 35% of every day.
Then they go out at around midnight and come home with their parents at 5am.
4am.
Everyday.
They scream like they want no throat.
And cry.
The parents are absolutely the worst.
The same guy who beats his wife.
So I imagine he just hits his children.
I have no idea.
But to be keeping 5-6 year olds up to that time every day.
It is 30 minutes before sunrise.
It is not healthy.
And school?
The children are just broken humans at this point.
3-4 hours of crying and screaming a day.
Oh nice.
Imagine they had anything.
It is something like 1 in 3 families.
Since beating your wife and raping her is not illegal.
Also, anally raping a woman is not illegal.
Well, you can get mad and hit them once, but beating is regular and more intense.
Could I get you to test something with a cable?
Can I call here yet?
Not yet then.
Facebook?
Come in.
My sister switched to the more reliable connection.
The server is back on the Gbps ethernet cable so no more random dropouts.
After they changed the router I could not get them to get it working but the powerline adapter worked.
But it is shit and drops the connection 10-20 times a day for a minute to 5 each time.
?
Lisa did the thing I wanted to test with the cables and it worked so no need to wake up tomorrow.
Not sure if you ever use it but instead of ssh you can use mosh.
It uses ssh for authentication and then mosh uses udp to hide latency.
Also to reduce latency.
It works really well.
HELLO
I made tameya.
Tell me if everything works perfectly now.
Using udp I am really impressed by how fast it responds.
Okay good now we can talk 100 times more.
Are you able to view that?
Nah, wait.
This is my year and a half worth of dirt.
Although it did turn it upside down and bang it quarterly. This was post banging. 
Hmmmm.
Did you disable background data for it?
Is it something to do with permissions on iOS?
Does it not log in at all on mobile data,
Can you show me the login screen when it fails in a screenshot?
It looks like Vodafone are not good at running dns servers, but mobile operators also force you to use their ones.
Wait... I can connect using vodafone, let me try.
Test test.
Yeah, it works fine.
It will complain that the certificate is wrong.
That is, on mobile data.
Yeah, you can visit the real address of the server.
But not the name of the address.
Which is the job of the dns server.
Your phone gets given a real address of a dns server by vodafone.
Your phone asks that server what the real address of "lost.host" is, and it returns 81.134.14.189 and your phone connects to my server (after checking security and such).
But the dns server is clearly not good.
And it says it can not find lost.host's real address.
But a dns server's job when it does not have the address on the server is to ask other dns servers until it finds the address, and then it stores that address.
Which is how all website names work.
On wifi, your router has a built in dns server usually.
And it will ask the internet service provider's dns server when it does not know.
Or, you can change the server your router will ask.
You can also change the server your computer asks.
You can change the server your phone asks when using the router too.
But mobile service providers are hitler.
Did you like my tameya and clean keyboard?
DNS servers update address and refresh all the time.
Two years ago, all the internet in the uk went out because someone fucked up one of the main dns servers.
For a whole day.
Oh, I forgot to mention a basic: DNS means domain name system.
I am too hot.
I would but you are in bed.
Why am I burning hot?
NO.
Good morning.
I just woke up.
Was it down?
OSOTY
Oh, it has been working since I mentioned it.
Once your browser caches shit, it loads fast all the next times.
Pretty swank, right?
Well no, the buttons have different style.
I have tea and cleaned everything.
Toka left at 3pm so she should be home soon.
This will be her song.
That video is very weird.
I am not going to go spending any money until I have an income in Ireland.
It feels a little abandonist to leave toka.
And at a time that the visa could come through and we would be planning and preparing to emmigrate.
I think it is just bad timing.
I mean, I check multiple times a day.
Our number is 25595852
The site takes a while to load though.
Facebook's ceo decides to pay women to kill any one who leaves, sells facebook stocks, or hacks them.
Yeah.
But a lot of the time the publish any old day.
Holy shit.
Youtube dropped support for rss last year.
Which made me use a youtube account to find new videos.
Scroll to the bottom, "Export to rss feeders", an ompl file with rss feeds for all the channels.
I hope this means I can just use newsbeuter and pipe to mpv again.
Her bus was cancelled and has not left yet.
What is the point in spending five hours on a bus, a few hours at the destination, then messing around with busses just to spend another five hours on a bus, then another hour in cairo getting home.
I could go to scotland in 9 hours.
My mum just offered to pay for me to go back to scotland for two weeks but I do not want to abandon here.
It is just too close to a possibly important time.
Possibly moving.
I can never be bothered copying and typing it in, but with newsbeuter I can just open the article automatically.
A chrome extenstion that stops you opening youtube urls and launches it with mpv would be pretty cool.
Signed in?
When I used it, it was just for searching and playing.
Oh wow, she will not be home until 8am.
Come back.
I have only had a piece of bread with onions in today.
I think I eat more with toka here.
I will have popcorn.
Hmmmm.
I guess we did not check the old ones.
But they should have contacted us because she needs her passport and visa back.
Checking the site is just a day or two early.
Go send a message to me, as a test.
Okay, thanks.
Go for another message.
Okay good.
Hi.
Yes.
I can but my eyes will say "eugh".
Can you send me some cornflakes. Like in a way where I can actually eat them?
I want to taste them.
I wonder how I send files in here.
Okay here.
Hmm, it keeps failing at the very end.
I will email it.
Wait.
Any moment now.
Hahahah whoops.
Thanks.
They are saying, "eugh, where is the popcorn you promised me".
Okay enough hunger. I will make it.
Like popcorn?
Where?
There is nothing here.
Are you on your phone?
Ah, yes, mine was doing that on chrome.
But my phone worked.
This client actually showed me the error.
error: curl error 6 (Couldn't resolve host 'lost.host')
I think it is using it's own version of curl and trying to use ssl3.
Or it is trying to send unencrypted.
I will have to look into it.
Why do I get so hot around this time?
It is the coldest.
Why is in not in your mouth.
Maybe short term but putting acid on your skin is not good.
If you look at figure 5, d is citric acid, and a is nothing.
"In conclusion, we demonstrated that longer interval treatment with AHA agents, especially glycolic or lactic acids, increased the thickness of the epidermis, decreased melanin deposits and upregulated collagen I and procollagen I levels. AHA agents may be effective treatments for various conditions of the skin and for cutaneous diseases."
I have no idea why you would want those changes.
There are lots of studies on the effectiveness of acids on skin conditions.
But for its effect on healthly skin, no so.
Plenty of patents for it, which makes me want to burn people.
Come back.
Oh wow you are back late.
It is mainly for sun damage I think.
I never looked that much.
I might.
I would if she brought food.
But I do not want to ask her to get any because she might be very tired.
She should be back in cairo in an hour.
She went somewhere north.
Not yet.
Eww.
A girl was in a car and talking to a guy outside the window.
She threw a tissue out the window as I was passing so I picked it up and threw it back in her car.
As I walked off they both looked at me like I was a bad person, so I proceeded to give them a prolonged middle finger.
Thanks <3
I would make pasta but there is no eggplant or soya mince.
I imagine your family would make it difficult for you.
You might get away with it if you just start saying you do not like the taste of things, slowly, over time.
Toka's parents spend entire evenings arguing with themselves about me being vegan.
And I have never brought it up once.
They start talking about how their meat is special and good.
And how fish are not running out.
A lot of people, as soon as they know, become defensive.
As if I have called out their ethics, and respond as if I attacked their ethics.
They try justifying everything they do, and they try saying why I am wrong.
And I say nothing.
And then half of people do not care one bit.
I wonder if she has slept on the bus or will go straight to bed.
Maybe I can make some noodle soup stuff.
You know those tiny little noodle sticks?
Did you abandon me?
I woke up.
Wake up.
Where are you.
It is time.
Utopia
Breaking bad.
Archer.
Game of thrones
Rick and morty
I mean the creators are known for some awful previous projects but maybe.
Oh I still have to watch season two of better call Saul.
The walking dead is pretty mediocre but zombies so you must.
Lost is actually very good if you binge it.
Archer is really funny.
Not required for EU application but she sent them anyway.
Animated series.
She is applying under EU law, not national law.
Look at all the hair.
Probably too hot.
And it knows it can get food from any house.
From the years of building neighbour relations.
Get a profile picture, jeez.
Now he is good friends with them all he can afford to put on a bit of weight.
Is there no family photo we can put as this room's photo?
I checked every pdf this morning.
The application was submitted around two months ago now, I think.
Maybe.
So June.
I noticed.
Going to build sabotage linux and give it a try.
Gives a decent rundown of what it is.
The one thing that makes me hate gentoo, is the package manager is in python.
Also, the entire core system of sabotage is statically built against musl libc.
The only problem I can forsee is the lack of build/package recipes, but they look pretty simple, and I do not use much software I do not know how to build myself.
I always thought package management should be like this.
Where are you.
Eugh.
Well, Toka is home and we went for food.
Oh no, we need to go to the other market for them.
It is that time I get stupidly hot.
I am quite.
But I want to wait for this kernel to finish compiling.
Hahahaha salty fucks.
Not making money with open source so close source it and hold it ransom until people give you money.
Pretty sure they are not allowed to close source any code people have contributed under gpl without them waiving rights.
Hello.
What was that channel that did songs like the animal riding a turtle and the ipone one?
Nice
Ipad.
Struggled to find it.
Mariam.
Are they gone yet?
Are you better now?
How long is it?
I will give it a try.
I noticed in the introduction to Capital that he mentions that Marx believed that "England" was the only country that could reach a revolution through..., you know what, let me quote it.
One moment.
Did you know about this? Know anything more about this? 
Yeah, the introduction to Capital wrote by him in the book.
Marx more so earlier on.
I mean, I want to read enough to find out where this opinion was, and what is was based on.
I really wish Karl was immortal to hear his running commentary on everything.
I can see how it can happen, but I a little unsure about how the ruling class could ever let it get to that stage.
Yeah, but laws change.
I can imagine how people gain more influence over politics and law making.
And I can imagine that they could gain more power, but fascism would happen.
Like the ruling class would have a fit before it does.
I am more curious to why he thought it could happen in "England".
Giving Capital my third try.
Fucking whip me if I stop this time.
Yeah, it disturbs me the use of the word England there.
BAHEBIIIIIIIIIIK
Well, he used the blue books.
He was well aware of the conditions of the workers.
I think he was well aware of the whole situation in the UK.
But, again, I want to see the source for this before anything else.
Is scotland independant yet?
Jeez, hurry it up.
Get a move on.
Build the damn wall.
Come in.
Mariam.
Mariam.
8am is normal now.
Plus I have coffee.
Why are you awake?
Is she putting flowers on your head again?
Hey wait.
Wait faster.
Wow, I thought the upload thing would be fixed.
Hold on, I have an idea.
Okay now I am out of ideas.
I will just email it.
It was the same day as the piggy back photo.
There is one without clothes but pfft.
No no, I am not crazy enough to wear clothes at hot time.
Although, I am not hot yet.
Did you try to send a photo?
WHY NOT
I just tried to fix that but it still did not work.
One more try.
Oh interesting.
I just made a change.
Maybe now.
No falling.
I want to fix it.
Okay I give up for tonight.
 /jabber
When did you unfall?
Wow.
Why not pick Gary as a username.
Matrix shits on xmpp.
Hahaha no.
When Google hangouts first did face detection.
Have you read snapchat's privacy policy?
Fuck that.
Fine, waiting to go to Ireland.
When toka's visa comes through.
Taking forever.
Capital G.
Yes.
Now you need a bangin photo.
Oh, photo uploads might be broken right now. Just started happing a few days ago, have not figured it out yet.
Works from my phone tough.
Though.
Just a nibble. Not been doing much.
I was cleaning it...
All phones are shitty.
Toka switched to my layout.
Glorious.
Toka says hi.
Got her addicted to stardew valley too.
Brilliant game.
I have 75 hours in it now.
Hey, get an avatar!
I want the newest nuc before I can play that again.
Played it a lot on Kirsty's computer.
AND I AM NOT IN THAT LIST
Yeah you did.
But I never got to hear.
You said talking, jeez.
Because they are not around much?
Wow.
Then again, I would never befriend someone who sells their labour-power to the military of an imperialist nation.
Or the police.
Makes no difference to me.
Anyway, I hope you stay here this time so we never stop talking again.
I am off to cook dinner.
Eggplant, pepper and tomato pasta.
Sucks with soya mince.
But we ran out last week and have been lazy.
I am sorry xmpp and iOS sucks ass.
Samsung took a bad turn with devolpers I think.
Much less support for custom ROMs now.
Should have went Motorola or nexus.
Motorola are the shit.
Meh fuck all phones.
I only watch like one series a year.
Heard of sabotage Linux?
It absolutely nails how package management should be done.
I use gentoo currently.
You get much more customisation building from source.
Dwm
There are no prebuilt packages.
The package manager builds from source.
Even Toka uses it now.
Do you not have internet...?
It is not worth it.
Pfft.
You can chat with me.
215 is a legit time.
Well, time for me to read the bible.
Mariam.
*Capital
Das Kapital
Oh jeez.
Why would you want a PDF over a sane format for books?
You can not access it.
The entry is too strict.
You need to borrow and de DRM books to stay a member.
Capital is free.
All the books worth reading are either so old they are free, or so common you can download from Google.
Go on what and check the invite forum for comic trackers.
mmarmiramira
b
I feel like there should be a linux distribution based on forced music playback.
Where is constantly plays the latest bangin' tunes.
And all security focus is on stopping people from being able to stop the music.
Forget early kernel mode setting, the music starts during the bootloader.
It constantly uses as much bandwidth as it can to download new music.
Every removable device you plug in, it starts filling it with transcoded wav files.
Periodically checks for any html inputs and puts your current song in it and presses submit.
Hi.
Why are you awake.
.6>zoX.+2t.`fC&(DGP%m"Lu-
I was just going to bed.
I was bored tonight.
I will.
Do you not want me to?
Onesies.
I will get into bed but I will still talk.
I just drank a whole bottle of water.
I hope I do not keep waking up to pee.
Does Nada snore?
I like when the smell of food wakes me.
Say because sane people wake up when the sun does.
Oh god Dubai is a sham.
Rich people with shitty laws and exploited workers for rich tourists.
Why will you fly there?
The state of imported labour there is disgusting.
I napped all day.
I thought you could not connect on mobile data.
It is time.
Yooooooooou
Confined to a phone keyboard right now.
Toka is teaching.
And I am trapped in a room.
And never open the door.
Trying to block them out with Melbourne bounce.
But the YouTube app does not background like the good old days.
Also blocking out dog abuse.
But that is another story.
Just search melbounce bounce and there is this playlist of 170.
Here is the song I am at.
Not sure if it is in the playlist in that link.
It stops every time I come here to talk though.
Never found another person who likes Melbourne bounce.
But then I have never really met any one since it existed.
I fucking hate trap.
Every time I hear a trap build up or "drop" I want to burn children with soldering irons.
I mentioned this.
Apparently if you select small it will work.
Hello.
I have been so bored.
Is it a hand?
I made falafel.
Oh yes.
Still looks like a witch hand.
Although witches have square nails.
The flower really did.
I have been so bored the last 30 hours.
No idea.
The weekend, fewer YouTube videos.
Hodamander?
I know a hoda.
Not going to play that.
Also outside is cancer.
I never wear anything.
It is too hot.
I followed this one too.
Hey I am the qualified cake producer.
Mariam.
Will you tell @mahamken to speak to me.
If you ever get bored.
You can open my keyboard and put all the keys on.
I want to see how it looks.
The right pupil looks like a screaming face.
Also the eyes have eyes.
Man I hope they leave very soon; I need to pee.
Pfft too religious.
Even worse.
Eyes with faceual.
Okay, I am on the pc now.
What is going on with the floor?
Where are you and why is it so messy?
Why is there mail on the floor?
Why is the outlet on the wall squint?
Why on earth do you have two nail clippers?
And so many shades of yellow.
And what is that, wood, or cardboard, and why is it so big?
Toka is making fried eggplant pepper and tomato today.
It sounds the same but it is different.
It is more like deep fat frying them with garlic and tomato sauce, not tomatoes.
And you eat it with bread.
Also the pieces are much bigger.
And you cook it longer.
It is called misa2a2a, or something.
Where are you living?
The room looks too big for a single person.
What the fuck.
That around four times bigger than our flat.
Eye guess, around 6x12m.
This does not look like you.
You look angry and old.
And like you are punching yourself in the face.
Also, eww snapchat.
Hmmm, email?
Yeah.
Big ones?
It is mahamken.
Ah, yeah, screenshots are small.
Also yes.
Hmmm, I still think big photos will not send.
But obviously do not make it public.
I mean my email address.
Just say Paul is wondering if you are alive.
Okay but you are a messenger.
I do not know the postmen.
Toka is due in a day or two.
Yes.
We are going to go for a short walk at 5:30.
I think it is the quietest time.
My body hurts when I sleep too much.
We had misa2a2aha today.
Will you send you?
Oh I can tell and it pains me.
You look so good in orange.
Email email.
The light is good too.
It makes you look warm and joyful.
Did you die.
Will I have to get Maha to tweet you?
Downloading stranger things.
Should start tomorrow.
We went for the walk.
It was nice.
Explain what the hell a cat cafe is.
Anything else.
A way to contact me maybe.
There is no way you are not going to adopt another cat.
No.
Dogs are awful.
They require too much attention.
They can not even poop by themselves.
I guess she if she wants to email me, you can put my email, but delete it once she replies. 
Also, use paul (at) lost (dot) host
To stop parsers.
I suppose so.
This feels like a mission.
I am about to try fiddling with the server so if you can not send messages, do not worry.
Okay I am back.
Hello.
There is a site that tells you how long games are with main story and 100%.
Will you show them to me?
Xbox one players finish in 43h average...?
Or bad.
Pfft, a giant cookie is still a cookie.
On episode 4 now.
I take it you finished?
What is dawnguard?
Did you finish?
Oh, correct.
Do they need cooked more?
Also why do you have nail makeup.
Mariam.
Anything that is not just nail is creepy.
Are they ready?
I am watching Stranger Things with Toka.
Well, it is okay.
Why so early?
Did you fall at two.
Oh Hi.
I thought you were asleep so I went back to fiddling with the server.
Making progress now.
I did it!
If uploading images does not work now, it is not my fault, it is a bug with matrix.
YES
Holy shit I fixed the image thing.
Switched from nginx to relayd+httpd.
I mean, I lose http2 support, but then again, httpd is much better.
Having lost.host go to vector and have matrix communicate over https is pretty eugh.
Any traffic going through http (80) goes straight to httpd which gives a 301 return to https (443).
443 goes to relayd, which load balances and decrypts the traffic, then filters off any requests containing /_matrix/* and forwards them to port 8008, the unencrypted matrix server, and then falls back to port 4040, the unencrypted http server.
I get free load balancing here since I unwrap the encrypted traffic and forward to server tables, although I only have one server so pfft.
I had to fix this because I noticed some matrix requests were timing out.
And I was afraid they would be messages or read receipts and not just photos.
I told gary how I did it:
Okay, I hope everything is super perfect now.
How old was the old unsent message?
You can send the orange Mariam photo now.
I want the cookies.
Are you alive?
Send send?
Yes.
Acquired taste I think.
I am okay that you can not.
I know I am so selfish.
I have been awake since half five.
Now I know it is out of focus :(
It is focused on the curtain or something.
Do you like tahini?
I just ate two spoons of it.
And a tomato.
Just blended sesame seed.
Not yet.
Purring.
Because you are hungry, or because you are a female?
Bread and tahini.
All the cookies.
I want egg plant pasta.
I had some for breakfast.
I need to shower.
Nonononono
Be one piece.
Whoa.
My current self says no.
But who knows who I will turn into.
I think she is the same.
Will you have a miniariam?
Or Aquariam.
Mariopolis.
I mean, you do own mariam@lost.host
Magniam.
A classic.
Marmaduke.
A dog from a movie maybe.
I have no idea.
I want breakfast.
I will go in a minute too.
After a lot of water.
My head hurts too much to sleep.
Three hours.
I woke up.
I almost got up at 11.
Okay stranger things time.
Last episode now.
Reminds me of the film, "Ink".
Also, Utopia is much better.
Okay that is finished.
Are you ready?
Come in.
The acting and writing was iffy, and attention to detail and realism was lacking.
The characters did not act like real people a lot.
Ink is low budget.
Ink is crazy low budget.
Just watch utopia on putlocker or something.
Also, I have ink on DVD somewhere.
Blocked in the UK more likely.
The UK pushed for law to block the pirate bay when the conservatives got power.
Then they used the law to block every torrent and file sharing site legitimate or not.
And then they made pornography in England blocked by default and you have to opt into it.
Yeah no.
Are you home now?
Are you hungry?
I had pasta.
Toka is in bed already.
Nope.
She teaches at home right now.
Eugh I hate hate hate dogs.
The one downside of open source software:
Googling an error message and the only result on google is the source code.
100% server side.
100% lynx compatible. 
I used to be boss at oil pastels.
New melbourne bounce mix.
Yeah that is pretty cool.
Just use the search function of this.
How can you listen to it quiet enough at the library not to piss people off?
Just the local gary doing hardstyle melbourne shuffle in the oversized books section.
... that is slow as shit.
That is five times faster than my connection here in egypt, and I pay for the slow speed.
Okay 8MiB is the speed of my home connection in scotland.
At that speed, I only downloaded blu-rays.
But I would never risk it on a public internet connection.
That shit is logged and observed. 
Unlike my isp where it is logged and forgotten.
When you read your library's or school's terms on using their internet, it is fucking disgusting.
I stopped using the university's connection because it was so vile.
You better read that before they find you.
Ask them if there is any terms or policies on using their connection.
Because if they do not present them before you reading them, you have never accepted the terms.
All devices are know by the router they are connected to.
No such thing as a hidden device.
they're
And all the traffic.
And rampant encrypted tcp data going through a port.
To random ip addresses around the world, not a media server.
Sure.
It uses no javascript so it will work on everything.
I hope you stay awake.
Toka dyed her hair again.
It is very very bold now.
Blue/purple.
Well, I think nice is bald.
She likes it though.
I shaved my head two days ago.
Did you fall already.
Not bad.
Need tea.
"Hey do you want to play some music?"
"What kind of music?"
"The party music"
She meant melbourne bounce.
Drink.
I have a new pack of coffee too.
Went to drinking green tea because the coffee place was too far away.
Of course.
I woke up at half two.
Why ate your legs sore?
Come in today.
At least she likes it.
I think you have only ever been here at this time once.
Think I will give rimworld a go.
lost.host/mail is now a 0% javascript mail client
Hey.
Holy shit, rimworld is 800% as deep.
Rimworld is about 10x more complex than when I last played it.
Going to reboot into something else, might not be here for a while.
Have to compile firefox I think.
Change of plan.
Not doing that.
Toka has 62 hours in stardew valley now.
I have about 4000 in your mum.
I tried to sleep at half four but fucking dogs.
You remembered your password for once.
I woke up.
Are you alive?
test
tost
test
test
Okay finally.
Openbsd 6.0 came out this morning so I just installed it.
Getting pretty good at remotely upgrading.
HELLO AGAIN
You are accidentally connecting to outernet?
Or you are just too far from the wireless.
You hate your wireless.
One way to get good internet on your laptop is to use the old bt powerline adapters to your room and connect your laptop by cable.
We do not have fibre optic to the house.
We have fibre optic to the telephone exchange.
And then plain old vdsl.
I know the internet to the house is perfectly fine because the server is solid on the cable.
The problem is wireless, and shitty wireless.
I hate wireless internet so much.
Oh, lisa, connect to the 5ghz channel if you are not already.
Should get better signal.
Or maybe not, 2.4 might give better signal.
5ghz if there are lots of other wireless networks near.
2.4 if your neighbours are dead.
Oh yeah, try using the 5ghz one.
It says the signal is worse, but who knows, give it a shot.
fewer bars
Wireless.
Well, I got my pi working again.
You stole the micro sd card.
Nope, but if it was two buses, I could have met you at the bus stop to give you the card.
What are you doing.
Get a grip.
It is the wireless signal.
Not the internet.
How many times do I need to say that?
Oh my fucking god.
Mummy pays nothing for the wireless.
Mummy pays for the internet connection.
What kind of wireless hardware can you expect when you pay the same for the wireless router as a toaster?
A decent wireless router that works at those speeds costs around 80gbp.
You live in an old house with thick walls and you are on a different floor.
Complain as much as you want about the wireless in the house.
Stop blaming the router on the internet connection.
Everything you have said tonight is a complaint against the internet connection to the house, when the problem is the connection between the router and your computer.
I have suggested two things to improve your connection to the router.
And you have no acknowledged the source of your problem correctly yet.
You kept spurting false accusations about the house's internet connection.
Call out a BT Engineer to check that wire to the house and listen to them tell you there are zero problems and charge you.
Ask them why the internet is slow/broken in your room and listen to them tell you that the wireless signal is poor in old houses and especially vertically.
They will recommend a powerline adapter.
Which I already did.
Which I already bought a wireless version, which happens to have firmware issues and is a nightmare.
They gave us four powerline adapters when they put in the connection.
The house it too big for one router.
If you want the best wireless, buy a second wireless router and set up a relay chain for the second floor.
There are so many options, but none of them work if you think the problem is with BT and the internet to the house.
If you want none of those, sit in the kitchen or living room for the internet.
Wireless only works well across one floor of a building, the signal does not move well up and down through floors.
Compare this issue to clean running water again and I am out of here.
Mariam.
Ah, yes, I hope it means you can send me more messages and photos!
Oh, I am messing around a lot with something.
I would not take right now as an indication of anything.
Okay no longer fiddling.
Is it working on mobile?
Eww.
Why did it work for a bit?
I did not change anything.
I have pop corn.
I am a master at making it now.
We have no microwave.
In a pan.
Hey.
Mariam.
Come in.
HI.
Wait, let me poo.
No.
Do you still have a sore leg?
Why were they sore?
DO YOU THINK SORE LEGS ARE CONNECTED TO WORKING MOBILE DATA?
Toka is bleeding like a cold water tap that expels blood instead of water.
Yeah, very bad.
I am sure it is as bad as anyone elses.
Just keep fighting the pressure to have a child.
TOka gets me to sit on her and press super hard.
Have you tried sitting on yourself?
Do you lose your appetite?
:(
But food.
Food is good.
I am actually really thirsty.
I really.
Is the water full of caffiene?
Maybe some memrise?
I just got a piece of corn out from under a gum.
It was so annoying.
I had to use tweezers.
Tomorrow I wake up early and walk to the market and then toka's parents.
What will you do?
Did you fall.
Hi.
I know it. It is a flower.
I want more tea but it is so late.
I might have some anyway.
WHY CAN WE NOT MEET
Aniseed.
Who wants to say anise seeds.
Oh yes. you can add an ice cube.
You broke your laptop screen?
Is this windows 1?
Skype...
Eww windows.
Oh you should probably leave these behind.
You should have memories and emotions with people not with old laptops.
Just people, places, sounds and smells.
Well we need to go for a walk before then.
Oh yes. Not too many because they are a little expensive.
Some chocolate ones.
I just miss my soya milk.
I just get them from a giant bag.
Like all the other grains and pastas.
I have the powder stuff.
I have a lot of it left.
Okay it is be super hot time.
Wow.
I actually really like the lost.host/mail
I fiddled with the server today, (and updated the operating system), now there is no longer an exploit in one of the ciphers so now it supports every browser but internet explorer 6.
Maybe it works now, but it is nice for computers, the email app is more suited on phones.
The page is absolutely tiny.
It is probably 30 times smaller than google.com
I will check in a moment.
You bring the laptop and surf this chat forever.
Probably the stupid dns.
SNEAK
Which email do you use now?
gmercado?
Well, I pick the option that keeps you here longest.
It is said like kamomile. Which makes the spelling weird. 
Wow, character is also weird.
It is funny because in programming char is short for character and it is pronounced like chat.
I AM SO FAST AT TYPING I CAN REPLY BEFORE YOU FINISHED ASKING.
But I hate cars.
Ch is basically always chat.
What is eh ez bee.net?
Wow, anything ending in .NET will give you cancer.
In Egyptian English voiceless and voiced dental frictives are s and z respectively. 
In london they are f and v.
In the north of scotland and scandinavia they are t and d.
In ireland they are t and d too.
I like phonetics.
Keyboards and typing.
A little.
Just applying the s and z and copying it naturally.
But it might also sound a little indian/russian because accents are not my thing.
It probably sounds nothing a like.
But it sounds like something.
I sent it...
Round about...
NOW.
GOGOGOGO
Not russian though.
In russian this time?
Can I do it tomorrow?
I do not want to wake toka.
Oh, I forgot to check the size of google vs lost.host mail
It does not keep you awake.
I am so so hot.
Did the tshamomile make you sleep.
Did you try sitting on it?
Okay bed time.
There is no water.
You should delete the tweet with my email now.
She has taken too long.
Oh god is is so hot.
What do you guys define a hurricane as?
We have rain an wind all the time.
Nobody bothers to know if it is a hurricane.
They just say the wind is insane.
Oh I saw that.
It does have 100 mario challenge though.
Just no searching by code.
Which seems odd.
What would they gain from it?
It just seems unfinished.
Nobody thought a 3ds version would exist.
Wake up.
I remember this one.
Bawbag.
The scottish way of saying ballbag.
I went to the top of an observatory hill in it.
Holy shit I almost died to death.
This is apparently the scale we use. Nothing about the organised cyclonic system.
I am now in the find the fastest hurricane ever mode.
I read that 165 for six seconds and every building is fucked.
I mean, I will pirate it.
Mariam.
Intetnet pesant, are you high?
Mariamriamriam
I slept 9pm to midnight.
But now my face hurts so much I need coffee.
And I am so hungry.
And I am not that happy either.
So you can be here now.
Phones.
They deep sleep.
You can check notification settings, since they are account based, not client.
But it is likely just your phone deciding battery is more important.
Also, push notifications are not a thing on android unless you send all your messages to google servers first.
Which was a fucking crime.
The google play vector client has google push messaging and the fdroid version does not.
But I think the server does not allow it.
I do not know, I do not use vector.
I use weechat.
Weechat is a piece of shit.
Why would he not use irssi?
Weechat is the only command line client matrix has support for.
I never even knew you had a dad.
Is he a chinese hacker on the run from the government?
Yeah, I just only heard your parrot, cats, and mum.
Why is your mum in Tampa?
Yeah, I remember your brother.
And I am hungry.
Are your parents separated?
Wow.
I need to make some coffee.
My head is dead.
Did you see the lbry protocol thing?
As far as I can tell it is a protocol like bittorrent but with built in ratio for video sharing.
A lot of people are skeptical.
Coffee is better than nothing?
Wow.
If you said coffee is worse than nothing, that would make sense.
Also, project ara dead like it should be.
It is very much like a ratio torrent system.
It is more interesting than anything.
Hello.
I did the dishes.
But I am so sore and hot.
Oh, yes.
You could tell some google employee started it as their side project.
They should have been ridiculed.
No coffee and a lack of sleep.
And too much walking outside without water.
Hey.
Been cooking anything new these days?
:(
Have you tried reinstalling the app?
I did not, I was too dead at the market to think.
But we got soya mince so it is fine.
Have you tried googling it?
I have no idea.
These are all the known issues with it.
I will make coffee.
I had real orange juice.
Okay coffee brewing.
Did you see the streetpass update?
Did you die?
Where did you go?
No.
It is never too late for Mariam, Paul, or Coffee.
You should make it.
Because you like it and if you do not get out of bed you might fall asleep.
I could do with making some flapjacks.
Never seen oats around here though.
Hi Mariam.
For good?
Why do you not want to?
Does your head hurt?
I made pasta and had the coffee and now I have water.
I had a pain killer too.
I want these right now.
They still need cooked but still.
Do you not feel safe sleeping next to Hla?
I hear she keeps knives in her pillow.
I am watching someone play Life is Strange.
I have already played it but it is good.
Weak ass tree.
Interested in playing worms wmd?
I could see if gary could join too.
Have you seen worms WMD?
Does this fish have hair?
That is creepy.
Classic worms was fun multiplayer.
Although, if I invite gary and you guys just talk about trains.
Where are you.
Is it coffee time?
Drawing,
?
It says 3ab
Love apparently.
Never heard it though.
Your face is painting.
They use my love.
Habiby
And they use it for everyone.
Come in mariam.
I am too hot.
I am also too bored.
Give that a read over please.
About to send it to my member of parliment.
Are you there?
I just wrote a pretty long email addressed to Richard Lochhead, our MSP for Moray.
I have not sent it yet though.
Do you want to give it a read over?
Did you fall asleep?
Quickly, comment time is running out.
I can appeal against a visit visa.
But appealing follows the same rules, but you argue that you follow them.
I am hopping he can give an exception.
Hoping
But there is no visa to the uk that lets toka work and live there.
So nothing to appeal for.
I want to live in my home country. I miss my job, I miss my family, friends and colleges. I miss Scotland. I have no idea if there is anything you can do, but I ask for any help you can give so that I can live in my country with my family and wife.
Okay, nightmare bit out.
Well I did mention that a visit visa was rejected twice.
And that the plan was to visit my family.
I will send it.
Sent.
I think the only thing he can do is raise the issue with others and maybe to parliment.
But immigration is a UK reserved power.
So the Scottish parliament have no power in it.
But a few people have mentioned writing to him so I might as well.
I am fine, I just need to make some coffee.
I have some cold pasta from yesterday too.
I was awake to 10am last night.
You go to bed and you stay on your phone for four hours pretending to sleep.
Nah, cold pasta is good.
My 5am cooking and cleaning spree.
Me and lisa said that.
Are you alive?
I would not say well written.
I sent two spelling errors.
Why are you not at work?
OpenMW 0.40 video.
Mariamiramiram.
Hey.
You missed wow.
Wait.
Feen or whatever it is.
Qaf.
Final answer.
Qaf goes below the line.
Kaaf is the one after qaf.
Wait let me install Arabic.
Not in English but just put your tongue way back.
Like toqa.
Q
Well lowercase.
I fucking wish there was an IPA keyboard here.
No.
yes
the keyboard is nice but it locks symbols for cash
okay better look for a different one
When is the wedding?
Going to try to skip sleep tonight.
I am brewing the green tea right now.
I can feel the eyes.
No.
My eyes being tired.
I have no idea what the rows are.
Hey.
If I can do it, you can do it.
Unlikely.
I have never seen a post office.
Or a post man.
Fuck it, I will rest for a bit.
Jeez.
Why are there weird people in that?
Did they try to look for me but found some intruder?
Mariam.
Did you take medicine that made you not exist?
I switched from xf86-video-intel to the generic modesetting in xorg with glamor.
Works the same.
Some other things involved, but I just noticed.
:
diagonal tearing.
.............................................
It is not easy to see unless you have a checkered pattern. But it is there.
No mail box.
No letter box on doors.
w/oo, z, r, th, d, a/e/i
I have no idea.
Are they wild...?
Yeah, I noticed that.
I think Kate did too.
A bit hot and tired.
Are you fine now?
Did you get sleep?
Gary said that too.
Did the app update or something?
Why are these photos so large?
7MiB is larger than the full resolution photos from my camera.
Have you been playing stardew valley in real life?
They are tiiiiny.
It is high on lemons.
Hi.
I want to make flapjacks.
Well, I actually just want to eat them.
I am not.
Today was fatta day.
I will finish the rest of it now.
DId you sleep.
Which phone did you get?
Exactly.
It happens top left for about 600 pixels diagonal, then becomes horizontal.
Good morning.
Still, I think I beat everyone to it.
Jesus christ. 
Actual coffee?
I tried.
But it froze as I got too close and I spent five minutes thinking it was a loading screen.
I guess my computer can not handle it.
Were they not all recalled a few days ago because of exploding batteries?
24
But also, enough for a total recall.
Ewww milk.
I am sure it is just an intel thing.
They calculate the cost to them to just have them explode vs recalling.
And recalling all of them is hella expensive.
So they must expect exploding phones to cause a lot of financial damage.
I guess if your phone explodes you lose all rights because you went against their recall.
Probably is, but also in small print that you waive any rights if you refuse.
Kind of disturbing that the cold part looks to be the part that is visible to air.
Today's xkcd comic.
No you lazy bastard.
type the eight characters in your address bar.
Are you 126 now?
There better be a sun in this "painting".
Where is the sun.
How can a lake be higher?
Does it have a damn?
Are the planets boring though?
Yeah, you always bring this up.
Florida is like -100m below sea level.
Flatest state in the universe.
Mariam.
Who is that.
BHS shut down?
On that TV.
Mariam.
Is that dog not getting hair all over the house?
Remember how my breathing got at your dad's house.
No idea who pete is.
I think lisa mentioned something ages ago.
I have not been on windows in ages.
I want to get rich in it but I just have not been in a space mood for a while.
When your escape key responds.
What is pieala?
Yeah, but for mission scumming.
Children should be illegal.
They just scream on the street.
Wait, I think I know it.
Mariam.
Where are you.
Mariam mariam. Are you not talking because of something to do with notifications or connection or are you busy.
Toka is going to the north coast again for two days.
Hey.
That video is private.
HI
MARIAM
Pack to visit me for the next week.
I am here.
Are you still awake.
I miss you.
Nooooooooo :(
You are only allowed to send photos of you and not outside or inside or anything.
Yes.
Abu Dhabi is where the visa processing centre is.
Maybe you can go bribe them.
Seing anything touristy has started to annoy me.
Absolutely anything to do with tourism.
You tumbled.
Come in.
I will be too bored while toka is away if you are not here.
Oh, did you ever like roller coaster tycoon 2?
Because the open source engine for it is basically finished and it has online multiplayer co-operative.
And Ben does not like it.
Jeez.
The second was the best.
Correct.
Bit early for bedtime.
Wow.
I just accidentally created a folder in my home directory called ~
So I rm -rf ~
fucking shit
Luckily I had a backup from 20 minutes ago.
But jesus christ, creating a file called ~ should be impossible.
I realised after about 1 second.
But the ssd managed to delete everything in that time.
Yeah, there was a rumour about that.
Hello drm audio.
Also, how the fuck do you charge and listen at the same time without an adapter?
It is as fucking dumb as their one port mac.
It saves money.
hahahahahaha
The verge obviously.
I just googled iphone headphone jack and it was the first result.
Yes.
The verge are shills for apple.
I just use anandtech these days.
Reddit is about the only site I use a browser for.
Everything else is rss in newsbeuter, with scripts.
Made a pretty swanky dwm status bar in shell/c.
I applied a keycode patch so dwm uses keys rather than symbols for its config.
So the tags look like: well, I can not copy and paste it but they are greek symbols for alpha, beta, gamma and delta.
I patched dwm to not print any window title.
And on the right side I have this:
Without any new lines.
Hold on.
The first date is the last uploaded visa decision pdf to the irish embassy site.
Sorry that
The second is the progress off all my torrents.
The thrid forth and fith is the speed at which my router is connected to the internet, the speed at which btpd is downloading, and the upload speed my router is connected at.
The next is cpu usage, then free space on the home partition, then the time and date.
My router has a habbit of connecting at the wrong speed.
They are all updated at different times, the time every minute, the cpu usage every second, etc.
Oh god.
I mean, you can actually buy hdr monitors.
But I use my monitor on the lowest brightness these days.
Leaving it on normal feels like my eyes are getting a tan.
Yeah but the ps4 only needs 30fps xom.
Also, they always run with some medium level graphics preset.
Well, youtube claims 4k.
Exactly.
Which itself is at the same bitrate as a 480p video from ptp.
The pendrive is /dev/sdb1 and it is 16GiB
I just had some date things.
I will be home at about 6.
See if you can get transport to meet at 6:30ish.
Did you make the calendar?
I will message you when I am home in 15-20 minutes.
Did you leave yet?
Hot.
I need some tea.
I went to bed at 11am today.
It was so so noisey.
Two people hammering and drilling and grinding, kids screaming, dogs, car alarms.
Growling.
Having a laughing fit making google translate voice.
I mean, lots of things are worth it.
50gbp would do.
We should do a sentence game where we get to add one or two words at a time then send the sentence back as a link like that.
Also voice chat?
Sure.
Wow, kirsty would refuse 5,000gbp.
I would rim job for four hours for that.
Hi.
Want to hear mine and ben's collaborative poetry attempt?
Mariam.
Oi.
Click listen.
We finished the masterpeice so when you are about to listen, I will send you the latest version.
Finally, jesus.
Of course.
Is it boring?
What ever you fell asleep doing.
I just had taymeyaya. 
Now I am super thirsty.
Is being tired that boring?
I need to shower too. Toka left at midday today.
Was it messy.
I had ice water.
I still have not seen the photo of you and hazem.
I think it is tea time.
Just noticed this.
Come back.
Hey Mariam.
Tomorrow is official photo day.
I declare it.
I thought you left already.
I thought you were there.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE KATE
Cairo Airport is hell.
There is nothing but disorganisation. 
Everything is severly stupid at that airport.
Okay last mention of Cairo Airport.
I am getting high blood pressure.
What is the name for dinner so late it is also breakfast?
Decided to change the dwm bar a little.
No longer greek letters, but a penguin, chicken, snail, and rabbit for the tags.
Got rid of the total download progress, and free space stuff.
Changed the cpu load balance 1 minute average from 32% to well, a vertical block bar.
Gives eight different heights.
Toka is going to shit herself when she sees the animals as tags.
Wake up.
Have you gone.
I got into bed.
mmorpg even.
Mariiiiiiaaaaaaaam.
Six months with 5* the difference.
So around 38,000
No have read they still make it difficult for you though.
Mariam.
18,600, so 6,800*5 in savings.
You need to earn 18,600 a year.
If you do not earn that, take your income away from it, and times it by five.
so working with 12,000 a year, I need 30,000 in savings in the bank for six months.
Yeah six months working full time too I think.
Well, I just woke up.
So coffee time.
I really feel like an rpg.
Want the link to the poetry now?
68 metascore though
And the screenshots look way way above my level.
Jesus.
Actually maybe.
Not sure if I should install on windows or linux.
Oh, shit, I just assume games work on linux now.
Windows it is then.
I will leave it to download tonight.
The top reviews.
People with 4,800 hours giving it a thumbs down.
Play any game for that long and it will be a grind and you will hate it.
I have to wonder if these people just leave it idling to get their hours up.
I do not remember the last one I played.
That time we downloaded black ops and tried to crack it for multiplayer.
Oh true.
When the hell is borderlands 3 out?
fps/rpg.
I played half an our of it.
I never played the dlc either.
We kept having that lag that made it impossible.
Well, I did.
I never actually played diablo.
Maybe we should play diablo 2?
Still being updated and it is 16 years old.
Ruth davidson getting a spanking.
I never paid any attention, but from the series of short videos the bbc published about the referendum, she was very good at hiding conservative intentions and appealing to people.
But of course, that was a staged video of 30 seconds.
They were all good at that.
Nicola performs at her best all the time.
Well, I suppose 50% of people are below average intelligence. 
Well yeah, they never got 50% of the votes.
And I suppose they get dickhead votes and wealthier votes.
Freetype 2.7 released with a new subpixel rendering enabled by default.
I heard adobe are going to start releasing flash for linux again.
How can they recommend that when your hardware does not support it.
I wonder if it is in response to firefox disabling flash.
Oh, true.
Like la noir.
Hahahahaha
Jesus your internet connection.
Is it still 120Mb/s?
Is it similar to any other game I might know?
Guns?
laser deathray > bow
tiny knive machine gun > tiny nives
I saw on the steam page it said ninja is free.
What is the pay system like?
Holy shit that would be leathal.
leatheal.
No getting too ahead of me.
Rocket league is out apparently.
Okay hold on.
Listen in english, not french.
We should make one.
Just listened back to that work of art we made yesterday.
Second thursday they failed to upload.
Voice chat?
Hands up if you think hiltler house should be a genre of music.
Were did you go.
where
Why do video games still have voice animations that look like fucking pacman?
I set up a script so it shows me the time since the last upload and if our decision is in that pdf it shows me a tick.
In my bar at the bottom of the screen.
So I do not have to check all the time anymore.
Sure but at least the words match up.
Nothing seems to even come close.
I have seen realistic faces, but I much prefer faces that move realistically. 
Hi.
**late
I will sleep very soon.
:1111
I just woke up.
It is spam.
With a virus.
I hope you did not click the document.
100%
They have your name.
Any emails like this is spam.
Unless you have been in converse with a lawyer. 
Any email claiming to be about illegal downloading is also spam.
Basically, any email with an attachment that you do not recognise, is a virus.
Because some other service you signed up to sold it to spammers, lost it to spammers, you signed up to spam, or your email address is available on the internet with a search.
Bots scan through all public searchable pages to find email addresses.
If you ever have to send your email address on something, use a format like paul at lost dot host.
The best part of right now is I made dinner before I slept, but enough for two people, and now I wake up as the second person.
xom
I only did around 350.
But I got to level 260 so every one can fuck off.
How do you have internet?
It does work.
It just drops connection now and then for a few minutes.
Because it is plugged in.
You can plug it into your room to get a better signal.
Since we switched the server to use the outside cable, you can take the outnet plug from upstairs and stick it in your room.
Linksys is the router downstairs.
The router transmits the internet through the power cables and then out to outernet.
Want to voice chat and do another chapter?
Okay so you can talk to me everywhere.
Toka is home at 6pm tomorrow.
Okay so you can send me all the videos.
Yes.
Videos of you arm wrestling yourself.
Too late now?
2:18 of latest fail video.
I swear to got I was witnessing a death.
Are you awake?
Mariam.
Have you tried drawing?
I will have a shower.
I deep cleaned the bathroom.
You can draw with food on the walls.
I should have done that before showering; I am way to sweaty now.
I remember ruth davidson.
Not really.
Then ate too much.
Are they together?
I remember hmmm what is her name.
Think it begins with a d.
denise.
Too
Toooka is home.
Pfffffffffft kaizen.
Steve's fitness studio is the only true club.
Steve was the best.
Did you see damon did not win the olympics this year?
He always was.
His site said he went to rio with team gb.
Unless I missed something.
Hi.
What do you miss the most?
Personally, I miss hummous.
Not yet, been finishing some other downloads first.
Honestly, I always forget at night to swich over and download.
switch
And fuck knows how I just switched my sleeping pattern by 12 hours in a day.
I switched to waking up at 7pm to 8am.
No.
from 7pm, and now at 8am.
It is the poka engagement aniversary today.
How could you eat hummous without me.
I was sleeping at midday, now I am waking up at 8am.
Hello.
Regrettably. 
I think not.
Why do you ask?
Will you send you.
Oh wow she uploaded that.
I was messing around in google translate and she decided to record it.
My stomach really hurts.
I must be hungry.
Did you fall?
I slept.
I will go sleep in bed.
Specific?
Oh, right, yeah I knew that.
The pilot?
I number of bindings is out of control though.
HELLO!
Is everything fine?
Still waiting on a visa decision. 
They just shut from the 12th to the 18th for a religious holiday.
They are getting a written complaint after this is over.
Now.
They tell you to apply three months before the travel date for this type of visa.
They explicitly tell you this on the Irish government site.
It has been four months now.
Once we have packed up and sold some stuff.
The visa is valid for three months from around the time of issue.
The visa is not required though, so it is really to make getting past border control easier.
Yeah, should do.
Just we have a lot of furniture.
100% about leaving Egypt, sure.
I emailed our MSP about the situation. 
A long shot, but a few people recommended it.
And worst case, they do nothing.
Ridiculous I have the right to live and work with my spouse in any other country other than my own.
The Scottish government have no control over immigration though. And the British government have little to no control over European immigration.
I know you will not.
So I expect him to just take note that one of his constituents does not like immigration policy. 
After six months of working, but more realistically a year, we have the right to move back to Scotland.
But after a year I could like it there, and we could have stable jobs.
Ideally, I want to be in Scotland, not Ireland, but it is not an option to start.
She has no right to travel to the UK while in Ireland.
It would get her banned from the UK and Ireland probably.
We could swim and hide on an island.
Eat oats, and hunt haggis.
A guy I worked with had an illegal immigrant friend in Elgin.
I am sure it might be worth it if you have no family, they will just deport you.
I can come visit during that time, obviously.
That would be super nice.
If the visa gets accepted, I will mention some flight dates to see if any suit you guys.
Well, you do have secret chocolate cupboards. 
Have you been applying for other work?
How is Jane?
I am glad you are here now.
You have a windows phone, right?
There are a lot of clients so far, for such a new protocol, but none for Windows phone. Windows phone still does not have a decent xmpp client, and that has been the chat protocol of choice for the last 15 years.
I have only ever seen one windows phone in my life, and that is toka's mum.
God no.
Hmmm, I think not.
Would/could you mortgage it?
Wow, you are quite old now.
Scotland only has a growth rate of 1.4, so scottish people are going to quite quickly start lowering in population unless people start making more babies.
1.4 babies per two adults.
I was going to say, it would help if we stopped cutting them in half.
Do you think she will ever have children?
No need to answer, I will go now.
Nice to speak.
I was just restarting the computer but I was afraid I broke something.
But it is fine.
Lisa.
I can not immagine it.
I still think she should be saving the money for term time.
It is not a problem, just take care of yourself.
Is there no airgames type thing closer?
There must be somewhere in central europe.
Pffft, it is too hot.
Italy is roasting right now.
I can not wait to get an income and buy all the computer stuff.
Toka is not keen on planning too much before she gets a result.
The last visa attempts got to her pretty hard because everyone expected her to go.
But still Cork.
I mean, if we can both find work in a smaller place, that would be nice.
But all the people live in dublin and cork.
Okay, thank you.
Try to go to Ireland?
Ireland go further than what the EU requires of them and allows entry of "extended" family members. So I am sure there are lots of EU immigrants with family there.
But relatively, I wonder how many EU citizens are actually married to non-EU citizens. 
Ireland is very pro-business with it's law, which is bad for people, but when you look at the jobs there, there are plenty, but all very professional.
A little bit scary at all the high requirements.
But I there are also normal jobs.
Yeah, I am a little unsure of that.
It seems like I just have to pick a place that seems to have a good flow of employment.
Because renting will have at least a three month contract.
But obviously, I should not just pick the nicest and cheapest place.
Euro.
Think the minimum wage is around 9.20.
Pfft, it is the pound that is weak.
7.78gbp an hour.
Well, that is the plan.
Will do. Love you.
Toka's cats only poop in the bath.
But I know it is Nada.
Hi.
Have some hummous and coffee.
Due?
It has been four months.
It is due.
That was a mistake.
That was the Ireland place.
Ours is in the UAE.
And they give no current dates.
No.
Do not worry about it.
Good morning.
Why are you awake.
I slept.
I woke up at 8am.
Yeah, it all changed very quickly.
What was that song we used as an alarm one time?
OG?
What does OG mean?
The one that started with screaming.
Original.
Hmmm.
List some?
Recomended 8gb of ram.
The 360 only had 512mb right?
That is the one.
Sleeeeeeeping.
Daffy duck?
Maybe goofy.
Or cayote.
Are these even disney?
This is spam.
I take it you do not have a mastercard.
And your accounts are untouched.
You could use lisa@lost.host
Just only use it for important websites, and you should never ever get spam.
Have an email address you give to sites you do not trust. Like I have bendypauldron@gmail.com
I have never once received spam at paul@lost.host
But I do at bendypauldron.
You are being frauded m8.
What?
Do not delete any email addresses though.
You can lose access to any sites you forgot your password to.
Like a legal right.
Even Egypt has a 24 hour continious break each week.
~ua5SerK6[f;0oie)0#>B$u5<
Oh wow.
Still not there though.
Hey.
Daddy told me to take this type you can buy at a supermarket.
But I researched it and it was belony.
There was no evidence that they did anything.
Not important, they were a herbal remedy.
Not real medicine.
No idea.
People who think this stuff works when there is no evidence makes me wonder how far past making magic potions with grass and dirt in the back garden they went.
Hopefully another one tomorro.w
Looks like they are not on holiday after all.
It is a religious holiday this week.
The one where they slaughter sheep on the street.
Which puts their intelligence around the level of a sheep.
I can not wait until you are home.
There is nothing more reassuring and stable in life than the post coffee poop.
Having a port is better than nothing.
Unless it is a wine wrapper.
Mariamrimr
Have you taken no photos?
You still have time to take many.
Good morning.
Another pdf but still nothing.
Wow.
MARIAM
I am currently waking up at midnight.
DID YOU MAKE THIS
Awwwwwwwwwww.
I woke up to toka having made donuts.
They taste just like donuts.
Scummy fucks.
Claiming 3 months of coffee costs 260$.
Charging 15$ for a tiny amount of toothpaste.
Caffiene costs literally nothing as an ingredient. 
70g
Who the fuck would be interested in saving money if they buy a 2.89$ coffee every morning.
Power Toothpaste does not contain Fluoride. We know many of you don't want fluoride in your toothpaste. In the future, we hope to offer a fluoridated version of Power Toothpaste as well. For customers who want more fluoride, we suggest asking your dentist about using a fluoridated mouthwash, such as ACT, available in stores nation-wide.
Jesus, it fails as a tooth paste too.
Come back.
Changed our wireless ap from Internet to Big Booty
Are there any laws on names, because you can use utf8, and hence emojis.
You could have a giant penis cumming on a child.
Free Candy would be a good name.
Are you here.
Unlikely.
I am sure there are some small providers that are expensive.
Oh shit.
Have you ever been on a public bus when the driver gets fed up with traffic and decides to take a shortcut driving on the wrong side of a motorway?
Terrifying.
He proceeded to cut through a construction block where it went single lane and just beeped his way through.
Never been on a bus with air conditioning here.
You mean a coach?
I am excited for us to talk more.
jeeeeeeeez
Did you land yet.
Just wrote my first kernel module.
Oh god.
How can you trust 150 people not to fuck up a single inserter and break everything.
This reduces humans to stupidly smart ants.
You are home.
Will you sleep?

Money on lan?
It is not.
We went to look at irons.
Hey, how are you?
We just went out to look at irons.
And get tea.
Yes.
It is public internet with a 100Mb/s down, 50 Mb/s up.
I watched the whole two hours.
Pretty entertaining.
Might start watching the two hosts' videos.
They did it again the next day and all the factorio devs joined and 450 other people.
But the whole thing struggled.
And the client experience is no where as near as the host experience.
But it will be good for the factorio dev team to fix all the problems brought up with it.
Minecraft works like shit.
They completely changed how it all works recently.
Since we played anyway.
Minecraft never works fine for me.
And it does not load chunks in time locally or over the internet.
There is no game pause anymore.
Minecraft does not load chunks fast enough on your computers, I have seen it.
It takes time.
Nothing, vanilla takes too long.
Any time at all is too long.
I am sure Minetest works properly.
But minecraft is just fucked.
I woke up.
It is not about hitting them, it is about seeing them.
Hitting them is a severe fuck up.
Yeah they fixed all that now.
It was all fixed the update after we played.
Basically.
We should play again.
I mean last time we played they used p2p.
Mods.
We set it up to play with mods but never actually did.
I will go sleep.
When did this become a competition between factorio and minecraft?
Sleep for real now.
I thought they were shutting down.
Mariam.
You should.
But I do not think any parents here would kick a child out.
Even if you told them you were a homosexual athiest drug dealer.
Your parents are cruel because you will never find my house.
I am off to try and install something.
Okay wish me luck.
I am about to sleep.
He would never bother to come up to my room.
He would just meow from the bottom of the stairs.
Hi.
Pfft.
At least it is not humid here.
I installed guixsd.
Weird as fuck.
Come in.
The official gnu operating system.
Started doing the eudyptula challenge.
WHAT
STOP TRAVELING
I am meant to be meeting Nour on Wednesday.
I have no idea.
Probably for when I want to send a minecraft tar with all the mods to four people.
It is crazy that we use computers based on files and it is difficult to share them.
Giving linux from scratch a go.
Nour cadera.
Ohmynour
I met her before.
She came to my engagement.
And we met it a seafood place in city stars on the top floor.
With what?
A few places.
A restaraunt in city stars.
We ordered it once.
But most of the time I made it.
Looks like vector changed it's name to riot
Come back.
Come back fashkh.
Hello?
Hi.
I was meant to wake up at midnight.
But it changed.
So I have no idea.
I have no idea.
They did not like the idea?
Make another idea?
You are past me now.
Are you lazy?
Well, I literally have no idea.
You will just have to be bored enough to come up with another idea.
I am awake.
it was for irc but weechat decided to apply it to everything.
Prepare for a load of text.
I submitted an enquiry to the European Commision about the visa.
The original had formatting.
Anyway.
We got a reply 9am the next morning.
Naaah.
lost.host is private, I can use my name.
She is on here.
Fine I guess.
Just living cheap.
Because they could not solve it without legal procedure.
I am now.
Quite frankly, being busy and having too much work is not an excuse to be break law.
They should be traning and employing more people.
Or, you know, doing the work themselves, instead of outsourcing it to some proccesing facility in the UAE.
I need to register to vote by post, but the post here hmm.
Leave me at that address though.
You have to be registered somewhere.
Water has been off for two and a half days.
We called them yesterday because the neighbour opposite to us has water.
So maybe it is just this side of the building.
They put someone on the job.
The person called up and said they have to do something at a station.
We called later and they said it should be fixed.
This is a person who needs fired.
They pretended to do something because most of the time water comes on again after a while.
Jesus.
Which fruit is it?
You revived it from the dead.
Are you home?
Mariam.
We have not had water for three days.
Me too.
We are hoarding water.
Shower we went to toka's parents' house yesterday.
Face we pour a little bit of water into a bowl.
Dishes was a nightmare.
And the bathroom stinks.
And I have not pooed in days.
Apparently the owners did not pay the water bills in forever.
And 9 of the flats bought private pumps.
So now they turned it off and forcing people to pay their debts and buy private pumps.
Because the communal pump will not turn on until everyone has paid their debts.
By which time, the company has sold 24 private pumps.
Which is corruption.
And the company is owned by the government.
We are trying to call the landord because it is his responsibility. 
In every other country it is illegal for a water provider to turn off water.
And it is always the landlord's responsibility to provide electric, water, and gas connections to the house.
Here, the law is not available online.
Oh.
I just did.
Wow, took you days to reply and you reply mid upgrade.
I have not had a message from you in four odd days.
I just update to synapse 0.18 and vector-web too.
Yeah, I noticed that right now.
The symbol looks like two seconds in mspaint.
Huge step backwards.
Riot is stupid too.
Is this another cat?
No.
We can not get in contact with the landlord.
Started to apply for some freelance typing jobs.
I will laugh at the first sucker to pay me to type.
We got chocolate spread.
I am now.
Are you ill.
Wow, two worlds on linux.
I might too if it is 64bit.
I actually went over our download limit last month.
150GiB.
At 200KiB/s.
Quite an acheivement. 
Hi.
It starts too early.
Morning.
Who is she.
The only female friend I know you have was in the photo in france.
I did update the matrix server yesterday.
But I doubt it has anything to do with that.
When will you send all the photos?
Mariam.
Come in.
Your face looks much rounder here.
Or younger.
Did you draw any more?
Well, we still have no water.
But now the landlord is trying to fix it.
But four and a half days.
Hi.
Maybe there is an update.
Wake up.
Is she a princess?
Hello?
Still no water.
Why?
Maybe tomorrow a plumber will come.
Cat princess?
It is time.
Marmiamia.
Hi.
When do you wake up?
Is it university?
Wow.
I wake up at around 9am.
Wow, nice.
Ah, yes, because I did not complete the tax year and they charged me average as if I would.
I need your help.
You need to answer the home phone and give me a number I think.
Should be phoning any second.
It did.
Not sure right now.
Did I leave my national insurance card there?
I did?
Wow, that card is old.
Okay, you should probably delete all those photos.
Bit of a risk keeping them there.
Okay.
Thank.s
I finished the procedure.
They should have it in my account soon.
At about midnightL.
You are never home.
We almost have water.
Any minute/hour.
We got it.
The moment toka's students arrived.
It was the first time they saw me.
I cleaned the bathroom and some dishes.
They changed the name.
Stupid if you ask me.
Also the logo is so dumb compared to the last one.
Finally got the private water pump installed.
Six days of no water.
I answered the door and they had no idea.
Well let me shower and have all the dishes and floors clean and I will tell you.
I told them to come in but they were too scared.
I feel bad letting even a tiny bit of water waste now.
I told them to come in but they were too scared.
I think they knew.
I guess because I hid every time.
MARIAM
HELLO
It is Novo Amor time.
And super cleaning time.
And COFFEE TIME.
Toka finished the class and went to meet her friend who failed an exam for the second time.
HOW ARE YOU.
Cleaning everything first.
I bet mummy has no idea how dirty a toilet really gets.
Okay. I cleaned the bathroom floor and did some more dishes.
Now I make coffee.
Will you send you.
I will have a marioffi.
No sleep.
They knew I existed, but I always hid in the room when they came.
So they were probably shocked to see I was a real person.
Or normal.
This is the best song.
You look bored BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT MEETING ME.
Come back.
Coffee break time.
Okay first laundry load done.
What is she studying?
Try six days of poop and pee.
After living on about 10L of water a day, using 10L every time I go to pee feels like a crime.
Hahahaha
I never paid much attention to the princess stories.
Or any Disney story.
I just went to test my typing speed now.
I did 591 characters in 60 seconds, with 0 mistypes.
I think I have finally hit 120wpm for one minute.
My fastest ten seconds is around 150wpm.
And my fastest 60 minutes is 92wpm or something.
I do not do 60 minute tests that often though.
I do not go full blast for the whole thing.
Had the last coffee as celebration.
Oh, no idea.
They said 3-5 days.
Not really urgent.
That money will be used when we travel.
:D
Who knows what could happen before December.
Still quite a while away.
Have you been drinking at work?
Are you there?
Dishes round three done.
It works all the time?
I thought you were home.
Maybe I did.
Did you get the update that changes vector to riot?
Stupid name and stupid icon.
Do you ever update things?
I bet you can not wait to see me.
So I can hack your 3ds and you get the freeshop app.
It lets you download any game for free.
With open source applications, the changes implemented between versions are issues reported by users themselves.
I guess you have to.
I am listening to lots.
I wish we could have a few hours alone to listen to music.
I managed to download 150GiB last month on a 200KiB/s connection.
I made sure to get the large download, low speed package.
I got the lowest speed I could stream sd video on.
2mb/s.
For 120egp a month I think.
Third laundry load.
You should not confuse types of internet.
What we have is a 'fixed line' connection.
Which means we have a physical wire connection to a telephone exchange.
Any connection that does not use a wire will be a mobile connection.
Provided over a completely different infrastructure. 
It does not matter if you turn any of those connections into a wireless signal once it enters your house.
fixed line connections are way more reliable, cheaper, and such.
Time for more dishes.
Dishes round three finished.
But no.
Why.
That is mean.
Did you give her sleeping pills?
The sleeping beauty?
Hahahaha
Is she sleeping standing up?
I think she is pretending.
That is cute.
But I bet she keeps back-up knives in case her cute disguise fails.
Well, time to clean the kitchen surfaces and the hob.
It feels good to have water.
It feels clean and fresh.
Sleep well, Mariam.
Good morning.
We will go to a 2.5 shop to get a icing bag to make those fried cake things.
What is it?
I am home.
Hi.
I am waiting for the students to leave.
This is you.
This is when we meet.
Wow, together.
Toka's started today.
It happens when the pill strip runs out.
You take pills.
Why do you need to track it?
I know I know.
Okay next Saturday meet me at city stars.
Not this Saturday.
Because you will not be perioding and it is the weekend.
But I will settle for any day.
Kind of.
But I would be scared to tell the driver to stop.
I would rather go somewhere I can walk.
Okay, let it be your mission.
Drifting time.
I would rather walk somewhere by myself.
Are you a cavoman?
UGH MARMA UG.
Right, sorry, clue.
HEY YOU
<3
Why are you not asleep?
We are making the fried cake things.
Balahshame.
Prove it.
Yes it is too sweet.
It turned out very spongey.
Chocolate would make it way better.
Good morning.
It is Toka's parents' day.
They made misa2a3a2a
Hi.
Only bread goes with hummous.
I am home.
Babaghanoush meets balahsham.
babalahshanoush.
And factorio dropping 32bit support.
We did but never really played after an hour or so.
I remember we had to make accounts.
Expansions are still being released for that, right?
I think we should give starbound another go at some point.
I played it a bit after we played and it was very different, and I think that happened again at some point.
babahuma2a3us.
I remember the ui was better.
And there is a mission quest system that was very cool.
But I have forgotten most stuff.
I must have misremembered that we played together.
dmc type game?
So so sleepy.
I liked chaos something.
Chaos legion on the ps2.
Jesus, 2003.
Yeah.
Bayonetta 2?
Is 1 old?
Oh, you are wii uing it.
Non-Stop Infinite Climax
Oh, shit, I know this game.
Saw a really good video review of it.
High skill ceiling, right?
I am poor though.
As in my money is lacking.
Although, I did get 170gbp tax back because I did not finish the tax year.
Which means, I have still paid 0 tax.
Do you like seeded bread sticks with chocolate halawa?
I only bought about 7-8 games for the Wii U.
About 30 for the 3DS.
There is another game on the Wii u that the reviewer praised for the same reasons as this game.
Had something to do with lots of little things.
Wonderful 101.
Same developers?
You should keep an eye out for Pocket Jockey reductions.
I think you would like it.
No idea how much it is.
But as someone who can pirate any game on the 3DS I have a hard time reccomending anything for purchase.
Battle cats pop is also fun.
And Picross 3D 2.
I feel sick how much money I spent on that.
3DS games.
I am so sleepy.
Wake up.
Yeah.
Ignored it.
No idea how I got away with that.
I can barely type.
Hi.
It finally slept without my hands.
But still on me.
It just meows when I put it in the basket.
We managed to convince it to drink some milk.
I feel like I would have a hard time talking to people on the jury.
As in determinism.
To be fair you job is to just decide if the evidence is sufficient to conclude the truth of the accusation.
Not to decide if they deserve anything or if it was their fault.
Ewwww murder bad.
Xom
Toka got a job today. She seems happy.
The cat had to sleep in my hand all night.
But now I tricked it into sleeping on a teddy bear.
It is hiding completely under the bear now.
Are you home yet?
Did you hear about our new cat?
It is a newborn.
Two days or so.
Some cat gave birth and abandoned one of the kittens for a day and a half outside our flat.
It was meowing constantly and loud.
I went down to see what the noise was and it was in the bush.
I thought about moving it away, but it would die.
I took it to the flat and now we are trying to keep it alive.
It is only two or three days old.
No idea.
It was screaming for a day and a half outside our window.
I went downstairs in the morning to see what was making the noise.
And it was just there alone.
We washed it twice.
No idea.
Yeah, I was going through top week.
Hey come in.
Hi.
We went to the market for some stuff.
Do you have classes on Thursday?
Yes.
I am staying up a little later.
I am a little cold.
Mariam.
Please be there.
You need to be.
Are you there?
I need help.
Three days ago there was a squeeking noise outside our flat.
Very loud.
It went on for over a day.
I went outside in the morning to look for the noise.
It was an orphaned kitten.
It had been squeeking non stop, all day and night.
At this point I felt like I had three choices, to move it to another place, to kill it, or to take it in.
I took it upstairs.
We bought a syringe to feed it but it was hesitant to drink anything.
I had to stay awake all night with it in my hand in bed for it not to squeek.
Yesterday we tricked it into staying on a teddy bear.
But every while it would climb up high, fall off, get lost and squeek.
I had to wake up every hour last night to put it back.
Toka went to work this morning.
I was already really annoyed and angry at it from the past two days.
It would not stop squeeking and so I decided I had to get rid of it.
Stop.
I could not just dump it outside though.
Because it would starve and rot and suffer for days.
I can not stop crying now.
I tried to break it's neck.
It is dead.
It's head came off.
It was terrible.
I panicked.
I am a shaking mess though.
I know that it did not suffer during the death but I killed a kitten.
What is toka going to think.
I can not lie.
There is blood on stuff.
But I can not look at it.
I was angry at it during the night though.
It constantly squeeks.
It leaves a safe comfortable place and falls and squeeks.
It continiously does this.
It's whole three days of life just seemed like suffering.
And with no mother to get milk from, it would be very weak.
I mean every time someone buys a chicken from the supermarket, they are responsible for a chicken's throat being slit.
But they do not bat an eye at this.
Doing it myself, to a kitten, it just feels like murder.
I did not expect the head to come off, it fell out of my hand and rolled away.
It's neck was squirting blood.
I was trying to open the window and it would not open and eventually did.
I threw it.
I was trying to call toka but no answer.
I tried to call her before it happened but my phone was nowhere to be found and it was stressing me out more.
I would have came back to the same thing stressing me out.
It was so annoying.
I never wanted to take it in in the first place.
But I could not kill it or move it for the same reasons.
And because I did toka would think I wanted a cat.
Animal shelters do not take in strays or newborns.
There are more stray cats than cats.
She was pretty excited about having the cat too.
But she might not believe me.
Especially if I miss a spot of blood.
I do not think I could live with keeping that a secret.
She will just say it was crying because it had no mother.
And the only detail she will see is that I removed it's head.
Mariam.
I did a terrible thing.
I killed the kitten.
Please do not ask how.
I can not stop crying.
Toka is at work and she is not answering.
I did mean to.
Choking would be much worse.
I talked to my mum about it but she thinks I should lie to toka about how it died.
I did try to break it.
Five hours.
Mariam, I killed a kitten.
No.
I can not lie to her.
But the truth is horrible.
The reason I took it in was because it was annoying me.
It was squeeking constantly for a whole day.
And I could not just move it or kill it.
So I took it into the flat.
We tried to feed it and comfort it.
But it would keep falling and climbing away and squeeking.
The first night I slept about 30 minutes.
hi
Last night I was waking up every hour to put it back to the bear.
This morning it would not stop.
How could I know it was suffering?
I am not an expert with kittens.
It's entire life was causing me annoyance.
Mariam.
I tried to break it's neck.
But it did not work.
And there is not return from that.
So I had to do it harder.
It's head came off Mariam.
Because then it would starve and rot and suffer.
I have no doubt what I did was the most ethical.
But it is the most horrible for me.
When I decided I was too annoyed to keep it, my intention was to put it outside, far away.
I put on my clothes and shoes but I stopped to think.
And I knew it would be way more immoral to dump it.
But this one is three days old with no mother.
It will die.
But I did it because it was annoying me.
Who really knows if it was suffering.
Before.
It was about two hours ago.
After it happened it was still moving and blood squirting.
I can not stop crying.
I just ripped a kitten's head off, Mariam.
How can I relax.
I will try.
Maybe, but maybe it was not.
Maybe it just wanted to find it's mother.
Yeah, we have had kittens.
But toka was also living with this one.
She will say it was scared.
And then I just ripped it's head off.
It is never going to seem like enough reason.
My mum does.
But I think she will doubt it.
Lying about it seems like something that would eat me inside.
I have to wait another five hours.
I think she was excited about having a kitten.
Which makes everything worse.
I do not know.
Maybe.
But she will say after a week or two it will calm down.
What am I meant to do now?
I have to clean blood from stuff.
But I do not want to look at it.
Four and a half hours.
Way too long.
It already has.
I am but it is already pretty hard.
Toka phoned.
I told her everything.
But she can not accept that I did it.
Or that it was the right decision.
So this makes me no better.
Toka phoned.
She would not say it was the right thing to do.
And she can not believe I did it.
So this is not good.
Okay.
Great.
But you do not think it was right so you do not think it was the most ethical.
Probably not.
I do not want a cat.
Toka does I think.
I do not want to see a cat.
I do not want anything to remember what happened.
I managed to get the blood from the cushions, sofa, and curtain.
Washing the stuff the kitten pooped on.
It was really hard to get out.
I am way more worried about toka.
And how she will think of me.
I doubt I will be killing any other things.
I do not keep people's numbers.
Maybe but I lose all the numbers all the time.
I am not sure.
She seemed in denial that I could do such a thing.
Xanthum gum or the chickpea water you said.
I think Holland and Barrett sell egg replacement powder.
She has not spoke to me
Has been since six.
Well, Toka has not spoke to me.
Mariam.
I always want you here immediately.
Hello.
Just woke up an hour ago.
Need tea.
Fine but Toka is at work so who knows.
She is moving out of your house?
Not really.
Oh yeah.
I should make another one.
Can not be as bad as Jane's house.
It was, but she does not live alone anymore.
Jeez.
Pasta.
Just made it.
Added chilli to it this time.
Eggplant, pepper, and tomato.
Some vinigar, garlic, black pepper salt etc.
I should do.
But I have not yet.
I have not checked that.
I know.
Not a chemist.
I know where one of the shops is but I always forget.
Maybe the bread.
Never made lentil soup before though.
It is pretty far.
They do not have supermarkets.
2km or something.
We will go next time we pass that place.
The lentils and stuff we need to get from a market on fridays.
You can buy them in shops but they are more expensive.
1.4.
I know.
I do go out.
Jesus, 25gbp for a tub.
For 100.
Not going to get those.
A chemist might sell 20 capsules for 2gbp.
We are speaking now.
But I just have a feeling she will not think of me the same again.
A bit.
I did on the phone.
I would rather never talk about it now.
I think she hates me.
She has not touched me.
I hugged her and it was not mutual.
Twice.
Mariam.
:(
Like I do not want to sleep.
Why are you awake?
Eight DP cables.
Mariam.
Where did you go?
You fell asleep at the university?
Me.
A lot of internet?
Want to play factorio at some point?
The multiplayer code is insane now.
They were hosting 400-500 player games.
Come in.
I think she still hates me.
Is in 2-3 hours good?
Okay.
Why are you spelling words wrong?
Are you using a dumb phone?
8k at 120hz.
No no.
Pasta again.
Maaaaybe.
Not really.
Only the last two days.
What are the ingrediants?
When will you go to bed?
It seems like something that is more difficult to get right.
Seems exactly like bread.
I just need the yeast.
Sleeping on the job, as usual.
Night night.
I started writing a minimal matrix client.
So far it connects to the server and logs in.
In about 20 lines.
Hey, did you end up learning much C?
Or do you just know how to printf?
You are at work.
I am in a programming mood anyway.
Just tonight started a minimal matrix client.
Yeah.
I started with libcurl and managed to log into the server in about 20 lines.
But obviously that is cheating so I am switching to just using libressl now.
Going to make it much like ii.
The author of ii made a frontend that is brilliant.
C++ is disgusting.
Here is some funny text.
The interview is worth reading.
And here is a post by the guy who created and still mentains linux.
Are you asleep.
Spoken like a true 2ker.
I do want a high high refresh rate monitor for fast games.
But for everything else, well, it is 30fps video and mostly static text.
And for the fast monitor, unless an new tech comes along ips is just too slow, so I would just go tn.
240hz tn 1080p monitor for stepmania basically.
But first, a iris 580.
Why does it say 15.73, and then 3.57?
On 3G though?
No point in 16Mbps if you can not download at that speed for more than a few hours.
Your upload is twice our download.
Why are you awake.
8 what?
In scotland we had 90Mb/s.
And we lived in a small town.
Ben lives in the capital and gets 240Mb/s.
The problem with the internet is not so much speed.
Imagine a road from here to alexandria.
And we want 4000 trucks from alexandria to cairo.
Let us imagine we have 4000trucks/s internet.
This means the road is very very wide and all the trucks can fit on the road at once.
The problem with the internet is that no one has real directions.
So I need to send someone out who has no idea where alexandria is, but just has an address.
They reach a petrol station and they ask if they know any other petrol stations nearer.
And this happens about 25 times.
Then they arrive in alexandria.
And now they tell the 4000 trucks to come back to cairo, but they have to find the directions again.
And then there is the problem with congestion.
Because the roads are share.
And sometimes trucks go missing.
And when you put too many trucks on a road, more go missing.
So congestion control exists.
It stopped the roads from getting jammed.
But it also slows down everything.
So instead of sending 4000 trucks, it sends 8.
And when the 8 get all the way back to Cairo, I send a guy out to tell alexandria that I got all 8.
Then they will send another 32, and when I confirm I got all those, they send more.
If some trucks go missing, they will resend those trucks, but also not send as many trucks next time.
Just one problem with the internet.
I would find this person taking photos very creepy.
HEEEEEEEEY
Maybe she had chilli on her fingers.
When do you get up for university?
But you said you had a class when I asked.
It is not a public holiday if the public do not take a holiday.
I am just brushing my teeth.
Yes.
I am now.
I will fall.
Goodnight maraik.
The 8k is.
Wake up.
I need tea.
For gaming.
But all the games I play it could handle 1080p.
Since my current GPU does a fine job, any improvement is a bonus.
I imagine the 580 can play most games at low at 1080.
Maybe I could finally play Skyrim.
My CPU does struggle with games too.
My computer is so out of date now.
Do not worry, soon I will have an iris 680 to fantasize about.
Cheaper than a 100gbp discrete.
And better drivers.
Yeah, I was thinking passive next.
For linux.
Yeah, they are.
But they beat the open source alternatives for amd and nvidia.
No way I am getting a skylake with it's built in rootkit though.
Not really, more demand for windows drivers.
I may be wrong, I just saw three or four game benchmarks.
Could just be those games.
I have not used the intel drivers for 2d in a while now.
They have around 25% better performance.
But it is nothing I notice.
And they have the DP bug that makes using 60fps 4k unusable.
I think most development is going towards gallium and modesetting.
I can not find which package owns it.
And I need it.
I have no no idea why anything is closed source.
The only reason I can think is because their code is shit and they want to hide it.
Or they have something bad in it they want to hide.
I mean, even just open source.
They could make it non-free and not allow anyone to compile and modify.
I guess it has something to do with money.
Anyone who can take the decision to open source stuff in these companies, just have no idea what code is.
Or not going to gain money.
What are you doing?
No, never cancelled anything.
Are you double sure?
They will probably charge you double next month.
Or they made a mistake and you just never talk about i.t
Do you have a binary called mabm?
whereis mabm 
Google search has become useless in the past month.
I can not even google what it is.
oh wow, it was a typo.
instead of -mabm
Dressing in sports clothes?
I was wondering why most my updates were failing because a missing mabm file.
Will you do any sports?
Pfft.
We had a sandstorm here once.
And obviously I played darude sandstorm.
400mph.
If you mean metres.
The national hurricane center says a max sustained of 140mph right now.
WHY ARE YOU EXAGERATING BY 10%.
Also sustained only means 1 minute average.
TRY LIVING ON JUPITER
384MPH
Plus, Jupiter is just a lot of gas so you fall in and get crushed.
It might be toka's parents' day.
When are we meeting.
fan tribute.
It sounds like the voice actors.
Did you see the crazy theory about rick and morty?
Trying to find the theory.
The channel did a follow up video too with more evidence.
Mariam.
It was not parents day.
Mariam.
Test.
Going to try out an IRC to matrix bridge on the server.
Which would allow you to connect with irc clients to what looks like an irc server, but really is a bridge to synapse.
Using weechat kills my soul.
Just the fact that matrix is a plugin for it.
And it supports plugins in x different languages.
Yeah.
With history and all.
I will try it first and tell you if it works well.
Trying mainly because there are 1000 irc clients and 2 matrix clients.
Are you going to give civ6 a try?
Looks like a nice improvement over 4.
The multi tile cities makes it look great.
Was just watching TotalBiscuits initial thoughts on it.
Not finished the video yet.
the bridge is being a bitch about compiling on openbsd.
I take for granted having a great build enviroment because I am on gentoo.
Obviously it has everything installed that any software could ever need to compile.
Looks like I will not be able to build it on openbsd.
I will build it locally and host locally for just me.
Bit like bitlbee but for just matrix, and not as ircy.
He said the game is the first to feel like it is worth playing over the previous game plus all it's expansions.
Wow, has communist government type.
Mariamriamrimarmm.
Did you get stuck playing stuck in the mud?
pto claims to be a tiny statically linked binary.
It is 20MiB.
And required three hours to compile llvm, then rust, then cargo.
Then it failed to compile because the build script told it to download the latest versions of the dependencies and compile.
I had to check the build logs to find the exact versions they used.
Rust is officially the worst language experience I have had.
Go did all of this but it actually worked, took less than 10 minutes to compile everything, and actually produces tiny static binaries.
Of course it crashes and does not work too.
Are you dead yet?
Pffft tampa is only 18mph.
Why do these speeds seem very low?
Looks like matrix started the same project.
Why rust.
Maybe she is.
Hello.
Switched to using Go because I have wanted to learn Go because everything about it impresses me.
Also because it has strings, utf8, static compilation, and a huge standard library with json and https.
Should make this a breeze.
Fuck it, writing my own ii/ratox/sj style client in go.
I tried in C two days ago but without using libcurl, fucking arount with openssl, https, and json parsing was too annoying.
Go has an insane standard library.
Jeez.
That is around toka's yearly net pay.
If you want to follow my progress.
Going to use your chat as test spam.
Jesus.
Have you been living under a rock?
Nah.
No idea how it is always right.
There are a lot of very clever things going on with go because of the people working on it.
Currently have it so it lists matrix rooms with names / members.
Next will be making a tree file structure for the rooms.
!WLCGbSDGxiXnmFEtbg:lost.host : @Charlotte:lost.host!ZAnySTuEvcfmuINgiE:lost.host : Meredithish!fRPTZFzcPcqPbrrAmQ:lost.host : @lisa:lost.host!KXaFEmJhMiduzOuTOA:lost.host : @mariam:lost.host!NnLICOyktLcFVYjttv:lost.host : @ian:lost.host!iISiYtuCGlCVnXHVIi:lost.host : @currfyg:lost.host!ZuzEIhvDmaPIjkMhDD:lost.host : @toxic:lost.host!RmkAUQFJdhYxTpLIOp:lost.host : guuuuuuhhhh
You are an exception because I think you named this room.
Or this is a room and not a private chat.
Who knows.
Still, fucking sweet.
Here is the matrix client I am writing.
It currently authenticates with the server and gets sync data, gets which rooms the user is in, and creates a directory structure for the rooms.
So this room will be /home/paul/mm/lost.host/@mariam:lost.host
And in this directory will be two files, "in" and "out".
The program will keep all our messages in out, and make sure they are all there.
And to send a message to you, I just write a line to the in file.
And then the program will be finished.
Good morning.
I want that robot walker.
No but I am sure it has.
It went in.
Tea time.
Research progress is saved when switching now.
That was to make mmo possible.
Did you see the mention of infinite research?
Think this is referring to it:
"i can confirm that its hella overpowered in the very late gameMy bots currently move at over 1100% speed and carry 10 items.Lasers doing 100 damage per shot.
"
Nah, that is a mod that implement it.
Might be worth it.
Unless you want to do the bob's mod route, which we never started and was insansly complex.
I mean tea tea.
I did that, and the messages are written to disk, you can see the structure I went with in the README
Next I will do sending messages, then receiving messages, then sending message receipts, then maybe look at things like reporting my presence as online and offline.
The program is only at 136 lines.
I want it less than 250.

Test spam 2

Shiiiiit, I have receiving messages.
Getting better.
She is working a lot though.
Yes.
Except I hated civ end game tech.
It never seemed to do anything.

I have read receipts and presence events.
Also support for getting message types like images, locations, etc.

I have the pipes working.

WHAT IS UP FINALLY
Okay, program is finished.
Not aware of any bugs.
But I am sure they will arise.
Had to use background threads reading the fifo pipes, which in go is wonderful.
Should be fully functional now.
I departed from how ii treats output with a single out file, because the nature of matrix is syncing history, which makes sense when every message is a file.
So ii tools to use it will not work.
I will probably either write some shell scripts to interact with it, or another program.
Once I do, I am sure I will notice bugs or places that need improved.
Mariam.
I finished the program.
Yeah, I think it was a bad choice.
Well, you can call me all the time then.

I checked up what is happening with the game.
Sony seemed to be responsible for the problems.
The team had no PR person, and sony never gave them one or any help.
The team have said they plan on adding features after all the bugs are fixed.
But they also do not communicate, and stopped even publishing patch notes (even though things are changed).
They said actions speak more than words, which is lazy.
And that is all.
I always laugh when I see a prelaunch trailer.
Mariam.
Come in.
Yeah that guy was a dick.
Hi.
HELLO TOKA

Nope.
I split the file into two.
One just full of the structs required for parsing json data.
It is 60 lines.
And I just cut down the main file by about 20 lines, let me see.
main is 168 lines with 5 or 6 that are comments.
So that is 228 total.
Got to cut down so I have enough space to fit in full history syncing.
Windows is one of the only oses it will not compile on because they do not support fifo pipes.
I considered sending messages by creating a file in a folder, but that requires the kernel implement something like linux inotify.
Which is probably more rare than fifos.

Outputs like this.
Each time a new message is from a different room, it will create a new title so you do not get confused who is talking to who.
Not really a fan of every contact having their own window / screen.
Means when you are sending messages you will have to prefix your message with who you want to talk to though.
Might write a dmenu script for it.
Sending from dmenu.
Holy sweeting sweet.
Alt+m in dwm now brings up a dmenu list of all my matrix rooms, I can type g for gary, press enter, and it gives me a dmenu prompt "gary:", I just type my message and bam.
I finished everything. I wrote a short shell client to view all the messages, and a very short thing to send messages.

Toka got a job being a university representative (basically), but the university changes all the time.
Her manager took everyone out for dinner on the way home from a school visit today. So now I will eat ALONE.
The company is paid by universities to scout out clients.
So they help students give all their money to foreign universities.
No, she seems to like it. But I am super hungry.

I could do with some tattie scones.
I should really try making them. How hard can it be.
Made a pretty balling client and dmenu script for mm.
I think I might have tried it once, 50% mashed potato, 50% flour, fried it up.
Are you sure they did not take it? They might just give you ebills. You know that the money has not come out of your account?
I might see if I can find the account details and log in online to see the bills. But not right now.
The direct debit did not fail because you did not have enough money in the account, right?
I never remember the account details.
This never works for me, always says there is a technical glitch, always has.
Not sure, the problem is they lock you out for a while if you get it wrong three times.
You might have to phone them. If the email address is paul@eternal.coffee, that does not exist anymore. Maybe just get it changed to cmeredith71@gmail.com and ihavearedcarpet
I remember one time they tried to change my email but when I logged in, they fucked it up.
Do not mention the bills though haha. 
Because you forgot your account login details and want to change them. That is reason enough to phone.
Some things are, but they also let you resign a contract, so you clearly have power too.
As long as you have a bill number and account number, that will probably be enough.
You have paper bills from ages ago, right? You can just say you have been on paperless bills for ages and no longer have access to the bills because you do not have the account details.
Also, I never signed anything on paper, just verbally, which I guess is why they let you "sign" the other contract. I wonder how that contract stands up in court since they do not send you a copy of what you are "signing".
Got any tips on making tattie scones? I might try tomorrow.
Maybe when you see the ebills, there might have been a reason you got credit with them so they are using up the credit first.
You might have overpaid over the months, some clause, or legal decision could also refund you credit.
Grate, not mash?
Think I will do cook and mash first, seems more reliable.
Nah, the bills will tell you what are going on. No need to bring it up.
Not sure about flavouring. I want the good old tattie scones from tesco.
Seems easy. I imagine they are all vegan though.
Mariam. Are you ever awake.
If they turn out tasty, then yeah.
He used butter, but I guess a little oil will be fine.
Been getting into monster hunter generations. 
It is pretty nice to pick up and do a quest or two.
No Man's Sky is 32% and 12%.
Oh wow, I never realised there was a version on the home console.
An NX version would be great.
Any time I play a game on the wii u, I want a 3ds version, I think the same would be said about monster hunter, but still, I want the graphics and controls.
Nope. Not at all.
The news you mean? I do not care either, I kind of trust them not to fuck up.
New nintendo consoles tend to get flamed by everyone until they have it then they love it.
The wii u is probably just as underpowered as the wii was.
Compared to the hardware at the time.
Not yet.
I am sure there are going to be enough poor kids stuck with wii us in a few years time.
And shrek 16 will be released.
Check out a list of ps2 games or gbc games.
Games kept getting made way way after they should have for some reason.
Nope.
That seems more like not enough development time. Looks like a trick to fake a reflection, but fucked up.
Sure I have no idea how AAA games are coming out with gaping problems on every play.
People who walk through objects and objects that clearly clip others. How much time do they put into this stuff?
Yeah, but program less, save money.
I heard no man's sky got the lowest rating on Steam. Not sure if it is lower than starforge though.
Starforge is 15% positive.
2% positive in the last 30 days.
So that thread was a lie. But still.
Which was unity?
Oh wow. Yeah, I followed the dev videos for that update so when it did come out, I already knew the features so it did not seem big to me.
The videos got long and boring though.

I think misa723122( looks better.
Toka got 30 B12 1000microgram things for 1GBP.
Yeah, it is, so hurry up and use it with me. I have had zero problems so far.
I find babagangagngoujjjjougha tastes bad after you have too much of it though. Unlike hummous.
Looks like you bought the most dangerous phone ever made.
Have you ever taken any sublingual pills?
The cheapest B12 here is 1000mcg sublingual pills.
They were causing me to panic as I was waiting for it to disolve under my tongue.
I feel like I was violated. 
I had to sit there for about five minutes as my tongue tingled and it was being absorbed through my tongue.
I would be much more comfortable with a suppository.
The taste was strong as fuck too, and you are not supposed to swallow it.
I press alt+m to get a dmenu contact list, then a dmenu prompt for a message.
The right is just a short shell script that uses mm.
I always close chromium and when I open it, I never remember to open vector.
I always had weechat and newsbeuter open. But now the 170,000 line piece of shit-chat is no longer.
Yeah, but 5 minutes of saliva, some gets to the top of the tongue. How often are you taking B12, and how much?
I used to take 100mcg every two ish days. I would have done everyday but I always forgot.
Not had any since I came here.
B12 as medicine here is cheap but as a supplement, 100 pills any strength for 30GBP. As medicine, 30 pills for 1GBP.
Mariam, wake up.

HELLO
I do not have nas.
Left a little prematurely.
Forgot now. Why do you need one? Do you even have a gigabit network?
What the hell, just buy an external ssd.
Or get two internals and run backups.
I run a backup every 4 hours here to an external 4TiB hdd.
If your connection is fast enough, just use lost.host as picture backup. It has two 256 840 pros with backups every 4 hours or something.
Any important data should not be on a hdd, jeez.
Jesus christ, do you want the photos to die?
That root partition is a 128GiB ssd, feels like a waste.
If you want local previews and shit though, use your own setup, I no longer serve samba.
But no doubt use lost.host for anything you never want to lose. Unless you have a more reliable setup.
Cheap as shit these days. I remember buying a 40GiB ssd for double that price.
Why on earth would you buy a sata drive though? Get an nmve pci-e ssd.
I am never getting another sata drive.
Oh, laptop. Well that drive will outlive your laptop by about 4 years.
If you only casual game, get a nuc. Never had a computer I liked more than my nuc. And the current ones are about double the cpu and gpu power.
This is the new form factor. Way way way faster.

Bill date is the 26th of each month.
The bill issused on 26th of september says: Your payment will be taken from your account on or just after 10 Oct 2016.
Ahh, I know what is going on.
All bills are paid, including septmember's.
26 Aug 2016\t-146.23
In August, the bill got a -192GBP adjustment, and the bill for that month was -146GBP after -24GBP tax.
So for what ever reason, they decided that you had overpaid by 192, or they gave you 192 because of something.
You got 2.5 months free credit. So next month they will take nothing too, then you will pay 10th of December.
No refund to your bank, but you do have credit in your bt account. Another month's worth.
Yeah, bill will happen on 26th of october, payment would have been taken 10th of novemeber, but it will be 0, next bill on 26th of november, payment of 73 on 10th of dec.
phone is 18, internet is 41, not sure which one include the line rental, the rest is tax.
Yes.
Might be getting opengl 4.0 for haswell soon.
Who ever you go with, also do not pick anything without talking to me, they need to provide a static IP.
It is very unlikely the price others advertise at first is going to include line rental because in cities, often you can not pay bt line rental if the isp has their own stuff.
*is not going to include
I just have to read the t&c, privacy policy, check for static ip, the speeds, limits, and then check to see if the isp spies.
It might just be cheaper to downgrade the speed on your current package. But who knows, will check when the contract is out.
Tea time.
Where are you.
Yeah, I mentioned. They also are thinking about just stopping the s7 altogether.
A plane was landed after one caught fire.
Actually, use elementary os. It is beautiful.
Sent a complaint to the European Commission, Ireland are breaking EU law, we should have had the visa 3 months ago. Nothing we can do if we do not take Ireland to court.

We are not talking enough.
I am making potato scones.
Maaaaaaaaariam.
I made them and oh wow I missed them.
Going to let the last four cool and see if that makes them harden up.
Mariam, someone from the matrix team found my program and asked if they could add it to the list on their site.
Made them better, not sure how to make them even harder though.
Letting it buffer while I finish another video.
Installing windows 10 in qemu just, well I have no idea.

Some aweful theme software too. Transparency everywhere.
Unless you want Arch.
Toka's private she has with two guys around 21.
If it is difficult to understand code, obviously it is worse code, but zero is stupid.
No, I gave the whole class.
What did the code do?
I will check tommorrow.
I think the plan is to switch over gradually because toka works now.
Wow, this is 5-6 lines in c.
There was a matrix thread on r/linux so I took the chance to post my program.
Some guy asked to add it to the list of clients on matrix.org.
I said get to fuck you little shit, I will have you know I graduated top of my class in the navy seals.
Anyway, both the chat client, and the dmenu script are both POSIX shell now.
Which along with making the config of them easier, was what I wanted before anyone tries to use it.
I have been a gentooer for quite a while. I gave it a whirl and now any time I try a binary system, and vim requires X11 and 15 libraries, I piss a little.
Actually being able to make use of custom compile time options is the best.
But if you just want something familiar and quick to setup, arch.

Maybe these children are entitled because they fit the requirements, but it used to be that ANY child born here was given citizenship.

Want to play a game the rest of the night?
Been a while since we voice chat.
Oh, maybe starbound.
I am down for both of those.
Not sure, will need to update any of them. Still have about 30 minutes till toka leaves so I will get starbound.
That has been the one I have not played for longest.
I know it has a lot of content, but terraria is only 300MiB.
I have factorio installed but there is always an update for that.
Starbound is going to take 60m.

I wonder if parkitect has multiplayer.
I know the stable has save game compat with all updates.
Unstable was for breaking save game compat.
Of course.
No, that is a different game.
No mention of multiplayer though.

I was playing a game with Ben.
Are you staying up late?

I want to eat taymeayatohoes but I do not want to make any right now.
Played for a bit, went around collecting resources. Got enough to upgrade some workstations.
And an oxygen backpack.
Tomorrow will probably be around the same time.

Yeah.
Did he die?
We hung out in the same group. He was alright.
Nah, not michael. He was pretty quiet.
Short?
Or skinny.
I might fall asleep. Some cunts with hammers decided to start smashing up the building this morning. I only got two hours sleep.
Oh, well that was underwhelming.
Usually when you bring people up, they had a child, got married, or died.
Today was toka's parents' day, tomorrow is nothing.
Well, I am going to sleep while it is quiet.
Wake me up if anyone dies.
I will sleep now because last night, well, noise, hammers, that is all I will say.
I woke up for a moment. I will be up five am or something so just message anytime tomorrow.
I woke up for a bit.

I found a place with a shit tonne of ore.

I got some muscle relaxant pills and they help a lot.
Just started season 6 of Lost with toka.
Good morning.
The medicine makes me soooo sleepy.
How many do you have now.
Muscle relaxant.
Yeah I better.
Well, my back hurts because my neck.
Hello?
I just sent him a message.
Yeah.
The only time you hear from me is when you send me something.
What was he making?
Could do with some soya sauce noodles.
I am about to make misa7a2a.
No, wheat noodles.
Nope, toka wants me to watch it but I saw the trailer and description of episode one and I just could not.
Nooo, the thickest wheat noodles possible.
People say it is realistic, but I will be able to see the screen and know what is happening. It would kill the immersion.
I should really start making the food before toka gets back though.
So I will leave you for now.
I guess so. Toka is going to buy me an iron to do her clothes for the morning.
I am taking over the private english classes she does.
Nothing on the visa.
I took the first class a few days ago and should be another tomorrow.
Still looking for some typing work too.
Toka picked up another, slightly wealthy private class too.
Okay, food. I am super hungry.
My neck went again. Toka's mum had some left over muscle relaxant, I have been taking that, but it makes me so tired and drowsy.
Nope, it was all in English.

Yep. Just slept for 15 hours.
I woke up. I slept forever.
They are okay right now.
I just slept for 15 hours.
WHO SAID THAT
Second heart coffee.
What leaf?
Jesus.
What the hell.
I only have tea.
Yeah. Have not slept that long since I was 19.
Some of toka's friends came around and they are noisey.
Just finished the class though.
She will shut the door if you want to play.
Mario Party star rush.
Hmmmmmmmmmmm.
I am staying up all night tonight.
Toka's company owner wants to meet me for some reason tomorrow.
But there is no way I could wake up that early.
Are you alive.
I am too cold.
I am home.
I have not slept yet.
Actually no.
Have not slept yet though.
How the hell is that stack cooled.
The 512 is not tooo bad.
Why is it so cold.
Pokemon moon and sun demos.
Mariam. Have we met yet?
He wants to save money in his computer stuff.
She should be able to find a book on fortran in the tombs.
I can imagine this exactly.
Just be lucky she did not leave you a present.
I just woke up.
What were you doing on the nintendo subreddit for five hours?
Not going to look at anything either.
xom
hi
hi
hi again
It is a test.
Yeah.
Am I everything you expected?
Did you faint?
Cold is any time I want to put on more clothes.
Sooner.
You can ask him how we will meet.
You always fall asleep.
Sure, hold on.
I made tea.
The white balance is a bit red.
The private class is not today so I do not have to write up notes right now.
Are you sending a photo?
I did. Mariam was happy?
WHY
How could you wait a whole two days without sending you.
Jesus christ, 60GHz for 802.11ad.
Is this not going to get fucked by walls?
How much does 2.4GHz defract?
I always just assumed defraction was a large reason for getting around buildings.
Will we have a photo a day.
Penetrate/get fucked.
We are making "the literal magic"
Fankoosh or something.
What was that upbeat genre with brass and singing that you liked?
Ah, ska.
All food here is too oily and salty.
Much better now.
Yeah, that does sound good.
When will you wake up.
Do I need to splash tea in your face?
Wake up wake up wake up.
Shit. How many hours is that? 2 more?
inb4 intel iris 580 pro.
Well, it would wake you up.
Wake wake before I THROW TEA AT YOU.
I went to bed.
Shit, what did I miss.
Calls are not working...
Oh, I know why.
Hold on.
No audio device.
Fuck.
Hi.
Gerund is from latin gerundium.
The nintendo switch?
Or the new referendum proposition?
Hi.
Wait, I took a photo.
Yeah, me and ben were waiting for the launch.
It is perfect. Everything I could have hoped for.
Buy me one pls.
My sister is on track: "Omg, did you hear?"
"Nintendo switch or referendum proposition"
"Nintendo obviously."
It will probably be the same as the wii u, 250 or 300.
Well, you did not send me all that hype this morning for the referendum.
Mm, proposition.
We need one each, but buying games is expensive.
No need to buy it, just never upgrade the system on the 3ds and I will hack it when I visit.
Save the money for a switch.
Did you see in the trailer how the controller splits into two, and there was a new mario game in it too.
Fans are always the first thing to break.
Tomorrow is going to be pretty busy too. 
I will get don't starve downloaded though.
I own it on steam but fuck steam, which version?
I might own it on gog, who knows.
There was loads of expansion stuff.
Nope, it is old.
I added file support to mm. Now it gives me a direct link to the file, the file type, and size.
Oh, wow. You called your sister a bitch.
I just booted linux with a broken kernel command line, so I had no display.
I switched the kernel to the old version, without any display, in qwerty.
I got two new t-shirts.
Yeah, on steam it was a standalone game.
Yeah, got it queued for tonight.
I have emoji (noto font) notifications in my dwm bar for when certain channels upload new videos.
I have a warning sign for when my internet is connected at the wrong speed.
And a radioactive sign for when my petabyte porn collection is decrypted.
I have to wait till toka is ready.
Yeah, I looked up the water wiki page for egypt, they massive majority have "enchanced" drinking water or something.
Which was the standard set above just not going to kill you water.
I looked it up a while ago so I forgot. But almost everyone in urban areas has clean water access.
Not sure about flouride though. I suspect not. 
Just saw the title and now jewlumminati and global elite make sense.
The air seems like a much much bigger problem.
Toka has made donuts before. They where good.
Yeah, almost all donuts are vegan.
I know the co-op ones are.
For fuck sake, gg is down.
I slept for twelve hours.
Wake up.
A load of the internet seems to be having problems.
Getting cloudflare messages on loads of sites.
Finally got a 10/10 score on mail-tester.com
I have SQF auth, user auth, a valid DKIM signature, passing DMARC tests, reverse dns matches the host name, the local hostname is valid too.
So it should never ever be sent to any spam mail box.
I think that is a permalink actually.
Mariam, mariam, mramiramrimarmrm.
Is it even possible to use a non-gog version?
It has the account sign in system.
What is wrong with the GOG Complete Edition + Shipwrecked DLC?
Ah, but gg just went down again.
This one?
We both have valid accounts.
I am guessing it is just accounts, and not drm.
Nintendo ids, drm free ticket system.
Just waiting for gg tracker to come back online.
Scene release so double raring expected.
Has not found any peers for me yet.
Tracker is responding though.
It found one now.
100KiB/s.
In 18 fucking peices.
Install libcurl with gnutls enabled.
Is it 32bit?
The program file tells you.
file dontstarve_steam
29 minutes or so.
13
Read?
Did you check if the game is 32bit?
No, run the command I told you to.
file /usr/bin/top
/usr/bin/top: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped
An example.
Did you get mesa 13? No idea how the current drivers perform against the proprietry.
There have been big improvements recently with the kernel, mesa, nvidia, amd, and intel.
All three have opengl 4.5.
But improving.
70fps running on what?
Only a proprietry benchmark can put 70fps into perspective.
For me, I have no idea what a 760 is.
I have no idea how many fps any of these cards should get in xotonic.
Or he does not own every graphics card.
The site he runs allows people to submit hardware benchmarks.
So that site should have many more results.
mesa nvidia is split into multiple drivers for different generations of cards.
The benchmark has to be nvc0 vs radeonsi.
Looking for unigine results with multiple modern systems.
I have no idea how to answer.
Crimson either sucks balls, or?
Why the hell is he using wine?
I am happy enough waiting for open source intel drivers and intel graphics to progress to play games.
I have no idea, it is weird.
Yeah, nvidia still seem to suck.
It rang on my phone.
Could you hear me?
Did you run out of ram?
Call me.
/usr/lib32/libxcb-dri3.
I mentioned it.
Yes, I am using the camera every day.
I look the same every day so you will get bored.
I predict an hour until I am ready to join again.
Did you make those donuts?
Hellllllo.
I would save and stop now.
I got that set up.
Do not want to lose it.
Damn, no.
Going to get tea and then I will play.
Bit of a trek though.
Are you alive?
Ready?
Well, after checking every day for results, it got less and less hopeful.
So I sent a complaint to the European Commission.
They agreed that Ireland were breaching EU law by delaying the process.
They directed us towards a law section specifying exactly how long they are allowed.
Two weeks, or four if they contact the Irish authorities.
Still no result.
Toka got a new job helping students apply for universities in the UK.
I am going to the south of Egypt to work a week for the owner.
They need some English speaker to be the front of some new English centre they are opening.
Oh, sorry.
I really have no idea.
It could happen any thursday.
Of course Egypt will let her leave.
There is no restriction on that...
And there has only been failed national visa attempts, for visits.
To the UK.
With the such long delay, I can not but help it be on the back of my mind now.
But if it does come through, it could be a bit disrupting.
We would have three months to decide to leave.
Not unless we live in another EU country for six months and the UK is still in the EU.
Well yeah, but if the UK has left, we will have no chance of living in Scotland.
If the Irish visa comes through and we can work there for six months, and the only thing I would worry about then is the UK illegally delaying her application so that the law changes and they can reject it.
Or we learn dutch and live in the Netherlands under a shengen visa.
Yeah, the thought of moving to the EU is risky and uncertain.
But also a door that could shut.
I have talked to Toka. I have heard your advice. But, respectably, I would like you to live six months here before you advise living here longer. I understand your point for basic securities, but you are not aware of the problems living here. 
Look dad.
I understand your concern.
But you are jumping to so many conclusions.
First of all, to think that toka and I are not reading each others messages to each other.
The UK is changing, but to call it the worst it has been, this is an insult.
Have you ever read labour history of the UK? Or anything about the development of capitalism in the UK?
It might very well be the worst during your life, and this I have no doubt.
You growing up when labour unions started taking power of the country.
And now we have Teresa May. And eight years of conservative rule so far.
And listen here, just because you have lived longer, does not mean I can not read a hell of a lot in to politics and history.
Who the hell said the EU is currently in a mess?
The EU houses a massive number of the most developed, well off countries in the world.
When the UK starts having a double recession, this just means the economy has deflated two quarters in a row. It is still most likely a bigger economy than the year before. But oh no, fucking panic and doom from every news outlet.
To call 10s of thousands of refugees into the UK a crises. How many refugees have you met? There are 60 odd million people in the UK. 
Egypt has a population growth crises.
But it is not a crises, it is just life.
The news just loves to call everything a crises.
And when I start hearing normal people using words like 'in the current climate', it boils my blood.
They are literally repeating what they hear on the news.
Have you ever took the time to look at the sources for reports? Because they very often plain out manipulate the truth.
In Ireland, even in the very worst case scenario, I do not having nothing.
Everything you are typing is a hyperbole. Everything is just blown out of reality.
Do you not think I take time to research things before I decide?
As a UK citizen of my exact situation, I am entitled to 200gbp a week job seekers allowance. And housing support. In the very worst scenario. And every decision I make about Ireland is based on the assumption that I can not get a single penny support.
And while we are here, I am sick of people thinking they know anything about visas.
The number of documents and law I have read regarding EU law and UK law is stupid.
And then people think they know better or I know nothing with an argument like, "but you are married".
You told me not to moan about my situation. I was not moaning.
You were moaning about immigrants. And you sounded like every other person who blames everything on immigrants.
No one said I was unhappy, no one said I can't do it in Egypt any more, no one said I would be ashamed.
No one said I have no money, no one said Toka does not have money.
We are doing just fine here. No one said Toka is desperate to leave Egypt.
I know the importance of money. 
You do not need to repeat your point about surviving and money five times.
During university, you have no idea how poor I became.
I was finding pennies to afford half a loaf of bread. I was cooking flour in a pan. 
And when I see you going on holiday all the time and buying food because you like it and not because of the cost.
And then you complain that you work all the time and have no money.
You tell me that if I move to the EU I will be homeless. I would not have a roof above my head.
And here is one of the worst sentences you made tonight, so I will break it down. Because I was astounded at the logic here.
"Given the previous failed attempts and the delays". There have been zero failed EU immigration attempts. There have been zero failed EU visa attempts. To equate UK national immigration law to EU is absurd.
So we can take this to be, "given the delays I think you... as and adult".
Okay so you think if I do not agree with you, it would make me childish?
And finally, the conclusion of the only valid premise, "given the delays", " you have to maybe accept it that the EGY goverment will not allow her to leave."
I mean, really?
That conclusion is completely false. The government have no problem with her leaving. And even if she did has a delayed Irish visa application, they still would not care if she left Egypt.
And then you used this argument to tell us to stay here. 
One sentence back and you said, "realistically the visa will not happen at moment right?".
The visa could happen at any moment. As if using the word realistically in your sentence made you the down to earth person here.
I am not going to get into anything you sent Toka.
But please, as your son, I want you to start respecting me a little better.
I am perfectly aware of my situation. More than anyone else, in fact. 
I appreciate that you are trying to care, and to give good advice, and to look out for us.
But if you want to express what you did want to express, say something along the lines of, "Paul, I am worried about the situation you could get into by immigrating to Ireland or the UK. I, personally, feel like it is getting harder and harder to meet ends meat here, and I worry that you and Toka will be no better off in Ireland. If you are living fine in Egypt, perhaps consider living there a while longer until things look a bit brighter."
I can take your concern like this. And it will be on my mind when I make decisions.
But how you did it today was a total disaster. 
You keep telling me to think about it. Over and over. As if I do not think about it.
As if I have not thought about all scenarios you can come up with.
When it comes to thinking about my life, I am the one who thinks most about it.
I do not want to look up the average quality of life of immigrants to Ireland vs our current to prove something. I do not want to look up statistics on immigrants to the UK. I do not want to look up employment rates of unskilled labourers vs non-arabic speakers. 
You did not look these things up when you tried to use them as warnings, and neither will I.
I just want you to express concern without throwing in all these mishmashed, unsourced reasons.
You are my dad. I can take your word for things. I can respect you and what you say.
I did not reply for two hours, I just did not know how to. I was just going to accept it and leave it. 
I went to Toka and she got an equally long message. I was still just going to leave it.
I came back and you were still going. Saying the same thing. You told me, "for god sake, think".
If you know how much money we had, if you just immigrated to Ireland, if you had lived in Egypt with us for a long time, if you had calculated budgets for living in Ireland, if you looked up social support and immigration law in Ireland, then you could mention this.
But the only message I get is, country mess, immigrants, think, no chance, no money, no prospects, immigrants, think, going nowhere, mistake, do what is best, no income, simple.
And finally, given all the messages I sent while we were talking at the same time. You addressed none of them. You came with a message to give. And you wonder why I was not replying? 
Mariam.
Are you ready for a long read?
Give that a skim and tell me which one of us is crazy.
Well, toka is not here right now so I can not show you.
Mariam.
He is out of order talking like this though, right? It is liked he just realised I would be an immigrant, and all immigrants are doomed and the problem causing his dire lack of money.
I was in a bad mood and I just could not let it sit.
You should see the message he sent Toka.
He some how thought that I would not read it. So he said things like, "my son is VERY narrow minded. This is not a bad thing... but"
Toka knows how hard I will stick to the truth. If I am uncertain about something, I am open to help to figure out what is true.
Half an hour?
Okay, cheerio.
I need tea before my head explodes.
A cup. I said yesterday night I need tea and toka was so confused.
Tea is cheaper and closer to our home.
I use loose green tea leaves. A big box for a pound. 
And I add quite a bit of brown sugar.
Toka hates it, but then I hate black tea too.
I drink black tea without sugar. Not keen on sweet black tea.
But brewing very strong green tea, brown sugar seems to help.
She is just pretending. She is really in bed.
He just got me angry. I could not believe he was making so little sense. 
He said to toka that he got all his wisdom from age and experience.
Of course, it is going to be a week or something until he logs back in.
Yeah, I have tea now.
Well, judging by the local produce here, check for eggplants, sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, and aubergines. 
Pretty much all they have right now.
But their tomatoes and cucumbers are just up to UK standards.
zuchini, not aubergine.
Aubergine is a eggplant, right? And zuchini is a courgette?
Just making tea.
No idea. What did he want?
Who the fuck said I was not listening?
I pointed out he was not replying to me. 
I replied to all of his points.
He needs to step back.
What was it?
Oh my god. Toka said exactly, "I am not as keen to leave egypt as you think."
Because he was spurting about he know how much toka is desperate to leave.
Toka was trying to settle him by saying we are staying in Egypt... for now. But left out the for now clarification.
Why do I have to deal with people who hear one thing and conclude something different?
Of course. But it is not the end of the world if we do not.
Yeah, I have listened to him enough.
He better not be pooping.
I guess it is his room now.
Toka is going out and the class is tomorrow, so I can play in a few decaminutes until 10 or 11ish.
Are you dead?
Mariamrimarmiarmimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Got any further plans or time estimates?
Why are you so saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad.
Did you sleep?
Wake up.
Call?
I slept six hours.
Toka made those before and they were fantastic.
Come in Mariam.
Making a tetris game in go now.
I went to bed at seven.
Bin man woke me up.
Alarm is set to go off in four hours.
You sleep too long all the time.
You have been saying it for years.
Hi.
If you are up late and want to play, just say.
Page 5
Page 10 too.
Yes.
They are the only real choice.
They own all the infrastructure in egypt.
We are on the 2mb/s 150GiB.
we had an unstable connection for a month, I complained, nothing was done, has been completely perfect for over a month now.
And by unstable, I notice when the internet connects at the wrong speed, or disconnects for a minute in the middle of the night.
I would say 2 per person is good.
2 is enough to stream videos.
Hahaha, good luck reaching it.
Unless you are tactically setting downloads over night.
They have a very nice website you can log into and change speed / limits / check usage.
mytedata
One.
It was very very fast.
Will you send you.
Honestly, the program I wrote is perfection. 
Nope. Not unless you run linux / bsd / plan9 / osx.
I wrote it for me.
I am making a text based tetris game now.
And I have fool.
Too late. I finished.
Eugh I miss toast so much.
We do not have a toaster and grilling bread is not the same and there is not sunflower/olive/soya spread and there is no good seeded sliced bread.
Toast is a british tradition.
You can show me this.
I do plan to send a photo today, but it is not the end of the day yet.
Do you like pen drawing?
I quite liked doing it because to shade you had to use denser line patterns.
I know the song.
I want my piano.
I have a fully working game of tetris in 201 lines of Go.
It has rotating, random pieces falling from the top, coloured blocks, line clearing.
Of course I want many more things like levels with speed increases, scoring, next piece preview, hold piece, hard dropping.
Holy fuck. Worst brain slip I have ever done. Just noticed this piece of day old code:
I must have been tripping serious balls.
Are you musicing?
No no why mariam why.
Less coffee for you.
I got scoring, levels, next piece preview, and a full working UI. In 290 lines.
How?
Still around 21 here.
28c, but I started wearing my onesie.
Ready, just making tea.
Hello.
Uh-oh.
What did your parents say?
They both want the same religious sites.
Why did you?
Ah yes. Is it nice?
Are you here.
I think I remember reading about jews on the wrong side of the border also being forced to move.
Shit, just sent a jew message to an arab by mistake.
That was for ben.
I remember reading about the people that got cut on the wrong side of borders. And they were practically forced to leave.
Well, they lived fine together before shit hit the fan, but when shit hit the fan, living together was not as possible.
Just think of all the immigrants with uncertain futures in England.
And England is not exactly shit hitting the fan compared to 1948.
Pretty sure if you look at the UN partition, it was not 40%.
I can not really find any information about the demgraphics in each state.
I guess compare to the planned border.
There is a timeline of proposed borders and actual border changes somewhere on wikipedia.
The arabs were very stubborn, yes, but the israelis also acted over the top.
For sure some shit going on there. 
The should just fucking live together.
They both believe in the same god.
Yeah, either inconsistent or constant moving going on.
For an israeli state to even have a majority population of jews they would have to gather and expell.
It says the planned Arab state had 10,000 jews (1%), and the planned Jewish state had 407,000 Arabs (45%).
Haiti (Vote: For): The promise of a five million dollar loan may or may not have secured Haiti's vote for partition.[79]
He said the Zionists had tried to bribe India with millions and at the same time his sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, had received daily warnings that her life was in danger unless "she voted right".[76] 
Jamal Husseini promised, "The blood will flow like rivers in the Middle East".[85] Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said, said: "We will smash the country with our guns and obliterate every place the Jews seek shelter in".
I fucking hate them all.
No idea why so many countries deem it their problem.
Britain just got the fuck out.
We should just encourage any citizens in that area to leave and let anyone willing to fight, kill each other.
Provide homes for the all in whatever country they want to go to.
Not like providing homes for a few million people is too hard.
And then bomb the shit out of the religious site.
They would still worship the ground it used to be.
Yeah, this is what I think will happen, the arabs will out populate the jews.
The percentage of people who care about this in both sides is also dropping.
Exactly.
I would take those stats with salt, since the stats on the uk also suggest the uk is pretty religious.
77% of Israeli Jews believe in a "higher power", wow I thought all jews believed in a god.
Not a jew if you do not practice judism. 
Just an israeli.
35% percent of christian scottish people no longer believe in a god.
Rangers vs celtic is just the queen vs the first republic.
A kid kid?
A random thrown glass, or an attack?
It must be on video somewhere.
Person should get a punch in the face for throwing glasses.
Who the fuck hangs around people who throw glasses in the air?
Smashing glasses is for egyptian street kids.
Remember the Archer episode where he is running across russian roofs and there are two kids just smashing glasses?
His reaction to those kids is so real it is crazy.
I will see if I can find it.
Yep, you beat me to sending it.
Every time I see a kid smash a glass I want to take a glass and smash it on their face to teach them a lesson.
Free Swiitch for every kid.
xom
Talk tomorrow.
Are you hungry? I watched ratatouille and it was good.
YOU MAKE ME SO JEALOUS.
I reduced the game to 246 lines.
My favourite thing about coding is finding stuff to get rid of.
What.
Maybe eww. But I want any right now.
Loaf of bread.
Sometime we get a long loaf of uncut bread from the bakery near our house and slice it at home.
Sometimes
Sleep more mariam. Slemoriamepe.
Wait.
217 lines now.
The last one is a valid mp3, the first one is uncompressed audio.
I can not be responsible for your phone unable to read the two most common and widespread audio formats.
It works on the web version if you check next time you are on your laptop.
CAN YOU NOT CRY TONIGHT
Yes.
Going to call after I pee.
Hi.
Little problem with my usb.
How long?
Just made potato scones right now.
Until 5am your time.
Tomorrow I should be free in the afternoon too.
What?
I go to bed at 6/7pm every day.
Better this time. Toka was helping with the frying.
Okay, that time is good. Just send me a message when you are ready.
I assume local time.
It is homemade POTATO SCONES.
The ones on the left have cheese inside for toka.
Oh you look very formal today.
Ready?
What is going on?
I still have twice that many.
I will have some more.
Did you hear my audio recording?
Made nes Tetris in go in 280 lines.
Ready?
Struggling to connect to the internet.
Yeah, hold on. Funny how?
??
Hi.
I have not, no idea who toka talks to.
Made potato scones again yesterday, did mummy show you the photo?
The left half have cheese in for toka.
Show me a photo.
Are they sweet or something?
Bread is life.
I am a multiseed guy though.
You should get mummy to get the oat rolls she got me and have them with nut cutlets / the mushroom burgers she got me.
A bit.
It is a gaelic/welsh pagan tradition.
Did one attack her?
Yeah.
Did he die too?
Oh my god.
Is it online?
Oh wow this is going to be good.
Was he cheating with mummy?
Or is this after?
Who cares if he is watching porn all day.
Yip.
Am walkin.
Yip.
I have to let it buffer a bit but I just heard him speak hahah.
Everyone watches porn.
Keeps buffering.
Did mummy watch it?
Did she react?
HE TOLD THE TRUTH
HE WALKED OFF HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
The way he walked.
Jeez, very early.
Cheerio.
Ben, you are going to love this one.
Remember that guy my mum dated from glasgow that I told you about because of his accent?
Yes.
It is not so bad because he is speaking short sentences.
But the way he walks off stage was class.
It is the same guy.
I laughed so hard.
He is not too bad of a guy.
Just hard to get past his speech.
The whole show is disgusting.
Often they blackmail them to follow scripts they write.
Pretty sure it does.
I have one in it.
Let me double check.
What?
I have a sandisk ultra 64GB xc in it.
Formatted with fat32.
Seems a bit arbitary.
xc goes way higher.
2TiB or something.
Because they have said it is not a 3ds successor. And they have not mentioned anything about wii u / wii compat.
Or do you mean from switch to switch?
Mariamrimarm.
ARE YOU GOING TO SEND ME EVERYTHING
Did you hear the audio yet.
I can.
I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD JUST SLEMORIAMEPE
I am going to try to make a gif of the tetris game running.
Okay that does not really work.
Will you send you.
Did you fall.
Today is toka's parents days who knows if I will be on.
If I am it will be the evening or night.
Correct.
What is in the patch?
Yeah.
I will check out a comparison when I get home.
Are you okay.
What is aunty Mary's story?
Just something I do not know.
Mummy is here.
Well, I have been here since half two.
And will not get home for a while.
What are they?
You will have to photo then.
What is wrong with John?
I sewed my trousers button back on.
It just means traditional or something.
Still waiting for a photo of a Glasgow roll.
What happened to seeded bread.
Took me a long while to get comfortable with them.
I can help if you want.
Not home yet though.
Around 5am UTC.
It is a big 2u server psu form factor.
Speak of the devil, danielfromsl.
So probably every arabic country.
Make that 1UTC, wedding tomorrow.
But any other day, 5UTC.
Why. Why do you have dinosaurs.
Stop risking your life.
I can not get 5m towards a seal.
For higher wages or what?
I think I saw USA prisoners were striking.
Tomorrow is a wedding, might be able to play in the evening, not sure. If not, tomorrow is the end of the weekend anyway.
What is aks?
No wedding sucks more than your own.
Maybe the desert people.
Forgot the name they call desert people.
Wake up.
The bride was British.
What is mung dahl?
And you mean mango flavoured green tea or did you miss a comma?
I was.
It was okay. I met a lot of people because half of them were british.
I have real mango juice in the fridge and green tea but I guess a flavouring works a lot better.
Or some dried mango with extract.
Watching the Trouble by the waterside daniel video and wow he makes me laugh.
"Trouble by the waterside" where he tries to rent land on second life.
My rss reader told me it was new. Maybe a reupload or something.
The bride was British.
Not for you.
Have you met me yet.
Make me an assignment.
I had to wake up early twice this weekend so I am very sleepy now.
No no, I am making noodles and fateer.
Will you?
I slept for 12 hours.
Should be ready just after I wake up.
Are you alive?
The switch is 4GB of ram.
Pfft, a synecdoche.
No factorio?
xom
I have not been on a scale in forever. But I eat a lot, seriously.
It is just not having spread. 
Eating spread my mass stays around 68kg, without it it stays around 62kg.
It always is. So many cats no one will ever care for.
They are too irresponsible to take it to a vet.
I would enjoy any roll at this point.
The wedding yesterday had some proper rolls.
I have not seen the photos yet.
I eat more oil here, a lot more, but nowhere near as much as spread.
Fifteen minuteish?
Did you see many photos?
Now>
Come in mariam.
Hi.
I woke up.
Are you fine.
Oh, you are awake.
Will you listen now before I sleep?
There is BE-BPL-3-Multi-choiceA, should there be more documents here?
Mariam where are you these days?
I am typing an egyptian arabic learning book.
I just typed for 3 hours. This must be a record.
I was just listening to some old recordings.
And one of the oldest is one from maha on my birthday.
And I am going to play it over a song and send it to you.
It was the perfect music for it.
I sent her the recording before I had the idea of playing music.
But she has not replied in forever.
Tom Day - Descending.
In the last two years, we hungout once for an hour or so. And that is the only time we talked.
I sent you a WILD song two days ago.
I wish we could talk. You told her she could email me but she never did.
So this is sad.
You better not become Mahariam.
I will get into bed. But I will stay to talk if you want to.
As in on the phone.
Toka's alarm went off the moment I entered the room.
Yes, she is showering.
Stop with exams and studying. It is all for nothing.
Oh one thing. Matrix has account level notification settings.
If you log on the PC and disable notifications for a contact, they are disabled on all devices.
It might not be why. Maybe update riot?
I doubt that will make a difference.
I hope it works forever.
I showed Toka it.
She said it is really nice.
A perfect time for a photo if you ask me.
If it has mirrors on every side you can take a photo of forty of you.
Your eyes are never bad to look at.
Toka left too.
I wish I could sleep forever.
If you stop responding.
Mariam is not responding. Would you like to stop your process?
I hope so. I just hope they work.
Hopiam.
Notifiam.
Are they lemons.
I know. I could sleep much longer but I needed to pee and I was going to bed to late so I should get up early.
I have to go get food.
Looks like someone is being notified.
Is the word for spiced, mahowig?
Just going to buy some food and then I should be ready.
Come back. I got cucumbers, fool, and bread.
Okay now your eyes do not look like you said.
New leaf update info tomorrow night.
Oh I know that coffee, it is what the devil drinks.
Did you listen to this is maha again?
You should tell me every time you do something you could not do before.
Which ones?
I met an Iranian girl and we talked about Iranian films I like.
She was married to an English guy.
Ah, very good films. I have still not seen the third one.
Did you photo anything.
Yes.
The version I sent?
I think I already have told you. Fireworks Wednesday, The Paste, A Seperation, tThe Circle.
Past
A few others but I do not remember.
Will you eat?
Why are you not hungry?
I actually stopped getting ill. I guess because I stay alone a lot.
Whatever makes you happy.
A bad thing that alone means no me though.
I am indifferent.
Okay fiiiiiiiine.
Okay you can wake up now.
I am. But I will be in ten minutes.
So no sleeping.
I eat way too unhealthy.
I just miss my hummous.
Just woke up.
Hello.
I was meant to be ten minutes but I accidentally fell asleep and slept for 14 hours.
MARIAM <3
Oh wow I hope you were not at the front row. The front row was always my place.
And I would micro sleep.
Did you make them?
I wonder when minecraft will be updated to use vulkan.
I remember one of our professors calling someone out for sleeping.
Where are your not bad eyes.
What the hell, new leaf got the updated furniture arranging touch system, and an new camp site, and minigames...
I expected just amiibo support.
You play the minigames on a wii u console in your house.
You did not take a photo?
Are you home and alive.
Nope. I am dead.
Mariam.
Things I have noticed: daily quests, image sharing to social networks, a new currency for doing quests with special items to buy at the camp site,.
But the best one is probably the secret store room which is a new room for your house for storing collectable shit.
Have to wait until tomorrow to see it though.
One moment.
Mariam
It is the article that starts the leaving negotiations with the EU.
Once it happens there is no turning back.
But the high court ruled that the government have to consult the parliment so it could be blocked if 15 mps are willing to defy the referendum result.
Which could be likely.
I just told you what that thing was.
About a year or two of negotiations.
Yeah, I told you, the high court decision.
No, that says the government must consult the parliment before doing it.
Are they new friends?
Did you get the new leaf update?
Do you need any axes?
What are their names?
Will you be up late now?
I thought you slept all the time and at random.
When did you fall asleep?
Did you fall asleep again.
I should be up for another three hours.
Is it music night?
Hello MARIAM.
Are you downloading everything?
Did you watch the first two yet?
Did you cry.
I was told the third was not so good. 
Nope.
Okay now it is music time.
Only if they are good.
This is the best arabic singing I have heard yet.
I do not like Mashrou' Leila though.
Singing, I think.
It is harder to find nice singing than nice music.
No no no no no no.
There are zero male arabic voices I like listening to.
And zero songs with habibi in that I like.
Everything I hear in Egypt makes my ears bleed.
Arabic, but in general, there are not many male voices unless it is a duet with a female.
I do not consider any language beautiful.
I judge the voice as an instrument. 
The words and meaning are nothing to me.
My tumblr does not exist.
Here is a song that no one knows.
It is a little boring but probably the best I have found today.
Way too repetative.
If I wanted depth I would read poetry.
Do one thing, and do it well.
The voice is really annoying.
I am looking for folky upbeat music.
I need to pee.
I send these after I hear the first ten seconds and I like it.
I know this song. And with 5.2M views, I think everyone knows this song.
I think I have it downloaded or something.
Or it would autoplay after a song I would play on soundcloud.
Heard it way more than I want to have.
Oh, I think we are on to a winner here.
I am just hoping for a nice chorus now.
Are you off tomorrow?
Then you can be up as late as ever.
Oh, I wanted fool tonight but I forgot and it is still frozen :(
Okay, I have a queue of 10ish albums and eps downloading.
ARE YOU IGNORING ME BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME FANCY PANTS MOVIE
Does it have food though?
I have began learning Arabic again.
Today I learnt imshee, oota, 5yar, 3eishe, and hmmm other things.
I have no idea how to write them in franco. I can just say them.
walk, tomato, cucumber, and bread.
And na7la is bee and naxla is date palm.
I know quite a few random words.
And similar ones like oota, 2ota, and oda.
Okay it is my bed time.
It is super cleaning time.
Hello.
Get the beautiful town ordinance and you almost never get weeds, and more importantly, your flowers never need watering.
The update is pretty cool, adds a store room which is a very large storage to your house, and it adds a very cool touch screen way of moving furniture.
And other things, but they can be a suprise.
I am good. The room is clean.
No need to update unless some serious shit is added.
Mariam.
Hello.
How is your sleeping.
I tend to sleep after a while.
It is very cold.
I might have to put a tshirt on under my onesie.
I missed tea in the afternoon and now my head hates me.
What are you doing?
Is it guy falkes night tonight?
Wake up.
Yeah, typical really.
It is credecard, but it is not a bank.
If you want, you can delay my birthday and christmas and in March get me the new nintendo switch :D
Lisa might want one too.
Probably, yeah.
Did a big clean of the living room yesterday.
The amount of dirt :S
It is all dirt that comes from the air outside.
Not yet.
Toka's parents gave up a large plate of deserts so eating that up.
Toka brought home hummous :)
Wait, the round ones?
The rice crackers?
I found out I can block all calls and texts from numbers not in my contact list.
So now I will never get another spam message from vodafone because they sold my information to companies who want to advertise.
Have you heard of Westworld?
Have you watched it?
Giving it a try.
Factorio?
What?
If you want to play more, I can in twenty minutes.
Are you alive.
Did an exam shoot you?
Okay that is it.
Yeah, no idea what you are talking about.
Change of plan, tomorrow is no factorio, today is.
MARIAM
I will do dishes and make food.
I made tiny pasta with cucumber, pepper, and spinach sauce.
We started watching Westworld, I recommend it.
Wanna collab?
Oh when did you start, where are you?
I am staying up all night.
Come back.
I will be home in 20 minutes.
Not sure when you wake up.
I am home now and I should sleep.
But not until you come back.
Hello.
What are you sorry for?
I went to bed.
Woke up now but toka will be home any minute.
Tonight, though.
Yeah  I should have 4.3 but I have no idea why it says 3.3.
I still have it downloaded.
Haswell is gen7.
Ah shit.
I guess I just missed it.
Are you an android?
Weird things happening to you like deloris.
Xkcd fail today.
New gog connect games.
Nice, I got huniepop and starbound.
I got a steam key for starbound from humble bundle, then steam to gog.
I am okay. Which episode are you on?
Hello.
We watched the diving bell and the butterfly.
I will show you which one later.
Okay, now on a scale from 1 to 8.
Energy (1 - slow, to 8 - quick)
Speech (caring to direct)
Facial Expressions (flat to varied)
Mood (serious to light)
Overall (unique to normal)
Come back.
We are waiting.
Apparrenttllyy a new launcher for linux minecraft. 
Hi.
Speech, 1 is saying things carefully or lying to dance around people's feelings, 8 is just saying what you mean or the truth and not caring about their feelings.
Nope, I found people judge themselves very differently to how I judge them.
So you can.
Wish I had risk of rain.
I waited a thousand years for your return.
Why did you?
Yeah, there is a lot of nudity. Penises and vulvas everywhere.
Hmmm I do not know the male word for vulva.
There is not on in english but there is in some other germanic languages.
Volvo in Swedish.
Which one.
Why were you sad and nervous?
Just use university for what it is good for: meeting new people and not working.
I want to see you code.
I want to see stuff you write.
It is too long for my liking - 550ish lines.
But it has some pretty advanced tetris stuff in it.
I think golang is the only language I like other than C and x86 assembly.
I do.
It is the US elections today.
Are you ready for the Trump?
I hate C++.
Good luck.
Ready for the US elections?
Did you fall.
Did you see the new 3x3 WR?
Yeah, what the fuck are you doing awake?
Hacking Tesco?
Last minute Clinton campaigning.
Up all night from banging david shorter's mum?
I think Hilary will win, but they are both shitty people.
Hello Mariamiatta.
1fps on my computer.
Are you finiatta?
Jesus, is btn on its last legs?
Some interesting things here, like ColoradoCare.
Probably, the US is not thaaaat bad.
8 million.
Oi, noggeroo.
Mariam.
If you are busy, mind running the factorio server?
I am. We are going to alexandria tomorrow for two days.
Should I do anything?
One of the speed module machine inserters had the wrong circuit stuck in it.
...?
Oh, I was taking out a tonne too.
No voice?
That is what I am doing.
Expanding the border north.
Oh god what is wrong with you.
It took me forever to join.
Oh god.
We can set up just a laser border and expand it north when we need to make the bus longer.
fuck, restart
We should really get a mod that lets us keep items.
The current system is stupid.
Mod called black box
Server is not running?
Six minutes.
The ion cannons are having happy happy fun time up north.
Still no voice?
I noticed but we backed up a lot so I used some.
I think I might.
I have no idea how my phone works.
Did you buy anything?
Still awake?
Want to start the server?
Still no voice?
Why?
Damn robot child is the reason for this trump lead.
Stein could still win.
Too early to call.
About Jill.
Any exciting food?
It is illegal to plot to kill the president, right?
Is it though?
The uk voted to leave and now I do not trust people.
Yeah but fucking moray.
70% is not good enough.
It was a close state in predictions.
Lets hope for a democratic congress.
Could not give a shit who the president is.
Powercut
It could not shut up one of the mosques though.
She currently has the popular vote.
Well shit.
That was a long night.
Fucking Florida.
I am leaving in 45 minutes.
Have to pack and wake up.
Yeah, that cunt.
They have a messed up voting system though. First past the post. Hillary currently has more votes.
Have to prepare to leave. Only have forty minutes to pack and wake up.
Patrick is my boy.
First past the post voting.
Was watching that all night.
toka
Mariam?
I hope Randall is salty as fuck.
Just found a post office about 50m from our flat.
So I might try sending a letter.
Damn, galaxy s support now. 
My phone reboots when I try to use 3d or watch a video anyway.
The wifi is a bit of an issue though.
Suppose I could turn it into a true phone.
I was so suprised. It is hidden behind a street.
Then again, the wifi and bluetooth are supported in the linux kernel.
I think I will not have internet.
I will be back Friday night.
Yep, I got everything working.
I am home.
The internet at home broke while I was away.
I am home now.
Yeah, you have it all back to normal now.
Sure.
More than that, the router was changed again.
No, Cairo.
Hold on, cooking dinner.
Well, the flat had an infestation and toka was working the first day but the last day was good.
We went cycling, and got to el mamoora beach at 8:30.
We ate lots of bread sticks.
What?
Was it a late message?
Oh right, yeah that is fine.
I know you are just trying to care for me. I am not going to make any rash decisions.
Yeah, I meant to say euro for that.
There were other mistakes too.
Which is why they are not issuing European visas, illegally.
Oh wow, why did you leave facebook?
I wonder if you will find it relaxing to be away from facebook.
Nope.
It all seems too stressful to me. All the social interactions flying everywhere.
I just clarified with her. I hung up the call with Ben when you started speaking to me that dad.
day.
I just did not know how to reply for a long time.
Where did you guys meet?
That time you did.
Nope, still stuck in limbo.
I fully expect them to delay it until the law changes.
Them delaying the processing of the application.
No reason, I complained to the European Commission because by EU law they have two weeks, four max to issue the visa.
And they replied that they have had many reports of Ireland breaking this law and that an investigation had been started earlier this year.
Since June.
Everything is fine here, seriously, I would not worry.
Obviously I would rather live in Scotland, but it is not the end of the world.
We went to Alexandria this weekend for Toka's work and stayed an extra day.
Toka was learning how to cycle around El mamoora.
Crashed into quite a few bins.
Well her bum was not after that cycle seat.
I could barely manage Forres and back from Lossie.
Did you start using your bike?
She said "euuawwww, say she said I MISS YOU TOO IAN!"
Oh, if I say your name the message is in red.
People get too worked up about facebook friends.
Toka says after a little while you probably will not be thinking of it.
Toka says, "Have you seen toka's last profile picture?"
She actually used third person there.
I am trying to find it, hold on.
We went to a British female, Egyptian male wedding a week or two ago.
The bride's dad wore a kilt because he was born in Scotland but he moved to England and the USA and no longer had an accent.
I guess he thought he could get away with it thinking there would be no Scottish people there.
But I knew.
They had around 50 English/American guests, pretty crazy.
I do not even know 50 people.
Come back.
Okay, well bel henna wil shefa. Love you.
(enjoy your meal)
Toka did not believe me when I told her about fish and chip shops.
Marimarimar
Some factorio?
For the rest of the night?
Nah, just message me if you feel like playing.
Really wish it would run on lost.host so we could play whenever.
Yeah.
No idea what happened, by the time I knew the router was replaced.
Are you ready for photos?
Oh wow, I sent the wrong photo.
How are you Mariam?
I am.
Are you because I was not here,
Can you be better?
For medicine?
A psychiatrist's job is to figure out which medicine you need.
And to take all your money.
You tried everything but meeting me.
Very very itchy from lots of bites on my feet.
I would be happier.
I would be able to say I have met three of my friends.
But when will it be a reality.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
I think from the tens of thousands of messages I have from you, I would know if I disliked you.
What is missing that could possibly outweigh what I already know?
I think you will find my facial expressions weird. 
And my gummy smile.
Or maybe you will only focus on me pulling hairs out my chin.
What will I find weird about you?
I expect you to be nervous.
And I have recordings of you.
Well I have seen those too and they are nice.
Maybe you fart all the time.
Maybe you fall asleep mid conversation.
Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.
Goodnight Mariak <3
Good morning.
Are you fine?
I am.
What will you do today?
I should go make tea before I die.
Maybe have a banana.
You are failing to eat a banana.
Someone told me to eat one before an exam once.
A silent, or calm?
Have you seen blue is the warmest colour?
How obscure do you want it?
I am going to go with:
Sad but beautiful and calm: the diving bell and the butterfly
Sad and calm and in my top 3 favourite films: nobody knows
Do not watch trailers though.
Nobody knows is a straight up lie.
Calm and in my top 5: still walking
silent: metropolis
My favourite animation: song of the sea
See the lost season 3 h&r on btn?
I got a quarter the way through downloading that torrent and some peer was uploading 90% corrupt chunks.
*cunt
It became impossible to finish so I downloaded a different torrent.
Maybe, but I thought the point of it was a blueprint you could slap down in a grid on ores.
I recommend Severed.
Yeah.
I am thinking we use drones for ore transport.
Since they never charge.
Want to play now?
Gave in what?
I was not on the internet for a few days.
Oh, I did? 
It is called amibo something.
It adds a campsite.
Here, go take a photo of you in good light with your hair not covering your face and with a light plain background.
Making a mii for you.
Oh, and mummy too.
Maybe, I will try.
Do you have a bigger version?
Do you have a straight on photo of you? Making a mii character in a game.
Favourite color?
What was I doing?
One with a closer face would be better.
Okay on a scale from 1 to 8
slow - quick
Energy
(bedbound)
Yeah.
Speech (caring to direct)
Facial expressions (flat to varied)
Mood (serious to light)
Overall (unique to normal)
You moved into room 103.
You are Easy-going, looks: gentle, character: relaxed, kind and honest. sensitive and innocent.
Carer: looks after everybody and works hard to make sure they all get along. Always trusting others can make them vulnerable.
Game is funnily accurate on how the miis behave.
Tamagochi island or something.
Pretty fun so far.
You just met toka.
They actually speak.
I think it might be cheap.
3ds
19dollars, 28gbp, what is wrong with the world.
Yeah. I play everything on the 3ds because I pirate the games.
Maybe you can find it for cheap in gamestop or on sale somewhere.
Or wait until I hack your 3ds.
Never watched it.
Yeah, this will do.
Actually, it is failing to detect a face.
Try straight on, not from above.
And without glasses or hair covering your face.
Yeah, this worked.
Birthday,b
?
When is your birthday?
Okay, last thing, you have to pick the thing toka sends.
The photo I sent.
Send me a number for each bar.
So energy:1 would be super lazy
etc
What would you say when you are feeling down?
Just building the character.
Are you awake?
Can you phone?
What the fuck.
Started playing tomodachi island.
Pretty fun.
Made your mii but you should choose the stats yourself.
Energy (slow - quick), speech (caring to direct), facial expressions (flat - varied), mood (serious - light), overall (unique - normal)
A scale from 1 to 8.
How quirky you want the character to act?
I put you as 6,8, 3, 3, 1
Was not too sure about the facial and mood.
No way are you anything but frank in speech though.
Your favourite colour and birthday?
I knew it was the 10th of something.
Some man is fixing a light switch.
The wiring is fucked.
There are two lights and two switches attached to two live cables and a short cable joining the two switches.
ln -sf /usr/lib64/libcurl-compat.so.4.4.0 /usr/lib64/libcurl.so.4

Mariam.
Where are you.
You have hidden for two days.
No.
Do you like mullberry juice?
In voice?
I forgot them all now.
Yeah, using gentoo.
It is because curl is using openssl.
Which is because hostapd does not compile with libressl.
I get the choice.
I chose libressl, but like I said.
Openssl has many other flaws.
But you have it installed.
The heartbleed fiasco for one.
Openssl does ship with sslv3...
It ships with sslv2.
Since openrct2 is the only thing using it.
I really do not care one this computer.
on
Purple stuff.
Come in.
Puriam.
Me too.
We had misasaisasia.
Misa2a2a7(
Miss ma3a2a7a5a.
I might have the rest of it now.
Is there food in bed?
Did you play it much?
Something about the servers being raided.
I slept for a long long time.
Is it the best?
I slept from 9:30pm to midnight, then 5am to 9am, the bin man woke me up, then 9am to 1:25pm, my alarm woke me up, then 2pm to 5:30pm.
Come in.
Wake up mariam.
Do you not stay up late anymore?
Are you asleep for ever.
Just a heads up, pokemon sun and moon are out on the 23rd of this month.
You got omega ruby?
It looks like you are about to walk into the mirror.
I am fine.
My head was very sore the last week and now it is fine.
But the skin on it is like cheese.
I can just scrape it off.
Prelim in British English.
Short for preliminary exams.
Nope, it seems like really bad sun burn... but I have not been in the sun.
Do you know if the European version of pokemon Sun/Moon will have a localized version of English?
Downloaded the Moon cia but the professor's English killed me.
Decided just to wait after ten minutes.
Prepared to hate the professor.
Prepare
Okay, Toka's parents' house time.
It is "American" in the sense that writing 'gonna' and 'yeah' everywhere is okay.
Yeah is fucking everywhere, yeah?
I am home.
Well, toka is going to buy a moto g4 very soon.
Going to order it in the uk for 150gbp and deliver it to a guy in london and toka's boss will pick it up next week.
They are not sold in Egypt, and even if it were, the import on foreign goods is too high here.
The character I made for you was fighting with lisa's one today.
Throwing everything in the flat at each other then you would not talk.
I guess it is a reference from something else, but I only know it from factorio.
Nada tried to get you two to apologize but you both just saying that neither of you started it.
Yeah, it is funny how accurate everyone acts in it.
No, that was the next Nintendo game console.
I do not want a phone.
Well, you argue a lot.
As far as phones go, it is super cheap for what it is.
She has been saving for it, just easier to buy in gbp.
Yeah.
She is too busy being in bed.
Must be so bad for her back. Not at the age where you get body pains yet though.
I did get B12, but they are sublingual.
Which means they have to disolve below my tongue and get absorbed through the bottom of my toungue straight into my blood stream.
Very weird and difficult not to swallow anything for five minutes.
Super cheap though.
Nah, these are fine, and much cheaper. 
They Egyptian currency was let to float last weak and the exchange rate jumped from 11.6 to 20.
So all of our money in EGP is now exchangable for half as much when converting to another currency.
It is worth the same for all domestic produce.
But all imported goods now cost twice as much.
And if you convert gbp to egp now, you can buy twice as much egyptian goods as last week.
(Good time to holiday if you want cheap food, hotels, and drink)
Finally.
Liberal government.
Best to keep it all in pounds. So my british account.
Good in an internationalist sense, bad for egyptians though, but bad that I converted a load of money before it happened.
Well, the majority of our funds were in EGP so now we have half as much in EUR.
Nah, they will not reverse floating a currency.
What will you do after?
Ben, wtf.
what.cd
Nice factorio reference?
Not sure how they managed to destroy all data in that case.
I would be much more devestated by ptp.
Time for a decentralised tracker system.
The speed thing is an issue only on rare files, which is quite important.
I guess with a currency system.
Someone must be able to implement all this blockchain shit into a tracker.
The upcoming video sharing thing I told you about, but with any file.
Yeah, but they give you bonus points. I think a ratio system where your upload points are not GB uploaded.
Because with btn, you can still never upload much data and get away with it.
Btn has no limit to downloading.
But seedboxes snatching new torrents is a flaw.
The points gained should be your bandwidth as a percent of total torrent bandwidth.
So all torrents give an equal number of points scaling with demand.
No point snatching a new torrent already with 1Gb/s upload and 1Mb/s download.
Would reward most points for snatching torrents that have been maxed out on torrent bandwidth.
Anyway, ripwhat.
I really have no idea what this is, it was in a thread on the what.cd matter.
Built in go though.
For fuck sake.
You are the rat.
Valid point, ptp and gg are our best profiles.
Really wondering how the data was destroyed if it was seized.
They hooked it up for a second to the internet and an ssh command ran rm -rf /
Gnu/RMS
Stallman made a blog post about why he will never use uber, which is valid, but he sources buzzfeed two or three times and I can not shake it.
Didn't archive.org download all the FLAC torrents though? It's not gone, we just need to convince archive.org to get leaky

Think I found a tippit on gg, "Artifaxx - Guys, with the recent closure of WCD, we will be preemptively shutting down. Everything will be backed up and servers will be wiped. This should hopefully be only temporary, but I need to discuss with all the staff on what our next steps are. xF is on vacation, so it'll be at least  untill he gets back."
Just fuck centralisation
So long and thanks for all the fish is a Douglas Adams reference.
Lease your storage space for currency, then use currency to buy money, or storage space in the network?
Found that site at the bottom of the ipfs site.
I assume all the data is encrypted and random blocks.
I assume.
I skimmed the pdf but not sure.
As discussed so far, Filecoin nodes have an incentive to hoard pieces, to retain the rarest for themselves and
Seems legit.
Wait
I do have 3TiB sitting around.
Think they are working on it, but been silent for a year. I suppose busy with ipfs.
ipfs has a package on arch go-ips, and also a wiki article.
MIT lisence.
Wow, mounting the world.
Giving it a build to try out.
Interesting that it hashes the files and does not duplicate the same files.
Kind of like a giant tracker where I want to send you a file but if that file exists already, fuck the upload part.
Mmm, better get that vpn.
Mareirimeonrrrmaartihem
How do you find a vpn to trust? Which government has the best privacy laws?
Iceland maybe?
Well, 3262 servers in 24 countries, I get that they log nothing, but the isps of those countries can log the odata to the servers.
The uk isps are still required to log all outgoing traffic, right.
Makes more sense to just make sure all data is encrypted.
Not sure how much of the initial connection is encrypted. I worry that the destination address can not be encrypted.
So that sure they can not see the data but when my outgoing log is just full of childporn.me requests.
When you put out an initial request to a server.
The whole problem tor solves, right?
Snoopers can not see the data, but they can see where it is going.
Ah, yes, I think I just forgot something. Vpn solves that.
As in they lie about not storing logs.
But then, would the UK based VPNs not be forced to start logging?
Or worse, a UK based VPN provider, forced to log all servers.
Ah true, does not matter if an isp logs all the outgoing and incomming of a vpn.
Pings.
I changed the battery in our clock the other day and on the back was a little plain rectangle sticker with the number 1337 on, only.
Just an standard as fuck clock centre.
I will photo it at some point.
ipfs seems pretty legit. All in blocks.
Nice webui included.
Shows me the 56 peers I am connected to.
Just a giant distributed filesystem you can cat or mount or whatever.
Porn collections are going to be godly.
A bit long, but covers it all.
It only stores and seeds what you download. It is not stored encrypted, but all traffic is.
Wow, I just hosted riot on ipfs and it runs perfectly.
At least my isp just sees me downloading randomly name encrypted blocks from peers all over the place.
Not sure if your 3ds will tell you, but go download the free swapdoodle from the eshop.
The idle bandwidth usage of it is too high right now.
420 down 250 up in five hours.
Known issue.
Yeah.
statistics and idle stuff.
Actually, the upload will be because I host the getting started docs.
And then I guess a lot of people connect for that.
If I had unlimited bandwidth, 2-15KiB/s all the time would be nothing.
But that low speed does accumulate.
I saw that you can "pin" certain dirs/files to always host them, and the rest is just cache.
Is it not the NSA's job to get data like that?
Which is get the data without any warrants or anyone knowing.
No logs seems legit.
I have been on the page, but I will give it a closer look after I get up later.
Got some pokemon sun to sesh.
It is one of the multi region games so all languages are on the only release.
No hope of the european version being different.
Back to bed.
The problem with mine just stopped happening, cleaning did not help.
I just woke up.
Tell your router to use opendns.
It should always be possible.
Any news about that switch news?
Then set all the computers to not use the router's dns server.
Or, set up dnsmasq on your computer and set all computers to use your computer as the dns server.
You can set computers to go to an ip address when they need an ip for a name, then the router is not involved.
That page is 100% lies.
They just lie and tell people opendns means you are responsible for ddos attacks.
There must be discussion about this page.
How are virginmedia allowed to publish that?
The whole thing is either written by someone who has no fucking idea, or a liar.
I think the only thing they spy on there is your router settings.
To log your outgoing ip addresses and give a shit, seems too far.
You should set up a dnsmasq server on your pi, and use your pi for name resolution.
And tell the pi to use opendns to get any addresses that expired or unknown.
Dns servers are just giant caches.
Although, incase your pi is off, when setting the dns addresses for your other computers, add opendns as a second alternative on them too.
I hope the news is not the sun/moon switch rumour.
Shit, it is.
Your computer asks your router for a name, your router does not have it, it asks whatever it is configed to ask.
So on, if the isp dns server does not have it, it asks another one.
That simple.
My file has been the opendns ones for a long time.
Used to used google's but then opendns stopped using ads.
Have you ever came accross an ipv6 address yet?
Nope.
Your computer does not cache dns addresses, so no flush needed.
Your router caches addresses, so if you changed the dns server on that it would need flushed.
Not too sure, but you can use your vpn's addresses if you prefer.
Opendns is owned by cisco.
Yeah.
Me to the server is 100ish.
OpenDNS get 80 billion requests a day, not sure logging that is practical.
...
lost.host to my address is 114ms.
Wow, opendns is closed source.
Time to change.
This is the source on wikipedia, shitty as usual.
"The OpenNIC project is a non profit, democratic body where each user gets a vote when deciding new TLDs, policy changes, and the direction of the project."
Is tier 1 or 2 better?
I am not sure, how can I trust there is no logging if the source is closed.
I can set lost.host to run a dns server and we could use that.
I think so, there is dnscrypt but it is an authentication system to ensure no middle point alters the request.
Seems like a bigger advantage than running my own.
True, make sure to pick the log anon and dnscrypt ones without the dollar bag though.
Can not trust the word sponser.
Seems like bribe to me.
The full server list.
Yeah, but it requires running a proxy and I fear it is coded in nodejs or something.
Not going to bother with the closest, just getting the ones with log anon and dnscrypt
nameserver 130.255.73.90nameserver 50.116.40.226nameserver 104.238.186.189nameserver 185.121.177.177nameserver 185.121.177.53
The only thing is ping times go up a lot.
Not sure if it is worth it.
Ah valid point in that thread, unencrypted so your isp can log which name you are requesting from that ip.
Via vpn, I have no idea. I think name res happens before any get requests.
One person said vpn will encrypt dns queries.
Think you have to set it up to use your vpn's though.
Some are whitelisted.
I really hope virgin does not use transparent dns proxies.
Why?
Odd.
Yeah but as long as you use a stable version that gets security patches.
An audit reveals flaws, which an update is meant to fix.
When it comes to openssl and such, the latest is always considered the most secure.
Yeah, vpn seems the way to go.
Severed is a pretty great game.
Opennic was too slow for me.
I wonder if google is faster than opendns.
1-2ms faster.
Going to get food.
Running namebench now.
Wow, using 4515 nameservers.
Against the top 2000 sites.
Jesus, it is still running.
It pinged 4515 servers and only 13.2% responded.
Pretty sure they log data and provide it upon government requests.
But having an account you can purge the log.
The dnscrypt is meant to have a list of servers that do not log somewhere.
dnscrypt site
dnscrypt is in c.
Damn, has a package on openbsd.
Saw this earlier.
Regrexit xom
30s of entertainment.
The conservatives can have a 334 seat majority and still only have five constituancies in scotland.
You can stick conversative up to 86% and glasgow is still snp.
The last two snp regions fall at a 91% conservative vote and 610 seat majority.
7% con, 85% labour, and banff is still snp.
Closed the page now, but is con+lab more than snp?
The advanced graphical swingometer lets you do by country.
Are you free.
Will we meet?
Everyone recommends bots.
Within an hours walking distance.
Hello.
I just ordered toka's new phone.
g4 obviously
moto g4 obviously.
I would go with a dumb phone.
She uses it for everything.
You have no idea how many messages I just sent to the wrong people.
Now I am talking about phones to ben when I never wanted to.
Anyway, I just ordered toka's new phone.
I hope it gets to egypt fine.
A moto g4.
No, I only use my phone to call and text toka.
Nothing else.
I would like a new computer, or three.
Do you know a place?
Not in Cairo.
I know this island a long way away that has a lot of nature to explore.
No, Britain.
Why not cuba?
Nope.
Did you just watch it?
Did you watch any the calm ones I said?
Will you stay up late again?
:D
Maybe my nights will be less boring.
An invidulator?
As in a real identical twin, or just figurative?
Do you have a secret identical twin?
Too many people.
What if hazem had an identical twin?
I started making hot juice again because it gets so cold around 5am.
Why would it be bad?
I did a thing where I can use my monitor and main pc full screen, and type on it to a smaller computer and screen.
I will show you.
Not the british way, but with fake juice here.
This way I can never miss a message from you.
Catchy song though.
You can filter out memes.
Did you die?
I showed you the screen thing.
I will show you the juice when I make it.
I am cooking ta5me53Ya2a now.
I have hot things to eat and drink first.
Mullberry.
Are you cold?
Do you actually like it?
It tastes very weak.
It disolves better in hotter water.
Is is mainly just sugar though.
Good morning.
We are going to make you a character in this game.
But we need a close photo of your face for the facial detection.
With a plain background and looking straight at the camera.
I found one.
I just have to get you to tell me some stats.
Your hair color, style, birthday, favourite color, and a few other things.
gg still down.
what.cd completely down.
ptp has the what issue on the front page, not a metion from btn.
ptp migrating to a new host.
Every whatimg link broken.
Where are you?
No but I am sure they would make me feel good.
Thoughts on the scotland news?
Is it the medicine or the music I send.
I asked Nada why she was talking to you on the 19th of Feburary.
I said you are my friend now so back off.
The PM telling the FM to wait.
This is the photo I used.
I had to guess your hair.
Usually, the characters act scarily close to the real life versions.
I feel like there is a hole in me because I do not know what your hair looks like.
I gave you corn flakes and you liked them a little bit, but you did not like chamomile tea.
We had rum tonight.
Like pirates.
Not a lot though.
It is just chamomile, they call it tea but it usually has no tea.
No no we had that in real life.
Is your hair that kind of curly though?
Into the blood.
We take lots of screen shots of the things they do.
Not updated quite yet.
Have not seen any screenshots of it.
I will but after a few are taken.
Connecting it to the pc is a little awkward.
You are sleeping right now.
You said, "what on earth" in your sleep.
xbox 360 people?
I jest that it is to them as indev is to us.
I have fool.
Do you have classes still?
No.
You said you were free.
I woke up to eat everything.
Hi. The alarm woke me up.
I need tea so much.
What will you draw?
What are you doing today?
It used to be my best method.
It looks like a plant bud.
Lots of things. I did art in school and pastels was the thing I was best at.
This was 11 and 10 years ago.
I am really hungry but there is nothing to eat without cooking and I should wait for toka to be home to cook.
We are having something like ol2a.
Yeah, that.
Why did you not make pizza?
Why can you not?
It is super easy as long as you stick to the recipe.
Have you tried my snowman onesie on for the authentic snowman experience?
Should be with my clothes, wherever that is.
Easiest to ask mummy where my onesies are.
Just a visit?
Hello.
Are you wonderful?
I am pretty okay.
I want some juice.
You can make cookies.
I do too.
I do because I do not drink enough tea and water.
Did you sleep.
Marriammmmmmmmmmm.
I am going to install a different operating system on my main computer today.
It is one I used to use, and I installed it on my little computer last night and was impressed enough.
What was it called again?
We started watching 'The Artist' yesterday, but like usual, toka fell asleep.
A movie.
Maybe tonight.
What is big ones?
Ah, yes. -12C where?
Vector web updated to 0.9
Aparrently riot now has end to end.
You are the admin, so enable it for the room after a refresh?
Android and ios clients have it now.
I have no idea how my mm client will handle it.
Or how it works at all.
For others.
Did you refresh?
Your favourite food in tomodachi life is lemonade.
This is actually a direct chat, something that was not implemented when we started I think.
Are you fine?
Encrypted from client to server though.
And I do not worry about the security of the server.
Yeah, I do not accept http connections.
Lisa, you are watching the walking dead?
I am on the latest episode, been watching it for years.
It gets pretty bad at season 3-4, but then picks up again.
They kept cutting the budget for it.
Fired the guy responsible for making season one great, I think some of the actors left because of that.
Nah, it is just the way I reply.
I have to type meredith before each message to send it.
I downloaded sun on the NA release, but have only played three or four hours.
No idea why it is taking me so long to sesh it.
I am glad pokebank is not supported until January.
I watched stranger things.
Not too bad.
That is not the worst thing about it, bad child acting is.
Season two was confirmed.
MARIAM WHERE ARE YOU
It feels like forever.
What were you getting?
Trousers or pants?
Yes.
Are you going to show me your favorite gray pants?
It was a joke. You showed me your favorite gray tee.
It rained yesterday.
Yes it was wet outside and I saw the forcast a few days ago.
When I slept.
Also a very large tree fell down outside our flat.
I was asleep.
I doubt it was wind, it looks like some twat tried to cut it down and it hit everything.
And then left it. No way wind could blow it down.
I need tea.
SCOTTISH
I have a cucumber.
I have a tea.
What do you have?
But what do you have?
I still have tea.
I have it still but it is inside me.
I know what you mean.
I will sleep.
Wake up soon.
Good morning <3
Where are you?
Did you not get swapdoodle?
I still have tea.
Are you going to teach me arabic today?
Going to have a go at making a posix shell script for getting youtube streams.
Fed up of youtube_dl with its 1001 features and python.
Where were you?
Anything you feel like.
If that was teaching I could just read a dictionary.
Bits at a time.
Grammar and verbs.
I had to learn all the names of English cases to teach them.
The usual ones passive, continious, simple, perfect.
English only has four true gramatical cases.
I remember learning from Erik that Estonian has 16.
Honestly, the only English one I can name is possesive.
Whisper "aha" to a person the other side of the room.
I can look.
What kind do you want?
But you only know how to make cookies.
Who was that by?
Come back.
Jeez, hard to match that peice.
That is the this is maha song.
There is a lot of stuff on this channel.
Do you like them?
I think I have a new favourite youtube music channel.
Listen to that.
Hello.
Where are you?
:(
I woke up.
I regret taking my ear plugs out.
I put my earplugs back in an eugh the world is better.
Why did you wake up so early?
Pffffffffffffffft.
I have tea and an unwillingness to start today.
I think not.
Wow, did you know windows 10 aniversiary edition auto installs third party "featured" software because in-app purchases?
Candy crush, farmville, netflix.
That kind of cancer.
ben
No but the more people that have the software installed, the more likely they will open it.
ben
No prompt.
That ben was an accident.
All the bens are accidents. I forget that I do not have to type ben anymore.
Now the message screen restarts until I send an empty message or press escape.
You can not even disable the downloads, you have to go into regedit.
xom
I have decided that btn is just fucked.
I have been seeding those exact torrents for ever.
I have a 0.05 ratio on the westworld one.
Quite a bit. Lost, the walking dead, stranger things, westworld.
There should be logs in the snatches.
Maybe rick and morty too.
I wish the snatch number would include the number of episodes in a pack.
Getting 1500 snatches is insane.
So is westworld E01.
It is just fucked.
Oh wow, all of those torrents are there multiple times on the first 6 pages.
ben
Usually they go away but this lost one has been there way too long.
Oh wait, that is the fucked torrent.
The one with the corrupt seeder.
I thought it was 80%, but from experience, it seems to be 0%.
Yeah.
You did not just download 8GiB?
Oh Archer too.
And Game of Thrones.
ben
Yeah.
I am using transmission.
And Burnistoun.
And Peep Show and Bruiser.
6.76MiB out of 76.7MiB of this Planet Earth torrent is corrupt so far.
I feel like torrents should have the ability to ween out peers who send shitty data.
Since not all torrents do that, probably.
ben
Shitty peers or men in the middle, but it is encrypted, and I do not think the NSA operate in Egypt.
I no longer know. I stopped that torrent. Going to try to start the X-files tonight.
Nothing to do with dropping data though. That data gets resent, it is about data being changed or sent wrong.
This is not udp, tcp does not stop until you have the exact packets sent.
I have no idea what protocol torrents use.
I have to scram now.
I have no idea who that is.
I got a new cheap t-shirt last month and toka still will not let me wear it in the house becasue it will get old.
Tell her she is crazy.
Did you take a photo?
I did warn you.
ben
Honestly, there are too many cut scenes.
Outside.
I could never take a photo of a stranger.
She said I would have to take it off again.
Is `man` not enough?
Never heard of or used lex or yacc. Yacc sounds like yet another c compiler.
Pay what you want, but if you pay less than 1$ you get nothing.
Toka had never had chips with salt and vinegar before today.
Mariam, mariam, come in whenever mariam does.
I am. I just made chips with salt and vinegar.
But we ate them all.
What text editor do you use?
I learn a new vi command about once every month.
ben
Jesus, I am never going to adjust to that change.
Which starter did you pick?
I would have picked the fire cat but I hate cats too much now.
The water clown seal?
I went with the grass shooting owl.
Cats are not even nature.
Yeah she has owl bags and pillows, right.
I suppose.
Yeah.
Can not counter that.
I thought you were a hardcore normal guy.
I usually just mix it up.
I quite liked fighting/psychic.
I did. 
I thought you could tell that I remember no names after 151.
That is the one.
Was my catching bitch.
I had to go one of the genders to get sleep, paralyse, and false swipe.
Frogot (should be a forgetful frog) which.
Yes?
There is only one type of chip.
xom
Just started using clipmenu. Pretty usefull shit.
No idea why it took me this long to use a clip manager.
I use dmenu for everything.
There is not much to it.
Passmenu I have bound to alt-p, which lists my pass passwords.
Clipmenu bound to alt-c, lists everything you copy.
And well, scripting with dmenu is different.
Map alt-p to a pornmenu that gives you porn categories, select one and it streams a random video in that category.
Special UK version without fisting,bdsm,facesitting,fantasy,foreign,interaccial. Just missionary british porn, but not british people because that would be bad.
xom
You better start making britishporn.co.uk.
Sex education videos only.
My fetish is anything I have not seen.
Toka is making some very odd nose noises.
Sounds like a cartoon where someone would get an erection.
Never seen someone try to stick their dick in a nostril. Seen the belly button.
What about drown?
Or use it as a fisting lubricant.
Or cause the eyes to swell with it.
200, yeah, seems cheap.
Eshop sale.
US prices are so cheap.
Seems like it. A UK one must come though.
No, she never had vinegar on chips before.
She loved my chips.
Battle royal is hungry hippos.
Wait, are sun and moon not new3ds only?
The frame rate struggles during double battles.
One thing I can not fucking stand is pokemon calling for help. Makes some pokemon a bitch or impossible to catch without sleeping them.
I have just been lessing, which is nice because I can search, but less is more code than st. Less is huge. That patch is only a couple of lines and works flawlessly.
Are you here.
This is stupidly cheap.
My mum and sister said it was -12C where they are.
Wake up.
Jesus christ.
I spent ages looking for it, and decided I must have been remembering wrong and that the php thing I found was it.
But really this page is impossible to find.
Written in C, so write a subject line with length 66000 and crash the server.
Managing memory is one of those things.
Yeah, they should do that.
But anything longer than 20 lines and a mistake is in there.
I am a Go fan boy now and never look back to manual memory management.
I was never want to use malloc.
I mean, C is still my second choice. And I have no third.
You get used to it, but the possiblity of making mistakes exists.
Go is too strict.
Does not even compile if you have an unused variable.
Valid point that has annoyed me.
This is why I said too, and gave that example.
Back to prayer, though.
Shitty name.
Is it because tcp is so old?
Pretty hard to implement a new protocol now.
They just need to make it backwards compatible.
Yeah.
Tcp 2.0?
Where are you.
I have resulted to listening to music very loudly with ear plugs in under my headphones.
It blocks most the high end sounds, but it also blocks out screaming children.
Even better if you change the 10 to a 9
Are you home?
Did you just wake up?
I set an alarm on the home phone for 1:30 a week or so ago and I have only slept through it once.
mar
It is suprisingly good at waking me up.
You can dissapear as long as you still have access to this chat.
The X-Files 720p is smaller than the sd, by half, it is 8.62GiB.
Not the point though, 6.72GiB downloaded, 33.5MiB corrupt.
Even if it was tcp, a client could still pick peers by their likelyhood of corrupt data.
4,114 pieces @ 2.00MiB
Quite a few.
Unless the corruption is completely even across peers.
When I check the error stats of my hdd and sdd it is scary.
The sdd has had zero faults and the hdd, well, another story.
Forgot the tool that shows you those stats so I can not check now.
Some gui first party windows program I think.
Yeah. I think 1% would be pushing it.
You snatched it for the purpose of seeding?
Are you seedboxing?
Seedboxing should be a sport.
Always fun to snatch a linux distro on release and see how high you can get the ratio.
irc bot on the announce channel?
You have to be elite on most trackers to get into the announce channel.
That takes years of experience. 
You have to get popular torrents that are unlikely to be auto snatched by seedboxes.
No need to correct obvious grammar.
Gg is still down.
I was staring at it wondering if you would bother to correct it.
xom
I think it would be more cringe worthy if she did not laugh it off.
The UK is going to get fucked by the EU.
The UK wormed its way in.
Joining the EU with 101 special cases.
I think the EU will make an example of leavers.
Look at this ex-world power thinking it is still a world power.
And keeping nuclear weapons like using them is really a choice.
In a world where companies are bigger than some countries.
Interested now, walwart is the largest company with $482 billion USD revenue.
gdp nominal would be the fairest comparison right?
It would be the 24th.
There is a lot of good stuff on it.
Have you tried half opening it?
I sent many links.
There are a lot of categories.
Pornmenu is complete and a masterpeice.
Would you play the bagpipes?
Nope, but I had a flatmate who played it.
We are watching the X-files.
Right now? 
To see what?
Making pornmenu a reality.
Cuntbusting videos, that will be the new currency in a few weeks.
Quite a bit longer but deals with tags that have sub categories.
Not Dr. Stranglove?
Why would you spend money to see a film with added noise and people. 
The laptop or the cuntbusting?
A family outing.
Are you sleepy?
What will you do?
I am waiting for fool to defrost, watching videos, and playing pokemon.
You said fuck.
A very ewwchiceww omg why did a chicken die wich.
A7A NEIK MARIAM
Toka's parents' walls.
I heat up a full pot of water on the stove and put it under the desk to slowly release heat.
I woke up.
I slept for 12 hours.
And we still have not met.
Have you seen rick and morty yet?
The best animated television series.
I am pretty sure your English is good enough to get almost all the comedy.
Do you use it outside our conversations?
I wonder how much you have improved just because we talk.
Always to a brit. And maybe commonwealth nations.
Travel alone to somewhere I can walk to.
But then you would not be alone.
Your parents will.
This is the most regular, one message each conversation we have ever had.
Probably, look how long it goes on for.
Well now that I brought it up, we are very aware of not breaking the streak, or someone is a masochist.
Maybe update. Careful not to convert our chat to an end to end encrypted one though. I do not want to rewrite my chat application to support it. I trust my server to be private and secure, so end to end is not needed. And it would make the chat application over twice the size.
I mean updating is always good, but just do not go into the room settings and upgrade the encryption.
You did. Fixing it last time was just turning the notifications off and on again.
Yes, I know them.
They are indie folk, but not that great.
We can?
I have heard so many compilations, kind of hard to tell which hour mix is good.
I listen to music almost all the time, and generally new things.
I have been doing so since I was 11 or something.
Icky.
Not a fan of many british vocalists.
Just the voice and style.
Okay, I am going to walk into the kitchen and if that fool has not defrosted, oxem billeh.
I always forget how good ovened bread smells.
No where near so I cooked it.
The bread is so good. I took the one the guy was taking just out the oven.
The bread is so good. I took the one the person took out of the oven.
Wrong person.
Did you have caffiene?
Is it the ambient channel?
Was it the film?
mar
If I ever say mar, it is an accident.
Kind of a muscle memory thing from how I used to send messages.
Is it a mood swing because it is period time?
Are you sure? You were at the same time as toka.
Wow, what the hell.
Okay why do you feel good.
I might soon, but after a lot of water.
You should probably take medication if the anxiety has no purpose.
Are you anxious about meeting me?
mar
Drinking water makes me cold.
Wow. We need more hangouts.
I am freezing.
mar
I need to put a t-shirt on.
Have you tried getting a different phone.
Have you tried never closing the conversation.
Okay I think it is bed time.
gg up
Jesus, flamed is now a site admin.
What is the gilmore girls?
Mariam.
I am helping toka dye her hair but we ran out of dye and ordered more but had not enough cash so cancel and now a friend is getting more.
They are trying to nerf turret creeping.
Okay it came and we finished.
mar
How did notifications start working?
I will too.
Wake up.
Hello.
It went well, I guess you will see some photo she posts eventually.
Maybe but later tonight.
We went to get some food.
What colour do you think she went?
Ruby red.
You are smiling.
<3
I have tea and breadsticks.
Do you not have vector on your phone? How have you been offline for 17 days?
Wake up.
Fancy playing some Minecraft these day?
Same world as before.
Days
lost.host, right?
Yeah, it will take quite a while to get used to it again, but first time we do not start from scratch.
No, it was the skyland world.
We had insane sky scraper farms.
Yep.
God, the minecraft folder has, bendypauldron videos, minecraft, piratecraft, sky, skyfactory2, terrafirmacraft.
Pretty sure it is just sky, june 12.
How on earth is she allowed to drive a car?
Balls, pretty sure the ports are not open for minecraft.
Going to have to get my mum to do that, or send me the router password and I try to forward an x session.
Like I imagine things connected to her shoulders.
I see videos here of people driving with their feet.
Their governments need to draw hard lines.
They have to take a foot off the wheel to break. And accelerate.
You are supposed to always have two hands on a wheel.
Just use public transport, jesus.
Dirty buttons is not a risk to my life.
Have you tried going home?
Wow.
Here, are you watching Westworld?
It is.
Are you home yet.
Yeah, but it is inactive.
Open it.
I have two but they have 0 in them.
I have no card and the login details are probably lost.
I left them because I did not like their terms and conditions.
I mean, I really want it shut because who knows what they are going to do with my data now.
It gives me to the 2nd of september 2016 to reject the terms or I automatically accept them.
Yeah, just send me a message when you need the details.
I ordered the phone last week to a guy in London through amazon and toka's boss picked it up.
So we skipped all the import taxes.
She is off the chart excited.
Yeah we could have done it, but I am a little more patient.
Toka has been struggling with a dying phone forever. My keyboard works just fine.
It is getting really cold. At night it can go to 13C, which does not seem cold, but there are no heaters.
Yeah, I have my onesie and blankets.
Since the process one application a week, I can say with some confidence that they are just lying cunts.
If you look at the pdfs, there is usually only one, at the top, with the lowest number, for non-eea family members.
Are you telling me out of the entire of the middle east there is only one application a week?
They are just not processing them.
Which is illegal and racist.
Officially they state all visas are done in order recieved and they are dealing with a backlog.
But everyone knows that is complete horseshit.
Besides, our savings halved in value thanks to the Egyptian government.
Would have been possible if they issued within two weeks like they are required to.
Now it is too late.
Because the currency change.
By the time we would have back to the amount we had before, it would be well over a year, and the UK will no longer be in the EU and we no longer have the right to go anywhere in Europe.
I just hope the Scottish people stay in the EU.
That would give us time.
English and the Welsh, bar the Londoners. 
Maaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Last one exploded on me.
Usually in bed it fine.
How are you finding sun/moon?
ben
Very story based, but good bits at a time.
Hoping it does have good open world mechanics after the main story.
The removal of HMs is good.
Not a fan of the festival plaza, but the other place is good.
How many hours have you played...?
You should have Tauros Charge, right?
Okay, I expected you to have played a lot more.
Wow.
.6>zoX.+2t.`fC&(DGP%m"Lu-
Do you not exist today?
I that a record?
I woke up now.
Nigger, ptp never forced https.
Both gg, and btn do.
I just assumed a torrent site would not serve http.
Probably.
25% of the UK must pirate consistently. And 95% must break copyright all the time.
What the fuck is the UK going to do about?
I really hope Iceland's pirate party wins. 
This dark green is the left-green party.
Pretty funny how accurate that is.
This is the size of the image loading on the top 10 page.
Who knows how big other images are.
What is up with the torrent sites sucking ass at making thumbnails. It is not difficult.
You would need 8k for that to be correct.
I have been farming this one patch of grass for two hours now trying to get a certain nature and ability, and for the first time a rattata appeared.
Bit weird that a rattata has something like a 1% chance.
It always breaks.
I mean, intel processors are this really, beat me to that, but not the same architecture.
There are lots of them now so my theory is that they only come out at night.
Hi.
Changed my mind about the plaza. I like it now.
Are you asleep again.
Did you start westworld yet?
Why am I woken up every day by shitty parents and screaming children?
Everyone is a neighbour when everyone lives so close.
Enough of those thoughts.
It always is.
I do not have any recent photos of me. They are on toka's phone.
But here is a dark one.
But who would have expected ff15 to get a higher score than sun/moon?
Does ff not get low scores these days?
You are sleeping too much.
Because you are always asleep.
Do you not get a break after exams?
Just quit.
hi
TOKA, HOW ARE YOU?
Are you alive?
How are you?
I hate wifi.
Did you get stuck in a repeating loop?
Just some park nearish us.
Toka should get her new phone tomorrow.
I am thinking about putting on one of her dresses tomorrow for when she gets back to shock her.
I would have to shave my legs.
I use my raspberry pi with it's screen as a status bar and matrix client.
Just the output part, I use my main computer with a keyboard for the input part, obviously.
Been trying to minimize it, out of interest.
For context, there is a boot partition that has kernel stuff for the pi, and the initramfs loads packages and config diffs into ram.
So the whole system sits in ram, and then configuration changes save into a overlay on the boot partition.
The boot partition is currently using 35.8MiB.
10MiB of that is ncurses. A few more is wireless tools.
The rest is mostly the kernel initramfs.
Nothing like 101 dogs howling at fajr.
I do not get why operations like that can not be made out of other gpu instructions.
It is trivial to implement 128 bit integer operations with x86 64bit.
I mean, it is possible, hence the library, but how is it that much effort?
I would expect the people at intel to do it in a few hundred lines in a day.
Who knows, gpus are so abstracted it is hard to take them seriously.
I can know how cpus work and I can send them instructions.
Why on earth do we need graphic drivers. Why is a standard instruction set and a compiller not okay for GPUs?
Or at least combine the two processors and send appropriate instructions to the gpu part.
Say I send 48 add instructions in a row, the cpu can run four at a time, but if the gpu could do these instructions too, why not let the processor send instructions to the gpu cores?
Why can we not have processors with a small number of complex cores, and a large number of simple cores?
Very much a system on chip.
Your last long sentence pretty much sums it up.
It would not be the compilers job.
The cpu will process instructions in parrallel that it can, without instructions to do so.
This is the parralellism I mean.
Like there are 4 ADD sections in a core, and as long as you use different registers and they do not depend on results, the cpu will run them at the same time.
It would be the compilers job not to use the same registers for sequential add instructions.
Well yeah, this is per core level.
To use both cores, that is the compiller's job.
Why not just have 16 add sections, one core, and 4x as many registers?
Much harder to connect up and design I strongly assume.

Hi.
The building in Dubai?
You will need to build it outside.
Happy December.
When are we having our December hangout?
I am hungry for fool.
That word that totalbiscuit uses differently: issue.
He says isju instead of ishu.
I looked it up and it is a real think, but he is the only person I have noticed it in. And he says issue a lot.
A week until I am 25, or something.
hi
I woke up.
My face hurts so much.
I need too.
Tea.
I regret not having permenant ear plugs.
Are you fine?
Fucking right.
Did I miss a service?
Happened last night and figured out what was going on around midnight.
gg down again.
Are you home?
Do they have no penises?
I let that autoplay and I have no idea what is going on.
The hot water for bath challenge.
Oh god, these thumbnails are disgusting.
COME SAY HI NOW.
hello
I think your home is only an hour away from me.
The forecast was rain for yesterday and today.
Nothing like a bit of rain to highlight how dirty cairo is.
I mean walking.
Do you have any idea how cold I am?
Down to 8C this weekend's nights.
I have never worn a jumper under my onesie.
I would just put the heating on.
It gets down to 9C at nights now. With single glazing windows, gaps everywhere, and no heaters, I think this flat could challenge yours.
But heaters.
It never really got below 14C in my loft in Scotland.
Unless the house was empty for a few days.
I could just turn on the gas hob.
But the building not insulated.
Holes around doors, and shitty windows.
Fix that shit, what the hell.
More rars?
Get the bristles on the go.
Can not cost much from a hardware store.
Like the one at my mum's house?
A long teddy dog as a draft excluder.
rars and isos should be illegal.
And zips.
If it is scene they will not do shit.
I would hope an iso is a disc rip.
So an install file with some data.
A .sh?
zips
tar.gz?
Holy fucking shit.
Can they not fucking learn how to make split xz archives?
tar for container, xz for compression, iso for another container, rar for compression and another container and split.
We should make a game tracker.
I think they are just fucking idiots.
Yeah, I brought it up in the forums.
"It is just the way scene works. It is shit but deal with it."
No standards at all.
I get 30% off a load of nintendo games because it is my birthday month...
I downloaded this cd from some forum and it was in split archive rar files, with a raw iso rip of the audio cd, can I upload this?
permaban from what
I did a few transcodes on ptp, pretty hard to get correct. They have some weird fucking rule about ratio.
Not going to expand upon that because I forgot everything and I have to go cook.
Pretty sure that happens when the person does tar -f out.tar ./* instead of tar -f out.tar ../dir
Or ./
Or just . 
I hate how every program interpretes a trailing slash differently.
I would get a seed box to do that.
Download torrents, tar.xz them, then upload to the new tracker.
Movies are compressed and archived.
Highly compressed, and archived in mkv files.
Audio is already highly compressed.
Compressing a game with xz likely saves quite a bit of data.
Compressed tar though.
Tv is not archived because it should be a simple list of the episodes all compressed.
Games are more diverse in their file structures.
And the files are usually not compressed at all.
I can imagine maybe some large data files are, sometimes.
The only one that seems to make sense is a trailing slash means nothing. But some say it means all the content of that dir.
Like rsync.
Will you have time to talk?
It was not worth it after double archiving.
No.
Are you traveling there now?
Will we hangout?
RIGHT NOW
Right, a 5L or so pan, boil the water, lid on, take into this room.
The lid should stop too much water getting in the air.
Sticking it under my desk.
Wow, the english translation of ffXV has grammar issues.
I do not get how that can happen.
Do they not play test it?
At least not the tutorial.
The tutorial room looks like a shitty unreal engine demo room for fabrics or lighting from 2008.
It has no style.
Like a copy paste 3d model room.
The style of sun and moon is also laking in the environment. Indoors, battle scenes, and character/pokemon models are fine.
But outdoor is just bland.
Had no lag in totem battles.
Only in (spoiler), and in 2v2.
Then again, it might be that I force the higher clock speeds.
No idea if it uses that normally.
It is because I write colour quite a lot in programming and I use american english writing code because most people reading it will be using american english.
Starts at 0:40
I spelt colour wron.g
Eh, sounds like an unlikely coincidence.
Unless they pick in order.
They just have the electorial list and go in order.
Can not imagine someone sitting with a dos program that randomly selects a person.
I imagine they just fucking point at a physical list.
Or double click a database until they get to a person.
I am home.
There is a profile system on android so I can log in as my user and have no access to toka's stuff.
And it uses my fingerprint to gain access.
It works very quickly and well.
So I have access to any photos I take, but not the ones toka takes.
It is crazy good.
Not going to go on about it, but I will probably take more photos now.
Not yet.
What do you have to do there?
Do you not have a coloring book?
I have fool and tea.
Hello MARIAM.
Can you?
Just take a bus.
Mmmmmmmmmmmm tea.
Yeah, I know. But I am tickling your fantasy generator.
I have more tea.
Never.
Yeah, I prefer coffee, but tea is cheaper and closer and easier.
It is mint and green tea mixed together.
What do I want to eat?
Are you coming home now?
Okay, it is clean everything with bleach time.
I finished cleaning.
Did you eat?
I have still not seen you and hazem.
Four days until I am twenty five.
I am so hungry.
But I aint prime.
I have a pot of 8L or so of boiling water under the desk.
It has a lid on it.
And was boiling before it started losing heat.
Why are you wearing a bra in bed?
Well, I did not have to explicitly tell you to take it off.
There is something very loud outside.
Is al ahly club playing football in the dark?
There is very very loud music coming from far away.
And a guy on a mega phone and lots of shouting.
I think it is ear plug time.
I will have a banana, and finally the ta3meya defrosted.
The ear plugs make everything silent and perfect.
You can call me the ta3meya king.
Also, wake up.
Wake up for real.
Came a decade too late.
lost.host/rss is a thing again
Does not seem as usefull as I expected though.
I expected inline youtube videos.
Are you warm?
Yeah, just save it up. My bank account is basically just savings.
This is the guy we go to every week for fruit and veg.
I wear it whenever.
I wait until toka goes to work then I get changed into it.
Painted Toka's parents' living room pink.
Toka got her new phone and it is ballin.
Might go to the south of Egypt this month when toka gets her week off.
Going to get slippers for my birthd
ay
Ballin means good.
Countrysidish.
Come in.
Join me in my journey to defrost the fool.
Oh wow.
I am almost going to bed.
I have loads but mostly of Toka.
Will you not go back to sleep?
I will get into bed.
With my hot pan of water.
Because I am sleepy. And cold.
Good morning.
Whoa, who are you?!
ENTY AE?
I forgot to follow the rss feed of ECO.
Were you late? Are you fine? Where are you? Do you miss me?
Pffft, big difference between late by accident and late on purpose.
Looks like you are meeting the hunkiest hunk in online chat.
What.
Is it a colouring in but you made it look like you?
You have one dark ear and one white ear.
If you come home with your face painted like this, oxim bellah.
Yeah, bar the ear lobe (singular) and the mouth shape.
Do you have level 6 clearance?
Thiiiiiiiiink.
You look like you need tea.
Do you want pasta pasta for when you get home?
Oh baby lord jesus, christmas presents on btn again.
Last episode of westworld today :O
Are you still here?
Do you still listen to the ambient channel?
Just got limbo and tropico 3 from gog connect. Neither linux, but whatevs.
Where on earth are you?
Phew.
The moto g4 plus is perfection.
I just woke up.
Worried you liked iphones.
You messaged me the instant I woke up.
Someone is rioting up.
Someone is not afraid for the battery to die.
Since yesterday?
I need teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeea.
Send me videos <3
*recordings
a record is a vinyl for playing music.
Records is plural of that
It is also the verb.
But the noun is recording.
I always imagined it yatsi.
If you are university, you can record me a video of you!
I made my audio record command a little easier to use.
Update riot?
Yeah, that is what you should do, I think.
Oh the riot app.
Send me a screen shot of the message you got.
Ewwwwww that UI.
Hmmm.
An inline player is an old issue.
Not seeing anything about this problem though.
Try sending me an audio recording.
If you can.
I can check what it looks like on this phone.
I deleted the file already.
Wait, I can send the link.
Going to update the matrix server, hold on.
Things mariam loves: the direwolves, the series, paul (truly purely), these curtains, how John Snow says "aye", me, Radiohead's album OK Computer, it, me, Mango, ta5moya, it, them, it with bread, your old laptop, hummous, looking at people in the streets, looking at people in their cars in traffic, people with unusual facial expressions, purple, me, this, fixed line internet, Ed Sheeran, us guys, your htc.
Try downloading it and not viewing it in a browser.
Are you in a lecture hall?
I found the search bar in riot.
<3
I feel like typing a lot.
Granted access.
Sounds like level six security clearance.
Are you proud?
I am writing a keyboard layout ;)
It is, but I am adding shit to it.
Do you know what a dead key is?
Correct. Until you press another key.
Tempted to use a dead_capital key.
MARIAM IT IS YOUR VOICE <3
Wait, I will try to download the hello.mp3.
I emailed it.
Pasta for dinner?
Will you be home the normal time today?
Electricity was only 25.5egp.
Is that normal, I do not remember.
as salam alykum, w alykum as salam, hamza eshreen w nos, a, mish 3andy fakah, haha *counts change*, shukran
Wow, I have my own arabic spellings in my head: yatsi kamila.
This is how the sound exists in my head.
Okay, I finished my first draft of the layout revision.
I can change things as I discover oddities.
I should now be able to type all the symbols in the book easily ;;;;;;)
TO THE KITCHEN I GO
My food is best in toowwwn, my food is best in tooown.
Bring washing-up liquid?
You wake up at the dawn of hell.
Hi.
Hello.
Come in.
Yeah I did.
And that it bumps up the performance when docked.
Yeah that would blow.
Just found this in my tea.
Nope, some kind of pod.
Plant.
Bah not a nut, a pod.
Solid shit.
Shit is almost as high level as python.
Atari 2600 - 60fs, xbox one - 30fps.
What were you cleaning?
What will you do not?
now
I just had tea and a kind of nap.
Will you send you?
Your throat, whack, your nose, whack, your lunch, its tight as fuck.
I have the first episode of planet earth season 2.
Teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
Sesame seeeeeeeeeeeds.
Wake up.
WHEN ARE YOU MEETING ME
Been trying to set up the perfect markdown writing environment to type up the book in.
Why did you think I was adding symbols.
I fancy something ricey today.
Any IDEAS?
This flatmate I had once had one and we went into town in it.
Feels insanely powerful.
Yeah, I did not even know it was a pumpkin.
Okay.
Are you home yet.
Why did you die?
Have you been in a sports car?
I think they are mistranslating (a local variety of squash) to pumpkin.
I mean, they call treacle, honey.
Oh shit, my birthday tommorrow.
33% done.
Well, I never do anything, but toka has bought be socks and slippers I think.
What trousers?
Well, it is going to my british account.
It is a saving account mostly so when it is sent is not really important.
Those are toka's trousers.
I would never wear go faster trousers.
Yeah, international transfer, that is not happening though.
Something happened with egyptian currency which made our savings in egyptian pounds worth half as much as before.
So fuck buying any more egyptian pounds.
**** half as much buying foreign currency or goods. Worth the same compared to domestic products.
I understand what happened, and it was a shitty move by the shitty egyptian "government", but is takes time to explain and my hands are cold.
Shh do not tell toka that.
No radiators.
Single glaze windows.
7-9C at night, which make the inside get down to that too.
20-23 in the day.
Are you there?
Hi.
Are you warm.
I will look for music.
Not important any more.
Morrrrning.
to
I could not sleep.
It was getting boring.
Only anxious about that.
By shirt, I hope you mean t-shirt.
Why would I wear a shirt?
They crease easily, are inflexible, less comfortable, and make you sweat more.
At the cost of making me feel worse.
I really need teeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaa.
The entire plan hinges on me wearing a shirt?
No, yes?
Am I wearing jeans too?
Is it coffee and hummous?
Original fucking idea, wow.
Pffffffffffft.
Did mummy even take the tree down yet?
Yeah, I have this photo.
I was a giant.
The guy is piss annoying.
I was the one pushing the biscuit limit higher and higher.
Wake up.
I know you are awake, it is just what I say to make you here.
Some fucking cunt working for the gas company just came took a 2 second look at the boiler and hob, told me I have a gas leak and to call a number.
With his fucking nose.
A guy employed to check for gas leaks, takes two seconds and delcares a strong gas smell.
With his nose.
I think the gas company just outcunted the water company.
I got angry at him for being a lying, corrupt fuck.
I wish he spoke English so I could personally tell him to get fucked.
They guy looked like he snorted so much cocaine he was about to shitplode if he stopped pacing back and forth.
What are you doing today?
I am not that bad.
I am never going to wake up.
I did when I woke up.
I am awake.
Pulling hairs out my chin.
Wondering what tricks and suprises you have lined up.
Will you sleep?
YOU WOULD SAY THAT
No. I woke up at 9am.
I could not sleep.
Okay, leaving.
Yeah, when are they out?
I will call in 48 seconds.
Omg where did you go?
Are they out for long?
Yeah, a bit small to have over socks and my onesie though.
When are they?
Yes.
Happy birthday to you too.
It was in the meredith chat this morning.
Happy birthday to you too.
Wow. Why were you not at my birthday party?
All over cairo.
136,000 people were celebrating it.
Did you do anything for your birthday today?
I forgot to stop the gas on noodles and I had to eat the worst gloopy noodles.
What are you doing now?
Went to eat with toka and now home.
Yeah, I did, and my new jumper.
LEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeee
I accidentally slept.
Talking with Toka around was wierd.
Oh phew you are back.
Did you finish cleaning?
Is your mum's name mariom?
Close enough.
Nickname, but why?
You are marmalade.
Moriam.
Comments, shares, and likes.
Yeah but it was free.
It was a live stream but no longer.
It never happened.
Hi.
No... homemade scrabble.
Me and Nada made scrabble out of two pieces of card.
I would. I would take the money and stop working.
Something to do with youtube favouring videos with higher interaction rates instead of views now.
So deleting it and getting only the active subscribers back would maybe of helped.
Been seeing a lot of youtubers complaining about a drop in income because youtube recommendations favour videos likely to be "viral" instead of actual subscriptions.
The whole thing went to shit when recommended was the homepage over subscriptions.
Happened about a month ago I think.
Youtube is just fucking cest.
I am just really glad they still support rss.
Are you alive.
I woke up.
More specifically, toka woke me up.
Do not drown.
I had an odd dream last night.
Me, toka, and you were in a smallish hotel room.
We were preparing for a trip around russia to another country but the story is long and I will keep it to the part you were in.
We were watching something on T.V, and warning, it gets weird here.
Toka and I decided to just start having sex while you were still watching tv.
After a while toka asked if you wanted to join in and you were so excited.
You did, and I shall not go into detail.
But you bled and then we stopped and you were just so happy you got oral etc.
You went to wash up and came back in a bit and were super enthusiatic and would not let us stop.
Did you prefer I told you or not?
I told Toka when I woke up.
It was nice to see you so happy though.
She thought it was weird.
She said why Marian?
M
I said it was a dream.
Did he answer?
Do not tell Hazem.
Hr will get jealous of Jon snow.
Or that I had dream sex with you.
Hahahaha
Oh I forgot to mention how shy you were in my dream.
Have you never dreamt of it?
I remember a have about nine times.
I
WHY IS IT WEIRD
:(
So you would prefer if I never mentioned it.
Why are you so weird about it.
No. It was a dream, I have talked about these things a lot with everyone.
Where is the mariam that can talk about anything.
Why do you have closed sections.
Yes, but you might find it WEIRD.
Make weird not weird.
What are you doing.
Did you run away and hide?
I need to boil water and drink tea.
Dunky always is.
Westworld season pack is out.
I am almost finished season one of the X-files.
hi
Come in.
Are you scared of me now.
Mariam.
Yeah, not vegan though :(
Tasted like biscuit. It was meant to be half biscuit half cake.
Also, egyptian culture class: when someone makes you a cake, they give you a slice and keep the rest of the cake.
Worst culture ever.
Who knows.
Hi.
I have ate a lot but I am still super hungry.
Or should I say, supef hungry.
Are you awake.
I got into bed.
MORNING
I had a dream that you were finishing just ten minutes of some training course today and then you could come home.
I was so sure it was real.
Drinking up my tea to get the motivation to atom book copy.
Morrrring.
You say that buuuuuuuuut.
WHY
Should I put the book I am copying on lost.host so you can see it?
Does this photo feature a single finger.
The top ranked Go player.
Pretty funny.
AlphaGo seems to be unbeatable currently.
I wonder how chess ai is coming along.
A few places.
Making chiiiiiiiips.
A bit.
Maybe, but they speak fine english.
Yeah, but they are having a 10th aniversary party on my first day so that is awkward.
Making some chips.
Not much food in the house and I am too lazy to go get some.
Oh we have plenty of pasta and rice and vegetables, but I do not want to cook twice in a day.
No microwave, and it does not taste as good when you leave it.
Why are they all from cairo to aswan?
Mariam.
Are you finished the walking dead yet?
Baaaaby.
Is this what you came for?
I need Teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
14 hour train. You will have plenty of time to wait.
Sipping my tea juice.
OMG ARE YOU OKAY DO YOU NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL?
Arabic is after tea.
80% of episode 2, 40% of episode 3, 23% of episode 4.
Wait, 80%, 44%, and 33%.
I thought they lived in Alexandria.
Okay arabic time.
The book is a little blurry. Is fi a long vowel or a short?
For "in"
paul fi toka
Are you ready to test my I-VOCABULARY when you are home?
Jeez, clears up a lot of fog.
ismi, my name
imshi, I walk.
I mean, it makes sense; you can not own a verb, and you can not be the subject of a noun, but somehow knowing the rule makes it so much clearer what is going on.
Marriarmiram.
Any cravings for dinner?
I finished lesson 1 bar the place names. So I guess we can do some exercises together.
Shower super clean time.
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr cooooollddd.
Did you give noura a row?
Telling off.
Stomach is growling.
I think it is misa3a2a day, riiiiiiiiiiight?
Mariam.
I had to remove the top layer of rice you put in because it was covered in mould.
Hahaha
Oh wow you almost caught up.
The mid season finale of 7 was great.
Mariam.
Does my photo not help?
I just tried to send a six second video three times and the third time it finished (15MiB) and it complained it was too large.
Have you ever seen a video of me?
It was just raining.
Need. Tea.
Doing some http server things so expect a bit of downtime.
At least on the riot web.
Seems to be okay, right?
Yeah.
Going to change the address to lost.host/riot
Or should I do matrix?
riot it is
Okay, finished messing with shit now.
Mariam.
Pretty interesting. It does not block anything with lists, it detects when a site is tracking and then blocks it.
And under the eff name.
Fixed my mouse by sticking two layers of paper on top of the switch.
Tiny bit squishier, and not as clicky, which takes a little getting used to, but having every second click not register or count as a keyrelease, that was driving me crazy.
BABY
ALL ALONE APPARRENTLY
I took it apart back then when you said you cleaned yours, but mine did not have a speck of dirt in it, bar the mouse wheel.
So I put it together and it took until today to get mad enough at it to try to fix it.
I guess something is wrong inside the switch.
I did, but I feel like more.
I just started hiwars.
hiwars wi ana wi ana wi ana.
Hmmmm
Forks are pretty efficient.
My mouse has taken a lot of incremental game damage.
Oh I can use symbols here.
Cups are pretty efficient.
I put a peice of paper in the mouse and now it works.
I wonder if I press the space bar more than I click.
I think I probably do.
But then the optical sensor does way more work than the mouse click.
My headphones are still tanking with an average of ~3 hours a day.
My nuc is what, two years old and has been on around 98% of the time, but it is expensive.
My pi goes in and out of use.
Cheap though.
The server has been around 99% for quite a while.
I wish my keyboard had a built in heater.
And the mouse.
I can feel them, they get stiff and numb.
I finished the dialogues. Going to leave speaking and understanding them to either after I study the vocab and grammar, or you help me.
What should I eat?
But you have dancing.
Nope, no left over cold food.
When will you be home?
Only three hours.
I will just have a lemon and tahini and a peice of bread.
Hmmmm.
I only got that message on my phone.
Oh, it was a text.
Gary where are you.
Are you alive.
Astroneer looks pretty great.
No linux though.
I watched some gameplay of it and it would be fun to play together. Maybe when a torrent comes out I will install windows if you want.
The game looks great too though.
" Discrete GPU with 1 GB Ram "
What does it matter that the gpu is discrete?
You do not see games list a discrete sound card any more.
Have to keep an eye on gg in two days for it.
I woke up.
Oh I have to see.
Mariamam.
The update for riot makes it load ten times faster.
Yahoo just announced that they just found out in 2013, they lost (was stolen) user data for 1B accounts.
I found a better editor. One that tells me mistakes and has headerless tables.
Have you considered making a btn subscription for small torrents somehow? Just to get to 1500.
Like episode only, sd, scene.
Mariam come back.
Going to Aswan in two days. Toka is off for a week now.
What about Mary?
You have not sent a photo of the Christmas decorations yet.
WHERE IS THE CHRISTMAS DECORATION PHOTO
Lisa said she is going to burn that leaf thing.
Did you come back?
Hi.
I thought you left.
I can.
Going on holiday for a week so next week.
I will leave the download till I get back because it is small and could be updated.
Yes. I want to see both of you.
Just me since the new phone.
We always wear the same stuff.
Wake up.
We are going to aswan today.
four or five days.
We are going with someone called miram.
So you are close.
Miram.
We are leaving in 25 minutes.
The train ride leaves at 11pm and is 13 hours long.
I know I know but iOS only.
Okay.
Anyone who wants to put money in there, feel free :D

I am home.
Nope, just got home.
That is pretty bad, right?
But then again, if they can manage xbc on the wii u.
No signs of christmas over here.
I just got home.
Back now.
Before you spend it all?
Should have quite a few photos to show you.
Pretty sure those are the only required details. Name is up to you.
Type is visa, but visa has nothing to do with bank transfers, only card transactions.
The name of the bank is only important for international transfers.
This is my uk account.
Pffft, unless it is computer parts.
Or a new onesie.
Updated synapse to 0.18.5
Did it work fine now?
Yes.
I will have so many photos.
They are on my computer now so do.
It was fine.
It is nice to be home now though.
Yeah.
It was good.
You will see it soon.
In no order.
I will send from the PC, it fails here.
I MISSED YOU MARIAM
We went for a nap.
I can check in a bit but it usually takes a day or two, also the working hours at Christmas time are different.
23/12/2016\t23/12/2016\tTransfer from C Meredith (30-80-55/51118868), ref. PAUL MEREDITH10.00\t\t303.89
Come in.
Yeah, it went in.
Will do :)
Good morning.
No, but I think he was trying to chat while I was away.
So maybe.
No signs of christmas at all here
Kind of crept up on me.
Snow, christmas lights, shops selling cards, trees, people talking about it.
For a population 10% christian, they seem to be either repressed, or shy.
The Christians do.
I have lots more, but you owe me now :D
CHRISTMAS EVE
There are no signs of Christmas here. It crept up.
Are you and Jane doing anything for it?
We just got back from the very south of Egypt. I will send some photos once I shrink and pick them.
Felt a lot more like Africa down there.
The blurriest photos as usual.
Not sure how you take so blurry and small photos with such an expensive phone.
Lisa never sends any photos.
This is our currency.
Kind of, that part of the building had no roof.
Of course it has your unique style.
You do.
102948.
It is Christmas tomorrow so you can wrap them too.
And videos.
Hi.
I am here.
It will take me another day to adjust to being up at night.
I do not know user names and passwords.
Just click forgot password.
gol article about astroneer coming to linux.
Okay, Toka's parents' time.
Are we meeting after?
Today?
A weekend.
Yes.
Hi.
I am home.
It is tea, then cleaning time.
I cry every time I go to what.cd
Where did the community go? Surely there must be refugees ready to start anew.
PTH whatever that is.
No.
Why do you say?
He likes to make public posts about things that should be private.
He has not talked to me this christmas, but makes a public announcement about it.
Begging for attention by using feelings, if you ask me.
You know how I feel about facebook.
But I am here.
Do not say that.
Just be here a lot.
No excuses.
If you value here enough you will find a way.
I mean, I have been there.
But I just gave up.
People used to never see me sleep.
Ignore the christmas song though.
Eugh.
Wrong link, now you know how much I hate google.
Maybe.
Link me for later.
Knock it out?
You can make up now.
MERRY CHRISTMAS
I will check when I get up.
I will make tea after I poo.
Yeah, 220 went in yesterday. Looking a bit healthier now. Thank you :)
I have tea.
What are you doing.
It is christmas.
Pouring boiling water in my pockets.
No extraterrestrial signs?
You have to open your mind, toka.
**spits seed**
You check the computer while I follow this guy and see an alien.
Oh wow, truly a charlie's angel now.
Also colon toka, colon.
Is she nervous?
Does she ask you everything?
I will always be there.
So go call your parents, and tell the the good news.
Say you've fallen hard and that there's someone who needs to meet you.
We'll pick out a white dress and grab two golden bands.
At least he will have his mind occupied today.
But by which demon, scully?
Enough so that you can spend all your time talking to hot hunk in your area.
Time for some programming and music.
I do not know how you hold pee in in the morning. I have been three times already.
DOUBLE IN PARTY
NO SAD
SAYID
Just remember what ream means in English.
This is my job today.
And it is daunting.
"To form, shape, taper, or enlarge (a hole or bore, for example) with or as if with a reamer."

They added self signed certificate support and submitted the code proposal.
Oh shit, I am official.
Did you know riot supports markdown?
### Welcome
#### Todo

Eat mashy?
Eat nothing?
Leaving in twenty minutes.
Yes.
I had some fool in the morning.
Not enough time.
I don't have five minutes.

Wait, I tihnk I can reset it.
Okay, see if she can log in with password Firesong
I am home.

No need, log in with lisa and Firesong
Yeah.
Firesong has a capital
lisa does not
She should know.
No. Just lisa.
I had some fool and ta3meya and mashy and molokhaya.
Hello.
I am sure she will wear it once she learns it keeps her warm on walks.
Wake up.
Baaaaaby.
If I wake up before you any day, do you want tea?
I will make turkish tea :D
Mariamrmam.
Think we are going to try to make peanut butter today.
Finally.
DISHES DONE
I hmmm.
I went to a place to meet nada to help her with a camera.
Then went with her to get food and play backgammon.
Where did you go?
Why is it so cold.
Thought you died.
Yeah.
Dying for pasta.
Why.
Hi.
Nope. Maybe tomorrow.
Not used to being tired at this time.
The trip away messed up my usual sleeping.
So what did you and lisa get for christmas?
Hair straighteners and slippers?
Mariam.
Almost sleeping.
I have diarrhea too.
I have never idea. The time is changing.
Today was 7:20
I did.
She?
I did message him but he does not log in.
Those are nice flower photos frames.
I am going to some wedding to day to help Nada be the photographer.
Well, it is freezing and cloudy and I have to go to azhar park.
We did not really know what the event was.
Oh, I have no idea what this part is. Not the actual wedding but also not a photoshoot.
I have to be there at 1pm.
Are you at university?
Do you ever get any?
1111111115
Which bus has heaters in?
Who is in the hospital?
I am here but I am off to a wedding right now.
Like stepping out of the door right now.
Yes.
Leaving now.
Are you sure about 18?
Why did he not go to a GP?
Why did you take him?
The photos were very very good.
Ignore the read thing for me.
It means the computer got it, but I was not here.
Okay, I will send a short email.
acupuncture... what the hell.
I have but I should probably not talk about it.
7-8 years ago.
I think the difference this time is that he has not hid it.
Okay I sent an email.
Just talking about things we have done recently.
It was just the photo shoot part in a park.
Nada took some great photos.
I carried all the bags and helped her when she wanted to know about settings.
It was good.
I am so cold.
A family gathering for photos in wedding attire.
Not yet.
Always falling asleep.
Baaaaby.
Maybe if I am in them.
Someone is hungryyyyy.
Did Nada leave us these noodles?
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Did you take the pill last night? I think I was asleep.
Someone slept a lot.
Just because of early mornings.
TEA TIME
Ohhh was it good?
No.
What for?
Are you alive?
How do you feel?
I feel like programming but I am not sure what.
You forgot to take the SD card.
Nada really should have taken it.
You are taking one bus to Almaqarr?
I wish I did.
Baaaaaaaaby.
WHO IS COMING HOME SOON.
No. Stop it.
I feel as cold as ice.
Not yet.
Maybe when toka gets home.
I just spend 16 games in a row of chess lossing to this malaysian guy.
Finally I beat him and quit haha
Getting rid of the out bits of the peanuts.
The skins.
I made it. It looks and tastes good.
No need to add any oil.
It just 
does.
Goes dry but then becomes oily and sticky.
When toka gets home with the phone.
Saving it all until toka gets home.
Ultimate self control.
Peanuts are pretty expensive.
Wake up.
I made peanut butter yesterday.
HELLO OLD FRIEND
 hi
Just had some with bread for breakfast.
Tastes like home.
Are you tead up and fine?
They do not make loafs of bread here though.
Not you.
They do not make loafs of bread here.
They make flat breads.
My mum wondering why everyone does not have toasters.
Not worth having a toaster for though.
Nope. I sent him an email but nothing.
I stopped even checking because the currency change.
I mean the embassy should contact her and return her passport with the visa.
Checking the site just gives us a little bit of notice.
If the flights to hurghada are cheaper, you could go there, we meet you and take a train up to cairo.
Eh, cairo seems to be cheaper.
335 return with british airways.
From inverness.
Jesus, the exchange rate is not 1 to 23.5.
now
Yeah I remember you applying.
Well, considering the british pound is at it weakest ever, and the exchange rate was 1 to 10 4 months ago.
Both the uk currency and the egyptian are falling very fast, but the egyptian faster.
Best to convert all our money into japanese yen or something.
In a country that is not falling to peices.
Hahahaha
But there is another peice of bread sooooooooooo.
It is the best, but I will leave you **some**.
It reminds me of home a lot but the taste of the bread is completely different.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Where are you.
No.
I am ice.
Did you wake up too fast?
Panic is the normal after fainting.
Sleeping.
What are you doing?
Hi.
He has not replied yet.
Not a web developer but yeah, trainee.
Yeah, I use indeed jobs.
Egypt has it's own versions of it though.
used
Me playing the gameboy on a potty in a tent?
HI MARIAM <3
I only got home an hour or so ago.
But we got coco powder and had hot chocolate which was fantastic.
Toka's Parents' then we went to downtown with them, then we went to the spice shop.
Nothing.
I hope warmly.
Oh wow it is late.
I have not been this late in a week.
Toka is still not home.
Where is toka.
Toka come home.
youtube: if playback does not start shortly, try restarting your device.
A***** advice youtube.
Yeah.
Embedded though.
Will you send me a song?
Toka is making Cinnamon rolls today.
Maybe.
I did not even think it until you clarified.
I know this song.
Yiruma does very romancy music.
It is the most famous.
Some.
I woke up to the phone ringing thinking it was my alarm so I casually let it ring out.
Yeah.
Oh, I tead, but let me take out fool.
Good morning.
Sure, I have hot chocolate.
At least it did not explode!
Cold here too; wearing a jumper underneath my onesie.
You have radiators.
Just some programming.
Not lately, but toka make cinnamon rolls yesterday.
Okay, just remind me when it does.
Yeah, I do.
Are you fine?
I am okay. I had tea, hot chocolate and fool.
Do you want to do anything today?
I am programming lots.
Either in the cable box in the living room (the wicker thing), or in my room next to my bed.
But I think there should be two downstairs.
In the wicker baskets in the giant square shelf thing.
Two of them have cables and stuff.
Is she not home?
Well, there is one plugged into the back of the tv.
Maybe a spare one is not plugged in back there.
I KNOW
One is connected from the server to the tv on top of it.
Did you find it?
But I said it was connected to the server upstairsi
Hi.
Mooornnnging.
The alarm is at 9:45.
Do not remember changing it.
Will you miss him?I have tea and hard poop.
When did that washing go out?
What kind of sick.
WHY
Did you have too much coffee and lemon?
Fool, I will make hot chocolate.
WHAT DID YOU EAT
Suuuuuuuuuuure. I bet you had a kilogramme of noodles.
Oh yeah, sure blame noura for not getting all the work done.
Oh wow. Did you miss university,
I have hot chocolate.
When was the last time you had special K?
Started making my own incremental game a few days ago.
Basic as fuck right now.
Using gopherjs, so I can code in go and compile to js.
Javascript is just a bug trap.
The ability to declare globals within local scope, and no such thing as block scope. It kills everything.
I made some hot juice from the stuff you make juice from in ramadan.
I have no idea.
It makes purply juice.
Morrrrning.
I probably should have ignored the alarm today.
Who knows?
I am too <3
He hired you because you are female, what do you expect?
He hires pretty females for his front-face.
He does not have to admit sexism to be a sexist.
There is no way on earth he did not judge the quality of a candidate by appearance. 
And when he comments on your appearance being less desirable.
Wait until he overrides your judgement for no reason other than they look good.
Just ignore him and do the work.
Rather be reem he is carressing. 
And as long as you are the best at the work, he really should keep his mouth shut.
Be fine honeybun <3
It is music time.
I went to the toilet came back and wondered why the music stopped.
My headphones were off my head.
I think it is foooooooooool time.
Yuuuum.
Mmmmmmmmm hot chocolate.
What?
I have the interview at 2pm tomorrow.
Haha yeah.
You did not phone them again did you? I want to know they actually read the email and cv this time.
Shower time. I am ice.
I have an interview tomorrow for a programming job.
Are you home yet?
Just a small company. I saw photos of their cramped office space. Just hope the interview is in private at least.
Pay is nothing compared to the UK.
As long as they are not too intimidating. 2pm, pretty near by I think.
Trying to find it on a map now.
Oh, might be very close.
3km maybe.
Yeah, have not been over that way before though so I might take toka's phone and use gps.
I think it is a 40 minute walk, but not in the usual direction. 
The other side of that giant empty space near us.
Hello.
ARE YOU DONE YET
HAVE YOU LEFT YET.
Yeah I got it. Good to hear from him.
I never reply to emails immediately.
Do you never chat in meredithish
Hello Marmia Moriadium.
Very very cold.
Will you send you.
Yeah. It was good, I should install it again.
Morning.
I hear 1 is a very good game.Yeah, I played it. It was good, stopped because I got pissed at dying. 
Half 12.
Got tea and shower.
Ate hard rice.
Sim is not working so I hope they do not phone and I can find the place.
No idea.
How did you get the map of the 10th district?
I got it.
I got the exact point on maps.me
Leaving.
Baaaaby.
Just got a job as an android developer.
I got the job.
I went to the dot on the map and there was nothing there. So I searched all the streets and did not see any signs.
I asked a random guy to use his phone.
I called you but it did not work, so I called the office and the guy took me there.
It was exactly where the dot was but there was no sign.
The interview was by two android developers, I answered almost all the answers easily, and the guy was a bit surprised that I do not claim to have much experience.  
It was with those two, hr, and magdy.
They are all very nice.
My English is a little hard for some of them though.
ANNNNYYY WAY, I START SATURDAY
And I got a lift home by magdy.
The hours are somewhat flexible, 8-9am to 4-5pm, and you get paid by how many hours. 7.5 hours a day will get me 2500 for the first month, then I sign a contract for a year at 3000. I queried about working late and no one does so that is good.
Their weekend is thursday and friday.
There is a 10th anniversary party on saturday. There are 20 people working morning shift. 4 current android developers. ONE IS A FEMALE?!
We get a nice private room for android only.
They have a bath and two bathrooms.
The other room is bigger and has ios, web, and design.
They are buying me a computer and I can install anything I want on it.
I better spend the next 4 days refreshing my memory on Android :D
In magdy's office with the two android guys and hr.
I am super excited.
So are they.
The rooms are bigger than in the photos. It is clean too.
The people I met seemed nice. There is an iOS guy who is super anti-google.
I even got it expressing how much I hate java, object orientation, and google.
SAY SOMETHING
I look so short in the jeans photo.
Like I have tiny legs and a giant torso.
Second photo: last time we held hands.
Remember that piece of furniture?
Do not tell many people.
Privacy.
Like do not post it on social media.
Personally tell people.
If you can not tell them personally, they do not need to know.
TIME TO TAP SO MUCH
And have hot chocolate.
I HAVE A PROGRAMMING JOB.
One of the iOS developer's is getting a medal and three people getting certificates.
Madgy.
100% sure he founded the company 10 years ago.
They have two shifts. 8-5, 5-12 ish.
He is very nice.
Most of their English is enough for me to understand them, but they speak with major pauses.
But I am not sure if they get 50% of what I say.
There is no android back shift right now.
Nah, it is good enough. 
They will get used to me.
I am so so cold.
7.5 hours a day, 8-9am to 4-5pm, weekends on thursday and friday.
I start this saturday.
They are buying me a computer.
By being warm?
WITH DOUBLE NOODLES.
Mariam, I have news.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ON SATURDAYS
Pay periods are from 25th of each month, salary for that month paid on the following 5th.
So I should get 1607 on the 5th next month.
Then 3000 every 5th after that.
35 minute walk at a casual morning speed, so I should leave at 7:18 each day.
When do you leave?
The android guy interviewing me was shocked that I first started on Android 3.5ish years ago. He said he started 10 months ago.
Do you even wake up before I leave.
Well, working on it 5 days a week for ten months.
I was like, "back in my days the design patterns were like this, but these days there are a few new ones", then the guy said the new one.
WHO IS SALMA
BIRO IS A PEN
The base amount first, then the fixed amount based on how good I am.
I think the 3000 was just to give me a number.
I really do not expect to be paid more than the person with a computer science degree, or someone who has worked on the projects for a long time.
Does not matter, PROGRAMMING JOB.
You can leave and arrive late if you want.
You log in and out.
I can arrive at 9am, and leave at 4am.
Each department deals with one application at a time.
No idea what they are working on right now on android.
<3<3<3<3
Do not tell your dad I am not paid in dollars in an international school.........
I do not think you should have hide it from me.
hid
I brought up operating system and computers, because I was wondering about my keyboard layout.
He said I can install whatever I want, so I said good I will take my own keyboard.
He then gave me a tour and introduced me to everyone, and showed me the keyborads.
I expected them to have good keyboards, but no. So he is going to shit himself when he sees mine.
Or... everyone is going to hate me because the typing is too loud.
If they want me to work slower, fine. Otherwise, endure the click.
Oh god, they are not going to comprehend the new new one.
They have a 4 (Megabyte he said), but probably a 4 Mibibit connection shared with 15-20 people.
Which could be pretty bad.
When a new android virtual machine image is 400-700 MiB, and the android environment is 1.5GiBish.
Maybe it really is a 4Megabyte connection.
But that is faster than adsl2 max, so I doubt it.
No hahaha.
They all decided to make thursday a weekend because the traffic is better on a saturday and there are people who travel from alexandria and places each week...
Oh, I get a 1 hour break a day, whenever I want.
Which is way more than I am used to.
Yeah, each week.
They rent a flat in cairo so why not just live in it.
Sure.
Every weekend going to alexandria to visit your family...
I have no idea.
ARE YOU HOME YET
I want noooooooooooooodooools.
We need to go for fool, ta5732a and bread too.
I could leave thirty minutes later.
But to start I will be there 8 sharp.
Until I am comfortable.
By the time the bus leaves I could already be half way there.
30 minutes is a good commute time. 
Spending 15 minutes on a micro bus cramped up with people, for money...
I had to leave for work at 4:30am to start getting paid and working at 6am, then leave at 12:45pm to start at 2pm. On my previous shifts.
Here it is leave 7:20 to start at 8am.
It is a converted apartment on the third floor.
Two nice bathrooms :P
A CORNER BATH
I need to pee sooo much.
Huuuunnnngrryyyy.
OKAY FOUR NOODLES
I would have a tomato but it is too cold.
CELEBRATING WITH NOODLES IN FOOL
I now have a record of getting a job on the second interview.
WAKE UP
EWYOU
MIX IT TOGETHER WITH SOME WATER AND BILE AND STOMACH JUICES
Hahaha.
Novocarmena is cheaper, right?
Are they drugs now?
You have to buy them from a friend of a friend in a dark alley.
US dollars only.
My teeth.
You pointing at the floor on your tip toes.
Yeah, but there are backshift people too, and some people are on holiday. So I did not see everyone.
Still, one more than I expected.
Being the only female there would be a bit daunting.
Not yet, when she gets home from work in an hour or two.
Yeah, but good that android has its own room and is small :D
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
DLESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
ARE THEY THERE YET?
Anything. It is a company of 30ish people who make ios, android, and web applications for clients.
5 people on the android team.
Unless you mean making mad dough, in which case no, this is Egypt bro.
Not sure what they are working on right now. But I get my own computer and can install whatever on it.
Yeah, single device, better performance code.
But I would rather not touch iOS, objective c, or use their design guidelines.
iOS is a disaster to use.
I have given up on all languages bar Go now, it is just a joy to program in.
But pay me and I will program in Java.
It got worse.
You can not edit a misspelled word. You have to delete it or select a correction.
The icons are designed in mspaint / ms office.
It looks like a fucking bouncy castle.
And it still has a tiny ass resolution.
I remember it not having 3g.
I got the job while telling them how much I hate java, google, and OO.
There was the main iOS guy, he also hates google, I shared some hate with him then told him I hate all the stuff he likes too.
More iOS.

I wonder if Chris is still a mac guy.
I think he never had an iPhone, right?
Just a macbook pro.
Have you heard from him in the last decade?
Asking for payment on some bills he found.
Not since you moved apart?
I wonder if I can find him on gtalk.
No idea, they launched two new messaging platforms this year.
Allo, and something else.
Ah, think I found him.
He has to accept a chat invitation, from Mr. Smith.
Where do you think he lives?
Do you think he made it to Norway or Iceland?
I am actually curious. 
My sister sends me information about people I once knew sometimes and it can be a laugh.
I think Stuart has a child.
Which is crazy.
Stuart Ruthven.
Left 4th year.
Never heard from him since.
He was my best friend through primary, lived 1s away from me.
Along with Jack summers. 5s away.
I mean, my sister only tells me when people die, or have children.
A pretty good filter.
Not interested in anyone from after high school though.
Manly the primary school people.
Mainly
Just nice to know someone ended their life literally or metaphorically. 
My dad was in hospital boxing day for suicidal thoughts or something.
My mum and sister told me but he has not yet.
I mean, it is not the first time.
Yeah do not worry, I have no feelings.
I miss a good pc game though.
In general.
It has been a while.
Nothing low-end and fun come out?
We should get a game of HOI IV on the go (I only played for 10 hours so have no idea how things work), turn the AI right down, you be the USSR, I will be Germany.
xomed at or however you spell his name.
I heard the lag is real in it though.
Does look fun though.
tohuogh.
Frankie BatteryCharger 
When I played it, it really was.
Takes a lot of time to get into a game though.
tohugh
Of game notifications?
I want borderlands 3.
Did you play the version after 2?
The pre-sequel was by a different company?
Weapon modding would be good.
Yeah xom.
Is it on linux...?
I watched uncharted 4, was a good watch.
Long.
Just over a GiB I think.
Tomorrow might be the best day.
Do you have a permalink?
tar.xz, a good start.
I played 1.0, so I expect half the gameplay to be different.
We are both complete noobs right?
You will host, but we will not be able to 3,4, or 5x speed because of my internet.
Which is fine because we are new to it.
I wake up at around 7am your time, so just message me when you are ready.
Europa Universalis. 
Stellaris? 
Stellaris should have had a tonne of updates by now.
Victoria?
Required opengl 4.0 though.
Which, btw, I should have support for as soon as the patchset to activate it is merged.
The fp64 patchset merged today.
Yeah.
Only one thing blocking 4.5 I think.
On windows it only has 4.3, I think.
Where are you.
Gaiaonline
Forum + avatar + clothes + items.
Summarised it with four words for you.
It was some old anime forum but it had currency and avatars and items.
2004, wow.
Oh, it had a fishing game too.
Did you sign up for it?
Yeah.
Nah, I am not as involved with the stats.
Yeah but they have books with stat modifiers.
And avatars.
Seen any good stuck in a virtual world mystery animes recently?
be like what with its
I watched dot hack a long time ago.
Oh.
I got a job.
As an android developer.
On November 6, 10,000 players log into the SAO's mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out.
Sounds pretty similar.
7.82, damn.
I am still in season 2 of x-files.
Yeah, pretty decent.
Like an adult goosebumps.
I know you told me to stop at 6 or something.
But I watched cube 2, cube: hypercube, and cube zero.
Okay, going to go for a bit.
Pay is standard, but more important is me getting working experience in it.
I was interview by one of the programmers, basically just a technical interview.
Yeah, that is what I mean.
Why do you have a ps4...?
Do the seasons get shorter?
All 3 months, eh?
xom
I start this Saturday and it is 30 minutes walk from my house.
Magdsoft.
Okay, now toka saw them.
"aaaw cute"
I think have have about 100 on the server.
Does it not use the linux kernel?
I get thursdays and fridays off.
Wake up.
CES is now?
Did you see grumpy? I think it is a google project that convert python to go.
Wow, an m.2 WD nvme pcie 3.0 x4 512GB 2050/800MB/s sequential, 170/134k 4KB iops, for 199USD.
Not sure when my next drive will be, but for sure pcie nvme m.2.
Use an m.2 sata right now.
I think not, but I do know how to get to the coffee shop now.
By bus.
I just drink green tea though.
I can not believe someone is going to pay me to program. 
The what?
Hand in
Did we take my pendrive home?
That sounds like you did not sudo it.
Where are you.
When do they finish?
And when do you finish all of them?
I am home.
Oh only a week.
I usually just have two large weak coffees a day.
You have my calendar.
Moorrrrning.
I just ate chips so now hot chocolate.
Wake up mother fucker.
I think I forgot.
Ready to voice chat?
I always feel cold.
I have to wake up at 6:30.
Want to continue?
(if yes give me ~15 minutes for a disk copy to finish)
Oh yes.
I will have fateer.
Are you back?
Shall I restart?
Yes.
Haha it was for benq
Good. How I like them.
Yeah, but these are fried until really crispy then with salt and vinegar. 
HI
Morning.
But what will you do.
Cold.
Are you alive.
Probably a bit late for me now.
I had it.
I ran out.
I am.
Of course the pen drive did not work.
So I had to work around and now I have my stuff on it.
It is much better than mine. But it has a hdd, so everything loads slowly.
I was the second here.
I have all my files.
Not many people here.
A xeon e5620, 12GiB of ram.
I am fine, just not much to do right now.
Haha yeah. I never thought about you using it.
I think they are too busy planning a party.
No idea. I have finished setting everything up.
Any idea if it is worth using nvidia drivers for a 7300gt?
Is it even useful to use?
Who is the interview with?
I have peed about 8 times.
No idea. Check the disabled apps?
Worked out the box with no xf86 drivers.
Do you mean on the phone or on the computer?
The computer you open a terminal and write: record name.wav   and then control + c to cancel it. But keyboard.
There might be a chrome extension to do it.
I did install a virtual keyboard in chrome for you but I did not test it.
Does it work at all?
I think they are still supported, but I do not think I will be using it for 3d.
The 2d seems to work fine without.
Are you going to make dinner :O
I mean noodles, but also pasta, or anything, or fattah.
What do you want?
I will give you a message when I leave.
Should be 40-45 minutes after that.
The times might be way more flexible than I thought.
They use a online system thing to track your work time.
I think people just come in whenever they want.
Yeah, I guess. I will still give it a few more days.
Maybe today is odd.
It is very cold though.
Heading in a few minutes.
I can play in a bit if you want.
Not sure when, but a bit.
45 minutes.
Maybe less.
Now?
Restarting.
Google locked me out of my account...
Yeah.
Hello?
My password is monkey
On the moto g
Not bad, but I had no real work to do.
No one really did anything.
Sure, for some of it.
Can you send that security code,
Wait, it might only be on my account.
Under Services, tap Security. Then tap Security code to get your code.
Where
Whrhrhrhr
Maybe, thanks.
Yeah, I did the other option.
Love you.
I am awake and at my second day.
I got my computer set up as I like.
But the project leader was not here so I never got into the code.
My hands are ice.
Probably can not say.
A private exam?
Did you take the exam?
Wow, corruption.
I am home.
Better today. They are really early on in the project so far.
What is this a photo session?
He's looking very old now.
Are you alive.
AGDQ on twitch.
Me too.
My latest bedtime is now 12:30.
It is good.
The walk is too cold though.
3.1km or 40 minutes.
One way.
I would rather walk because it is cheaper and healthier.
And I will never support uber or careem.
Hi.
Tell him he should not be the typical business owner and treat his employees like robots.
Leave at 5 sharp and encourage everyone else to.
He is nothing without his labour force.
Article 80.
I did not read it, I had to do something.
9x5 is 45, so it is fine.
Since it says or.
Wait, I have stuff to do.
The hour break is interesting.
Also, "Incomputing the account for the period of the weekly days of rest added togeth, it shall be observed that the period begins from the hour of the works' arrival at the nearest site where means of transport are provided and ends at the hour of their return to it.
It counts from the bus stop.
No more than ten hours a day inclusive of 1 hour rest.
Overtime is paid at a minimum of 135% for day, 170% for night. 
Article 85, if you have a day of rest used for overtime, the employer shall grant another day in lieu of that day during the following week.
So if you are made to work saturday, you should get a day of next week.
But strict limit on 10 hours a day.
Article 86.
The employer shall place on the main gates used by the workers for entry, and also on a prominent place in the establishment, a schedule for the weekly day of rest, the working hours, the break periods determined for each worker, and all changes to be introduced in that schedule.
Also, article 88, everything applies to women.
Coming home.
Are you home.
Shall I restart?
Mariam.
I have the last hot chocolate.
And cooking fateer.
I wear two t-shirts and two jumpers to work, with a hat and gloves.
Yay, she used my code.
Morning.
But if you are paying 5000usd for it, I think you probably do not care at that point.
I can barely even look at my monitor.
With HDR, I really would not want white being 255,255,255.
Coming home in 15 minutes.
I want only photos of the sun being max values.
So you know, Thursday is the only day I have off and Toka does not. So Thursdays can be long gaming days if you want.
I can Friday evening too, but not as long as Thursday.
It is great.
It is my hobby.
3000 a month for 7.5*5*4 hours.
When are you free.
xom
Yeah, I agree about one cable and no mst.
No idea, brightness is a seperate value I think.
Are you fine.
I am fine.
I have had three today.
Good.
How is everyone?
Why are you wasting time on that?
Ohhhh.
He did it through your company.
Hahahahahaha.
Edam cheese?
HOW ARE YOU.
I have the strongest tea ever.
Leaving in five minutes.
Are you done.
Wait, is it switch news tomorrow?
Should have told her you already have mushrooms growing under your sink.
I got a grow your own bonzi tree but I never planted it.
I think I lost the seed.
Holy shit, are you drunk?
Mariam. We have not talked much this week.
So we have the next two days to talk a week's worth.
I woke up.
Show me.
Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.
Why would I be?
Freelance programming is a race to the bottom.
I have one project to concentrate on.
What I am interested in is having TEA AND FOOL <3
I call it the TOOL BREAKFAST.
***** after the tea
War in an hour?
Not enough for a snow man.
We have sand.
Now?
Windows downloaded all those shitty games again last time we played.
No, will now.
If you say yes.
BABY
GAMING HARD WITH BVEN
????????????????????
You call.
................................................
What?
Not had that problem in forever.
Refresh riot.
I heard you for a second there.
Did you refresh riot?
My ping is fine
Both restart computer and router?
Wait.
Close the game.
No lost packets.
What the hell
Accidentally clicked the close button.
What were you saying?
It is good.
Can you load lost.host/riot these days?
Seems to take a long time.
Is it because the videos are too big?
Never tried sending videos here before.
Not much there.
We have more snow than that.
We have yellow snow.
As usual.
Not yet. 
Ah, okay, will have a look soon.
It really depends on who operates in the lossie exchange with fibre, and who provides a static IP.
Built in infinite research is going to be good.
Mining productivity 32 :D
Talktalk and sky are the only operators in lossie other than bt.
The problem with all three is they try to sell you add on shit like television, telephone, tele everything.
Just checking which company has the better consumer ratings.
Sky, talktalk, and BT all rated just under three stars.
The problem is that if the internet is not working, the only people who can do anything about it are BT.
Talk talk, sky, etc they can not touch BT's equipment.
And since they were a public monopoly, and then privatly sold, they have an almost infrastructure monopoly.
However, the speed at the house in lossie is limited to a level which is provided by the package below, I think.
And, I can look into using a dynamic DNS, perhaps we can get rid of the static ip with a seperate service, then we can switch back to BT residential, and get rid of the 24 hour repair service thing.
I will look into that tomorrow though.
Another thing, you can pay the line rental yearly, which saves around 20% on line rental I think.
Since line rental is 17 or so a month, that adds up.
Or we could go the cheap route.
Might be possible to get unlimited internet for 215 a year.
But at 2.5 times slower, which you would probably not notice.
That should include line rental, which would be insanly cheap. But I will look more tomorrow.
It is not slow. that is the house wifi.
Baaaby.
You can close it.
Ah, it is not too bad.
Do you get much time there?
Everyone here is going to Dreampark on thusday. You have work but you are invited if you want to be sick or off or something.
Do you want to ask for the day off maybe?
50EGP each, we will all leave from the office. Not sure about transport.
I have no idea what it is like
HEADING HOME.
Me too.
Did you like the music.
Babbby.
:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
I can not smile at work, it would be embarrasing.
We should be at the office at 9am on thursday.
No, but is it important?
Are you fine?
I have pooed twice and peed four times.
Are you alive.
Coming home in five minutes.
Hello mariam.
What is it. I have no sound and twitter videos require cookies.
A LITTLE HUNGRY
HOW ARE YOU
I was told explicitly yesterday that I should not take breaks for the toilet. So I should have a slightly shorter day now.
SWAMPED IN PEE?
40 more minutes.
Leaving in five minutes.
BE HOME SOON.
I WILL CALL AT 5:05ish.
I am home.
mar
Did you like the music.
Finished season 2 of x-files last night.
They really end seasons like a realy asshole.
Not so much of an issue for me because I have the next season, but people watching it at the time.
This is somewhat satisfying.
Yeah, but the presenter is pretty brutal and direct.
Well, she aligns her frequencies with nature.
She is killing herself in the test.
And she is still persistant.
She did not die :(
Opengl 4.5 support for haswell very soon.
Yeah.
Last time it was ** not including haswell.
Still downloading divinity.
43%.
Might be up for some hoi if toka goes out tonight.
No idea when though.
Yeah, no, I agree completely.
Oh wow, I had twenty odd I think. I think I finally got the hang of the battle plans too. It was good practice.
It is easy enough to drive three tanks around.
She is not going out today.
Have you seen the X-files?
You are never here :(
4.5 haswell in git version.
Might compile it from aur at some point.
Two hours when I compiled just the intel parts. Think on arch it compiles every graphics driver.
I am here.
My phone is in my bag.
What did you want?
Did anything go wrong.
Yeah, they will deny all responsibility.
It is them who decide to send all visas to some stupid centralised office.
They could very well process visa applications in embassy.
So it is their responsibility.
So it took 40 minutes?
Are you fine.
Is Noura back?
Is noura sabotaging your thursday by being off all week?
HI
Okay. I will head home in twenty minutes.
I am still at work.
I am leaving now.
Coming home.
We are going to Dreampark this thursday with my work people.
I am home.
I can play quite a bit today.
Are you fine? Did you like the music?
Fine. I just need my tea.
Hmmmm, I did not notice.
I have tea.
What are you doing.
SHOW ME ANYTHING
Hello Mariam.
You look different.
I think your clothes are different.
I am not sure.
You look nice. Not tired.
Today?
In fifteen minutes?
Is that the first, or second?
Do you not think the first was better?
I like that it was more original. The second time they spend too much time talking about what happened and what did not happen, and not saying what they wanted to happen.
Where did you go.
I have fool.
Will you be long?
Ready?
Just a wireless network called google.com
Rebooting.
voice...
Are you home yet.
Toka is still not home.
The fact that you think I might, means I probably will.
She is with friends.
Everyone is nice but I would not call them friends for a very long time.
I will if you are here at the weekend.
It is bed time now.
I got here and I could not open the door.
So I waited outside for 45 minutes because I forgot my phone.
Then I tried again and it can open.
Shitty visual design language on the door and handle.
They are three floors up.
And yes.
It is tomorrow.
LOVE YOU.
Do you know when you will leave?
Okay, I am leaving now.
I will arrive at the house first, because I do not have my phone.
If you are back by that time, just meet me outside the house when I am due to arrive.
Which will be 17:49.
Might play a bit today if you want.
Hi.
How evening?
I can only do evening today.
Tomorrow I can do early evening to night. The day after I can do all day I think.
I saw four half eaten dogs on the way home today.
But I also saw around 10 cubs.
cubs...? puppies.
Yako, worromot neht.
Not sure what this is, but I will check when I am home.
Mine compiled fine.
Interesting. I wonder what the toolkit is.
The thread suggests they do not know all the dependencies yet.
Well, clearly.
But having official packages is a good step.
The game is still java.
The launcher no longer.
Good. Just made the ultimate salad.
Watching a the invention of lying with toka now.
It was okay. It had an inverted roller coaster with four inversions.
Me and toka went to a theme park today.
With my work people.
Today was longer than expected.
Tomorrow I should be ready when you wake up or are ready.
Nah, I just had low expectations. 
The bumper cars were a lot of fun with the ten of us though.
Hi.
I am home.
Dreampark.
My face and head are very very sore.
Yeah, whenever you want today.
Found a repo with mesa git builds.
OpenGL core profile version string: 4.5 (Core Profile) Mesa 17.1.0-devel (git-de0b0a3a9c) Yeah booooooooooooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.
Just tell me when to restart.
It was not too bad.
Some things were fun.
It was not too busy.
My hands are ice.
I can not imagine how hot it gets.
Nope.
Should I restart?
Do you parents not complain?
I just played a game for 12 hours.
HI
DID YOU HAVE TEA
Yeah, it is toka's pin number haha.
WHICH SALMA?
Are you fine what are you doing?
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING FOR DINNER? IS SALMA EATING DINNER WITH US?
Okay, I will tell you when I leave. Is 45 minutes enough notice?
Roughly 34 minutes until I leave.
Okay lost track of time then.
Leaving in five minutes.
Hi.
twitter
pintrest
Are you fine?
When is it?
Am I talking to your aunt?
Is she watching our chat?
I started work with a girl called Soha.
She is not confident at all listening or speaking English.
But she can write and read it fine.
We sit facing each other.
But we talk by typing.
It is weird that she is right there but we never look at each other.
Start studying computer science :D
What are you doing?
What is SAHLAB?
Oh, toka got some tonight.
I have never had it.
Do you have it with ewwilk though?
Okay it is bed time.
Goodnight Mariak.
Morrrning.
Stuck in a bug.
What.
Oh.
I forgot my phone :(
Hi.
Are you fine?
I am sick too.
The cold or something.
Me too.
I showered.
It was not quick. I spend ages in the shower.
A shower should not be longer than 8-10 minutes.
I think my mum would have killed me if I stayed in that long.
That was the best song.
Disgusting practice though.
Morrrning.
Why?
I watched a lot of dark souls and I really want to play it.
Heading home in 15 minutes. I have the phone though.
A day of world conquering I think.
What is that?
I want to play that diving game.
And Inside.
Abzu.
When with gtk4 come out.
When will x12 come out.
When will linux 5 come out.
Hello MARIAM.
Well, you better sleep then.
You can study in the morning.
Did you finish yet?
Moorring. Tomorrow is offffffffff.
Work is great.
Hmmm, I think not.
Peanut butter really was the highlight.
Leaving in ten minutes.
YOU BETTER BE LEAVING.
I might be free this evening.
And I will be free tomorrow morning to afternoon.
Oh wow, no 32bit games any more? No android-studio?
32bit emulation has to be enabled in the kernel.
I assume the kernel will still have 32bit enabled then.
Hi Mariam.
I have today off.
No, tomorrow.
It is a national holiday.
More than it cost in the first place?
I did pass the mot.

Lets destory the uk.
Good morning.
There was nothing in this code that was copyrighted.
YouHub.com
What the fuck.
It infringes Nintendo's copyright, because the application circumvents Nintendo's technological protection measures.
I do not violate copyright of a bicycle lock if I cut the lock.
Nintendo believes the freeShop application circumvents Nintendo's protection measures by decrypting the game files accessible from its eShop servers, allowing freeShop users to access and play Nintendo's eShop games for free.
The freeShop application also contains unauthorized copies of the Nintendo 3DS Logo Data file, covered by U.S. Copyright Reg. No. PA0001781880, which further infringes Nintendo's rights.
Pretty sure it does not contain their logo.
I wish mine was :(
In addition, the files located at the links below violate the GitHub Terms of Service by facilitating the theft of Nintendo's games from its eShop servers, and the use of these files with a Nintendo 3DS device violates the user's obligations under Nintendo's end-user license agreemen
Github have nothing to do with Nintendo's end-user license agreement. 
And GitHub's terms of service do not include, "facilitating the theft of Nintendo's games from its eshop servers."
You update freeshop and the 2.1.4 changelog, "FUCK NINTENDO EDITION".
MORNING
Neeeeed teeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
The kind of tea with more than 10 as.
Only one blanket fits in the washing machine.
And it only just fits.
I keep sneezing and it hurts.
What do you like?
Oh did you see all the options for the launcher?
When you long click the home screen, then scroll up I think.
Or maybe settings, then scroll up.
What do you not like?
If you press the overview button twice in a row it acts like alt - tab.
The battery ui is much better now.
And you can reply to messages in the notification drawer directly.
There is a data saver quick setting that does not let background apps use data.
Did you find the launcher settings?
Are we getting 100 sugar rolls.
I think nationalist spain won in our game so quickly first because there is a setting to make countries follow real history more.
Having kosharrrry.
But what I really really want is a zigga zig sugar roll.
I think she has plenty of assets in the house now.
.6>zoX.+2t.`fC&(DGP%m"Lu-
Wait.
150 a month for a car?
By the time you have finished paying that off, it would be a broken worthless car.
That is a four year commitment with no exit.
For a used car that is already 4 years old.
I would rather buy a go anywhere yearly bus/train ticket.
Four years and 15 thousand miles is not new.
I do not care what they are charging.
I can charge 5000000 for a pencil.
If you are going to pay monthly, why not do what mummy does?
She never owns it, but she never has to pay when it breaks, right?
And I assume they replace the car eventually.
She is actually buying it?
I thought she was renting.
You say that, but you need to sit down and calculate the costs.
This "new" car will also have costs.
But with an extra 3000 a year.
When the cost of keeping an old car exceeds the cost of getting and keeping a new car, that is when you switch.
And it is up to you to do that calculation.
Are you paying 3000 a year in repairs?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> move to a city and use public transport.
Surrrreeee.
Private cars are just too expensive.
They are an insane proportion of people's income.
Get Jamie to buy you a car for your birthday next month.
Once you are through, you will have an income.
Get a motor bike.
Get a three wheeler motor bike.
Start repairing motor bikes as a hobbie.
Get a go cart.
A road legal go cart.
Nah, they are not safe.
How is daddy?
Collin Innes?
I always told you daddy would have heart problems.
His diet is too bad.
You mean his credit rating is dead and will never get a loan?
Fuck credit in the first place.
For rent, private landlords do not do credit checks on you.
He got into debt doing lots of things.
I never had a problem finding them.
Does he want to retire in Egypt?
He can become granny.
That is not how retirement works.
You can retire at any age.
You will not get retirement payments until the age specified in your retirement plan.
Mummy could sell her house and retire here already.
She could buy a flat here and only be paying 15gbp a month on water, electric, gas, and internet.
Phone line costs 2.5gbp every three months.
A large pizza at a restaurant costs 3gbp.
A bus ticket costs 10p.
The tram ticket is 5p.
The metro ticket 5p.
Shoes cost 5-10gbp.
Our rent is 70gbp a month.
Our combined income is 300gbp a month.
The exchange rate halved a few months ago so a few months ago all those values were twice as much.
It is 1gbp to 24egp now.
Are you finished yet.
WHAT WILL YOU DO
GO OUT WHERE
Come back mariam.
I am roasting brocolli.
Are you awake.
I am sleeping way too much.
fremJ9[vd*/d_p|VBAW5CGlJ
Very rarely.

What time did you get free?
Forget that call.
If you got a phone call a few minutes ago, forget about it.
Hi.
Great for tab whores.
Marmriamrm.

Tell me everything you have done so far.


I have lots if you come here.

No we have no milk.

What is wrong with you.
It was toka's parents' day.

So not much.

test
Toka just said the hot chocolate I made, "tastes like dirty water."
I am here and remembered the password and imported the key and everything works perfectly.
Did you get the keyboard working?
Get upppppppppp.
Yeah, it worked when I came to work, but could not get it working before I left.
Not sure.
Select it, then middle click to paste.
Not sure why the keyboard does not work there, try restarting maybe?
Okay, I am having a short break.
Did you get the keyboard?
Are you not going to the gym?
I wonder if the performance is any better.
I forgot my phone today :(
Five minutesish.
Okay five minutes now.
Or two.
COMING PLEASE HAVE FOOD
:(
Hello.
Are you fine.
I ran home.
Your sister?
Is it because the tap is squint?
Toka thinks I say Hla wrong.
To me it is hhhhhhhhhhla.
And army bath kid.
But hazem.
Did you show him to me yet?
Pfffft, I did kickboxing.
Wow. I did it for five years or something.
I stopped when I went to university.
I want to know.
Make it soon.
Are you going to meet me in korba this thursday?
Jesus christ.
How does it not go mouldy?
Falafel is not beans, though.
Fava beans are.
Oh you mean make the falafel, and order the beans.
Leaving in around 10 minutes.
Unless you want to meet me for a little bit around work.
You should make a calendar today.
Oh wow why were you happy you have exams.
Why are you happy going out.
Oh no, people could probably tell at that point.
Maybe, if you want to learn some flutter together and want to travel to my house.
These are all very new projects.
You can leave anytime after now.
Okay.
Kareem is here.
I think I got used to them.
Maybe I look like jessie pinkman.
You have not sent me any in forever.
No.
What game.
No. Look away.
Football supports ruin my ears and life.
Fiiiiiiiiiiine.
HUNGRYYYYYYYYYYYY
COMING HOME
Did you leave.
What.
I am. I had no break today, and accidentally worked an extra 15 minutes.
I have an idea for an app.
Hello.
Are you fine.
I am but I am really cold.
I am wearing a hand and gloves inside.
I am defrosting the fool.
Ahmed and Mostafa invite me to breakfast everyday at work and I have fool with them.
They are.
Programming, programming, eating, running, programming, sleeping.
You?
I had a hot aniseed drink today.
It was good.
I will put a second jumper on top of my onesie.
WHAT IS SHE DOING
I am waiting for some android stuff to download.
And drinking hot water.
What are you doing?
Tell me if anything is fixed :D
Hi.
In recovery, click install, then navigate to your download folder, and select the lastest download of the os.
Or wait until you get home to install it.
You can exit recovery and boot the old one.
Are you sure it is the newest?
It auto restarts?
Flash it again if it does.
Or never loads.
Leaving now.
I looked, did not conclude though.
Currently the bt you buy is the same package as the origin max.
But, the max the line can handle is closer to origin fibre.
However, if you want the internet under half the price and do not mind halving the speed, origin broadband is good.
At first glance origin broadband is 18GBP an month for 17/2Mbps, and origin fibre will be around 48GBP a month for 38/10Mbps.
No, but what will make your access much faster is getting the telephone cable to the middle floor.
The main reason the internet is slow in the house is because of the wireless coverage.
Me and toka use 2/0.5Mbps and we stream youtube videos fine.
So 17/2 is much much faster.
Currently you get about 45/6.
But only in the kitchen and living room, connected to Internet.
They do provide you with a router for free.
You can also pay for 12 months at once, and get around 22% off.
The website has a live chat feature if you want to ask questions.
They offer a static IP for 1.49GB a month. Cheaper than BT which is 5 or 6.
They will. But we will take a photo of everything before changing the router.
>Q+'JZl&97/kFqeO
What...?
You have the infinite max.
Which is the exact same plan as their max plan.
Just talk to them clarifying how much you will really pay etc.
And how long it would take to switch.
Ask about adding a static ip to the order.
Ask if you will still get any bills from bt.
Should do.
paul.t.meredith@btconnect.com
I researched it and based my choice on customer satisfaction. 
Line rental costs 18GBP a month.
So nothing is 10GBP a month that includes line rental.
It is 19GBP a month, with this clause, "Sky network areas only. New Sky Broadband, Talk and line rental customers joining without Sky TV only. 12 months minimum contract. Separate contracts for Broadband & Talk. Prices may go up during your contract. See below for further terms."
And then it goes up to 29GBP a month. And the router costs 10GBP.
I see no reason when it is slightly more expensive, and has lower customer satisfaction.
Just saw a post about people turning their bottom row keys upside down.
Tried it and my mind was blown.
The thread has 7000 score on the mechanical keyboards subreddit.
Took me a whole one minute to adjust and it feels so comfy now.
I hate football.
Oh wow.
I woke up.
Baaaaaaaaaaby.
Thank jesus.
I am super super clean.
Okay, do not buy anything too embarasing. 
Did you have the sugar bun.
Did you leave.
You guys travelled together?
Or did you just go with them?
So your parents went too.
Is it cold?
And I think you can not install to external.
I did it before with windows to go windows 7.
I had to uninstall windows.
No space.
Yeah.
I only have an external hdd.
But you need to have a windows install in the first place.
We need to get it working on linux.
I was playing a single player game as the USA, took the whole america.
Learnt a lot about combat.
If you have naval supremacy around your island, you are undefeatable. 
Also, support regiments such as military police, essential. 
For long wars, captured area will rebel and start destroying factories.
It gets out of control unless you make an army that's job is to supress people.
Which is the garison order.
I think mostly because short wars. Once we started a war that would never end, any captured territory will need managed.
*start
Feature: Co-Op Support, Cracked Online Multiplayer
I assume for windows only.
Any new multiplayer games around?
Boardgame simulator.
There was a game about a submarine.
Not on gg.
Remember that adventure minecraft map we tried playing but my internet was balls?
Is that loot grind game out of the question?
The one like diablo. 
Damn it.
Like diablo, free on steam.
Going to play moirai to see why it is so highly rated.
Was just about to send it.
Yes.
Next you are going to be telling me that fifa 19 is the best game.
Well yeah.
I mean the EU is not exactly left wing.
What is that?
This upside down bottom row is a **god send.
**not actually a god send
Is it fun?
Twice when I was young. But not that young, 14 and 16 or something.
Who do you miss?
I am.
But toka is at a wedding thing.
Oh. Hello.
Leaving in five minutes.
IS THERE FOOD.
Where are you going.
The power went out and it was boring.
Here is the most beautiful music you have heard all month.
When? I am home a lot.
No.
It is windows, ps4, xbox one, and ios...
It looks too cold.
Mororrrrrrrrrrrrrining.
Baaaaaaaaby.
Coming hoooooooooome.
You better have credit.
I am home.
Why had you not left at 6...............
Are you home yet.
I got paid today and we bought all the food :D
Here, yes.
You said you reverted that new contract you signed.
Is that not true?
Okay well at least they have documentation of you canceling it.
Welcome home.
Me too but I do not want to waste free time.
What was the best thing you did?
It looks like you were standing on a rock and looking at the rock and bed.
I will have orange juice.
I am here.
Are you.
Mariam.
Why when are you leaving.
So you have 1.5 times that much this month.
Who are doing what for half the price?
Chatted with whom?
Pfft, if BT managed to keep you, they managed to trick you.
I am.
I will be leaving at around 32 past.
Are you fine.
<3
I have chocolate corn flakes.
You better not add milk.
I just got home.
So exhausted.
But it is my weekend.
And I have tea now.
So good.
Did you fly...?
Was it the first time?
Next time will be a thunderstorm at night.
No it is safe.
What.
I do.
But why do you know.
I have no idea what vincent van gogh looks like.
I will go to bed now though.
(Also I bought coffee)
And two new trouser.
s
Plain finely ground coffee.
For my mocha pot.
I woke up.
835 each.
You paid rent already, sooo.
You have -50 to pay into it.
And I have 418.
Wake up and be off with me.
Baaaaaaaby.
Are you fed and drunk and fine.
I had coffee and cereal and now programming and listening to music :D
Hmmmmmmmmm I will defrost the fool.
Mmmmm foooooooooooool.
Are you going to alexandria this time?
Shortly tomorrow in the evening.
No emoji support.
Hi.
I am fine.
Yes but not horrible ones.
Have you tried talking to me instead of dreaming?
You do not imagine me enough.
I had fool. But I am hungry again.
What do you suggest?
More specific.
Roast brocolli?
Okay but either tell me when you are coming home.
I am not leaving you cold food.
I will have cornflakes until you are coming home.
I got two new trousers yesterday.
Should last me to at least 2025.
Coming in.
I am listining now.
Icelandic music is always good.
They are the monarchs of post rock.
Well, preferable to Egypt.
Civ VI for linux today.
I doubt it runs well but I am curious.
Hi.
Are you fine.
Why are you shaky and amm?
Stop having bad dreams.
I am programming but I will visit toka's parents for a little bit later.
What is mansoura.
Womansoura.
It is good morning.
Hot chocolate is buying coco powder and adding sugar.
If there is anything else in it, it is wrong.
And if it is just coco powder and sugar, it is cheaper to just buy sugar and coco powder.
Mariam.
I never went.
Toka is out doing something.
I really want juice.
Have I missed any big changes?
Did I miss any big changes?
Baaaaby.
ME.
WHO IS EMOTIONAL
I am leaving in five minutes.
Baaaaaaaby.
I AM COMING HOME IN FIVE MINUTES.
Baaaby.
Tookabababyb.
How big is it?
Morining.
Leaving in ten minutes.
Are you getting ORANGE JUICE AND SOMETHING ELSE VERY TASTY AND FOODY?
I type very short while at work.
I am going home now though.
So good morning.
I am very busy and concentrated.
Nope.
I am usually asked a lot of questions.
Mesa 17.0 is out :D
Yeah but I help people a lot.
If you feel better before going, you better not explode when you get there.
What does she do?
OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) Haswell Mobile
OpenGL core profile version string: 4.5 (Core Profile) Mesa 17.0.0
Yeahhhhhhhh boooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiii
Now I can play minecraft at 60fps.
Jesus christ.
Seems smaller than EUIV.
Saves.
Hi.
Probably best you reminded me.
I wonder if toka knows.
Oh wow.
Hello.
TEN MINUTES
Coming home now so I will be back in an hour.
Baaaaaaaby I am so hungry.
Leaving now.
It has been raining recently.
Hi.
I am fine but very cold.
<3
HELLO
I think I had a wet dream.........................
It had a fake flower hat.
With Nada.
One where you talk to me?
CAN YOU MAKE IT NOW
:(
I think it is not post rocky enough for post rock.
And I think the post rock elements take away from what this is.
I would not listen to it because if I wanted to listen to post rock I would listen to something that was more post rock.
It is not bad though.
I would not skip it.
It reminds me of the american dollar.
It is my weekend.
Eat noodles and program.
What will you do.
What will you paint?
Will you paint my mouth?
One day you will.
Maybe you will find out when you draw it.
Yeah I did.
Well, unless she wants a voice call for her birthday.
It is my weekend.
Good morning.
Baaby.
My weekend it thursday and friday.
Did you finish the walking dead?
Who shavvved?
I really need to play a game.
Why oh why is enter the gungeon not internet multiplayer.
Divinity original sin at 89%
If you want to start that today, I can finish it in an hour.
Sweet.
Just to confirm, v2.5.0.12, right?
You do not have it already?
Yeah mine is gog 2.5.0.12
I started downloading it ages ago.
Yeah.
I vote so.
Yeah, it is 2.0.119.430
Oh shit.
Fucking ball.s
Okay so probably not today, but 2.2.0.4, right?
Got any smaller suggestions for today?
Steredenn looks okay.
I mean, I am down for a shooter game we can play together.
Been a long time.
How is 7daystodie these days?
Any notable changes?
I remember last time I played I had stupid input lag that made it impossible.
Not sure if that was linux or windows though.
No linux upload on gg?
Only 10usd on steam.
Insurgency.
All the steam reviews are complaining about an update last week.
An anti-cheat patch with BattleEye.
People complaining it is a rootkit/spyware.
Yeah, if you can update and it does not install it, I might buy it.
Also 10GB?
Hard Drive: 10 GB HD space on a SSD
Wow some fucking people.
Very unlikely it has root access.
Star ruler 2 looks pretty good.
Not sure of ratings.
For long? Was it good?
Looks crazy deep.
It is multiplayer. And looks less demanding than stelaris.
Real time scares me.
Want to team up and dominate?
Games above 8 players or in galaxies of several hundred systems may exceed the capacity of a typical home connection. Consider playing very large games on LAN.
This part also scares me.
Nah, I want a game like that dungeon crawler we played.
Hmmm, might have been.
The one with floors.
And we 100%ed it.
Yeah.
Double checking enter the gungeon.
Nah, shared/split screen.
Did we not play a lot of it?
I remember it was hard and had crafting.
450mb, multiplayer, 88meta.
Let's go.
Shit what is this.
Says co-op and local co-op.
Are you sure?
Going to get it anyway since it looks fun.
39m
Stop playing without me.
hahahaha
This is online multiplayer.
Humble is drm free.
Do not have it downloaded, or have the wii set up.
Also when I played it at my house in scotland, the lag made online bad.
Also, this is a ball game.
I think at 100MiB we should give it a shot after we get bored with ultimate chiken horse.
There was a fighting game, doa I think, that had a ball mode.
Yeah.
ben
For what?
ben was a type
o
Also the ball mode was not that fun.
Was it not ps1?
local co-op only.
Worth getting?
I think so.
Want me to requeue the downloads?
The movement looks bad.
I never see the character moving while shooting or jumping.
It always stops to jump.
22m
I prefer tar.gzs
Takes less time.
Oh that is useful.
Wow the mecenary kings torrent is not archived.
Checked if it needs ports?
googled it?
Did you install the dlc?
Try the humble version?
Try using mesa?
Shit, is just got windy as fuck.
BEN WHAT THE FUCJ HAILSTONE@
NOT SHITTING YOU
EVERYONE IS FREAKING OUT
I recorded it.
It just hailstoned here.
Thunder now.
Hello?
Refresh your browser?
I will restart firefox
exec startlxde
Hello?
Restart riot and try again?
Success?
Which version is it, cause gg.
You call?
Wait, what was that website?
Think I gound it
Nope.
Any idea?
Try sending and I will be back in a bit.
Might have a bit of time before she is home.
Did you upload?
Hmm.
Downloading.
You are uploading?
Not sure what is going on.
Wait.
I have gog_divinity_original_sin_enchanced_edition_2.0.0.1.sh
Is this legit?
Installing it.
Worth getting the update files, right?
No, it all melted.
But it was crazy.
Hmmmm, the latest one?
Nope, need to download it.
Wondering if 119.430 will upgrade 2.0.0.1 to 2.1.2.4
Still not 2.2.0.4
Right, making dinner.
Good, I think I am getting a pay rise this month.
Turns out every one sucks at programming.
Magdsoft
The boss is Magdy. He is nice.
The boss is Magdy, he is nice.
They make software.
Go to team or something.
My internet is verrrry slow.
You can see me here.
The bottom of the page has a group photo of the first day I worked there.
Go to the english version.
Everyone is great there.
They all see me as some programming guru.
At the top bar there is EN.
The site is in php, it sucks.
They do php web development, ios development, and android.
Php is a shitfest though.
WITH WHAT
Wake up.
Well, I am ready, so call whenever you are.
HELLO
Did you see the hailstone today?
11ish.
How did you miss it.
It was crazy.
How often does it hail in cairo?
I am very very cold.
But good.
A tree?
It is good, very messy.
I like your patterns more though.
Do you like painting more?
I guess just more painting.
This will make you better.
I am wearing two jumpers, a t-shirt, long under trousers, gloves, thick socks and my onesie.
Just used 7za d (thinking decompress), it deletes.
Why the fuck does 7z have a delete command.
That is what rm is for.
Being cold a lot does not make it more bareable.
We are going to get faster internet on the 26th.
Maybe 8x faster.
Paying 120 more.
140 now, and 260 next month.
We pay 140 for 150GiB at 2Mib/s, and then unlimited at 0.5Mib/s, currently.
Yes.
We will move to 260 for 200GiB at 16Mib/s, then unlimited at 2Mib/s.
Watching episode 9 now.
Man, this is tense.
No. that ending is evil.
The situation with the servers makes it non trivial to restore backups.
Hi mariam.
I am going to work now :/
Emmmmm
Oh, they went looking for the boat and got surrounded by a group of fighters.
A large group, and rick just smiled as if he found his army.
A very powerful tool though.
I am fine.
Are you awake.
magdsoft server's were actually hacked.
And I am the guy to call aparrently.
Nothing, but I am saving for something that I will not say because secret.
We got two kittens today.
From her parents' neighbour.
Maybe soon.
Maybe 30m I will leave assuming everything goes okay.
Are you waiting for me?
Will you have noodles ready for me?
Fixing.
They were legit hacked.
Ameny is getting dropped off home now.
:(
Not right now, but who knows... :D
When I got here he had a find command typed in.
I looked at it and thought, wow, magdy knows how to use find.
So I asked him, but nope, google.
Yet to meet a real human who knows how to use find.
No but not many people learn.
So I wrote a script to do everything.
It had some problems to start because we are working with not a lot of free space.
But it should be free sailing from here on out.
I looked up the group and they have existed since 2006. Just their hobby I guess.
Magdy changed all the passwords already and revoked access.
I think he might be a little impressed with my script writing skills :D
Fixing.
Maybe I will finish soon.
They have an electric heater and I am jealous.
Looks like the same one I had in scotland.
Not really.
But there is no way I am getting up at 8 to go to work.
Yeah it really was.
Currently just me as magdy is dropping of ameny.
Well, it finished fine, but there is an issue.
So I am waiting for him.
Do you think it is reasonable for me to ask for tomorrow off?
No way I am coming in at the normal time though.
Okay he is back.
Okay should be coming home in 5-10 minutes.
Hmmmm you can use the keyboard?
No wait,
open the bar with alt b
then middle click the window title in the bar when the window is focused.
I restored backups with a script.
Coming home in ten minutes.
COMING HOME
Yeah, I use pass.
I use it with passmenu.
And I use a gpg key for signing, and identity (ssh).
Passmenu is just demenu for your passwords.
It is a part of pass these days.
Make sure not to use rsa for your gpg key though.
Advanced, then the correct curve.
Ed25519
Yeah.
The uid for the key or subkey.
gpg --list-keys
The big long random hex string.
I think you can use Paul Meredith <paul@lost.host> too, and it figures out which key.
But safer to use the uid.
No, I went at 11:30ish.
Make it happen, Mariam.
I missed what was ridiculous. 
I have babaghanoug and pineapple juice.
gitlab - dish expansive climatic greedy demeaning fervor flavoring
Where are you now?
Yes but not really.
Tired I think.
Baaaby.
Where is everyone.
I did not.
Me too.
I AM COMING HOME.
Hi Mariam.
Are you fine.
Sorry for saying Hi.
You said we say Hi too much.
I am fine. I had noodles and pineapple juice.
What did she say?
Oh I think I will tonight.
But they have lines.
Lines are for writing.
Nothing.
Did you get the new car?
Hi.
What are you doing?
Sorry.
What was the notification daemon I recomended? 
That is the one, thanks.
Did you like the song.


Oh.
Hello.
Is she at work?
When is she back?
To wish her happy birthday.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LISA.


Your birthday is over a week away.


I thought your's was the first of march.

Hello.
Interesting, but my income is now 0gbp.
Hopefully it does not take 5 years to get a result.
I asked magdy if I could use one of the spare monitors as a second and now I have two monitors :D
I know I know. You were not home so I could not call.
I asked lisa where you where but she said she had not seen you in a few weeks.
I am ready.
Hi Mariam.
Oh, okay, I will call later today then.
Just leaving work for the weekend.

Gaming all day tomorrow?
I woke up.

Yeah, divinity.
Never played a mgs game.

Hello.

Oh it got a bit late.

Tomorrow though.


How is daddy doing? 
I am cold but I am good. Are you?
WHEN ARE YOU HOME
BABY
What do you mean?
All fed and coffeed and gaming with ben :D
Eww football.
The kittens are sleeping in an X shape on my lap.
One head over the other.
I mean obviously.
When do you want a whole day.
What are you doing today?
If you will be more than 50 minutes, I will watch an episode of X-files.
Pretty big red flag if you ask me.
We got two kittens.
They poop everywhere.
Westworld is worth watching.
Dumping and crying.
He liked the RAF.
I still have to watch last week's walking dead.
Finished the duties, we decided to just hire a cleaner.
Having dinner in tenish minutes.
20 minutes after that I should be good to play.
You can leave it if you want, we can play tomorrow.
What 6:30 today?
Wow I slept in.
Ready?
I will do btn
Router unplugged by accident. Cleaners are are the computer so give it ten minutes or so.
Are you in game?
Doing stuff?
I have control of your character
I am back but not available to fight or voice.
Town quests though.
Or inv management
Wait why?
Buy cloudflare: destroy p2p.
Jesus, I hate cloudflare.
Since you use pass now, shall we use random 24 length passwords?
pass generate name 24
Yeah.
I will do pass the popcorn
Google too?
Might as well.
Let me try.
Some really shitty sites allow a password then process it to a max length or some shit.
Only came across one site like that though, all my other passwords are of this style.
btn worked for me.
Pasting the right thing?
Want to send me the gg password?
Why the quotation marks?
You never sent me the gg password.
Yeah, let me try it.
Yeah, I want to try logging in with the new password.
Because btn is working for me and not you.
You said you already changed it.
Without the quotation marks, yes.
Let me copy what you pasted and try.
Does not work.
what the fuck
Holy shit, I just pasted the one I posted and it worked.
Copy and pasting the first one fails, the second one works.
They are the same string.
Let me hex it.
0000000 023142 074527 027050 023057 056552 036556 060573 0525320000020 025526 066466 057122 0000120000027
0000000 023142 074527 027050 023057 056552 036556 060573 0525320000020 025526 066466 057122 0000120000027
SAME THING
Okay, same test, again.
Copying the first string did not work.
Second one did not work.
I FUCKING KNOW
NO
there
_j_
italic j
Morning.
They all had bold and italic parsing by riot.
I think we should use the assumption that all times we use the other person's local time.
Unless explicitly told otherwise.
So we do not have to say "my time" and "your time".
I am okay.
Oh my god.
I slept 13.
Just some pasta.
We paid the guard's daugher and granddaughter to clean the house today.
And hiring a cleaner is the best thing.
Every thing was cleaned in two hours.
It was impressive.
They will come every two weeks.
It will be the same people for us. They live here.
Is it just a web wrapper?
It is just the webpage inside of a browser.
It is like installing a new browser that can only go to riot.
These web-apps are lazy and should not be supported.
Watching videos.
But going to get food.
Yes.
It is. Just the usual stuff.
What do you think about playing divinity for about two hours a day at 6pm?
5 is a bit early because I come home just before 4, wait for toka and cook dinner.
What is your avialable time range?
BABY
BE FINE
ELECTRICITY MAN
COMING HOME
I am home. Did you just wake up?
Whay were they fighting?
You should ask.
If it makes you feel bad you should have the right to know.
Make them say.
One of them has too much branding.
Are you hungry?
By itself?
Why why would you even tell me.
Judging by today, I guess it will just be weekends.
Took me longer than I expected to be free.
Are you fine?
I am fine.
No, I just went to do things.
I am never mad at you.
COMING HOME
I am home.
How is the Z man?
Have you tried sabotaging it?
Why do they bother.
pacaur -Qm is a handy thing to run now and then.
I am fine but very thirsty.
Are you?
Are you alive.
hello
hello
hello
Where are you
he
hellollo
How are you?
How are you trying?
I am rewriting my chat client in go.
The client daemon is in go.
It is such a joy to program with.
Do you still program?
Eww java.
Go
I used to like C, but now Go has taken over completely.
And posix shell is the only scripting language I like.
I have to go to bed :(
I finished writing it
To whom?
The go one is about 1000000000 faster.
And 654444 times safer.
This is what I use to send messages.
The only part I have not wrote is the server part :D
Baaaaby.
Mariam.
I will leave work in an hour or so.
I am fiiiiiiiiiine.
Can you not have horrible dreams?
COMING HOME
What did you dream of.
Otherwise it fades.
Nothing.
hi
What will you do tonight?
Do not dream badly.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh. I might suggest we make some.
Almost finished work, nothing new I guess.
It is getting nicer outside, yes.
Offline files, or a notebook.
The recommended method is a notebook beside your bed. Any you get into the practice of immediately writing as soon as you wake.
Eventually you learn not to forget dreams.
And becoming lucid is easier.
What you saying?
Thursdays and fridays.
Oh wow, new raspberry pi zero.
added wireless and bluetooth for 8gbp.
20-40mbps practical.
Well you can never trust someone else to keep your privacy.
Yep.
Are you home.
About to have stock cous cous.
Hmm, now that you mention it.
We bought oat biscuits.
Hmm, I think so.
Yes, they are.
They are not as good as hob nobs.
Just normal oat biscuits.
I have forgot it.
Will you send you.
Dream fine.
This is the best one so far.
It is really good.
I just fell asleep playing solitaire.
I should be able to play at 4pm today if you can.
For long?
Hello.
2+ hourse.
Babbbyb.
Are you super fine.
COMING HOME
Let me just wash my face and hands.
About what?
I am home and weekending.
What?
You did?
Holy shit, I told you before I left.
Did I suggest I was going to say something?
What was good about it?
That sounds disgusting.
And expensive.
I am not convinced.
I am looking forward to sleeping tonight.
Is it Z-man?
Your cousins.
I am eating a cinimminion stick.
How is the hazem?
OH SHIT
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU
Sneaky month ended early.
Happy birthday mummy.
You have no idea how long I spent choosing those.
You look the opposite of dying in the photo.
And you never sent it..............
I am awake.
Just making coffee.
Been soaking it since yesterday.
BAAABY.
HOW ARE YOU
I am huuungry.
Ben and gaming.
Waiting for fool to defrost.
Hmmmmmmmmm, I want misasiasa2(5
I think so.
The ginger one is playing with the ball, rolling it around the room.
How will you spend it?
Game then toka's parents'.
Tell me when you leave.
Oh my god are you feeling well?
Are you fine?
Okay, I am free anytime.
Not even tea?
I had coffee today.
I have tea during the week and coffee at the weekends.
Just downloading episode 10 now.
Yeah, but no time in the mornings here.
Wait ben, when I said I used pass, I think I lied.
Only advantage being it is compiled.
This woman keeps phoning me.
She just says, hello, yes? If you please, yes, hello.
Four times she phoned.
Is she disturbed?
Five.
I just told her that she seems to be insane. She said nothing for twenty seconds then hung up.
Hmmm, there seems to be a terminal mumble client now.
Not sure, but willing to try out.
Let me set up a server.
Seven times.
Balls, ports are not forwarded are they.
Is anyone home?
Want to open a port on the router for me?
This new router does not let me do it remotely.
You switched to a BT one, right?
Yeah, the BT one?
Yeah, it does not let me configure it remotely.
Yeah, but I need a new port.
POOP FASTER
Coffee is meant to give you runny poo.
I think there is a fault somewhere, but I got it working by using go get -u layeh.com/gopus first, then go get -u github.com/layeh/barnard/cmd/barnard
On your laptop?
Just waiting for riot to load.
Open 192.168.1.1
Facebook?
Call toka.
I have no idea how to work facebook.
go get -u layeh.com/barnard/cmd/barnard
Who knows, the guy is not shipping correctly.
Ready for chat?
barnard -s lost.host:64738 -username ben
F1 to transmit
Hello?
I am. I am home now.
Barely any games for it though. The zelda game has insanely good reviews.
Do you have one yet?
I am pretty good at waiting, I think.
I would rather wait until I get the switch.
Which will be over a year away.
Loading screens might be an issue too though.
Skyrim was a joke.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
I will get you a link hold on.
Actually, when I get home.
We will go back to the motorola rom, right?
Okay coming home.
Did I forget my phone.
I did.
IS THE HOUSE SUPER CLEAN
IS IT SMELLING OF THE MOST DELIOUCOUSOSA FOOD
SHOULD I RUN 
IS IT URGENT
I had three windows.
Are you home yet?
All three were inclined.
I know which one you mean though.
Dawg.
I be playin' if you willin'.
Is it on linux?
Moorrring.
Guess who got a pay rise.........
Me, from 3000 to 3500, and then another rise in three months.
A month, in EGP.
But the exchange rate for EGP is wild.
It is currently growing in value fast.
From 1gbp to 22egp, to 1gbp to 16gbp in a month last I checked.
Not back down to the 1 to 10.6 it was, but still, going in the right direction.
Sorry, 22 to 19.
1egp to 16 usd.
No, 184gbp a month.
But life is cheaper too.
Our rent is 68gbp a month.
Jesus christ nintendo. These are normal? 
Dead pixels.
Do they not fucking turn on the lcds and test them before leaving the assembly line?
ben
I guess they bought the cheapest screens from the cheapest factory, and paid the workers the cheapest wage.
How the fuck can any worker or manager or qc pass a dead pixel.
Give me a message if you can at any time. Not sure how long toka will be.
5:30 that guy made me die.
BoTW runs at 30fps?
Since when was less than 60 ever an option?
If your game can not run at 60fps, start again.
Thursday.
Yeah, did you not watch the compilation of defects?
I accidentally deleted the last hour and half of code I wrote.
Maybe.
Maybe not right now though.
Dates?
Chocolate dates?
I saw that hot chocolate you told me about.
I already have a half kilogram of coco powder.
I can play today.
I have no idea.
We got married tonight.
HI MARIAM
Your dream.
got is past tense.
Now for 4+ hours.
Alexandria for work.
Nope, thursday I think.
HOW ARE YOU
I AM GOOD
HOW IS EVERYTHING?
Toka is away this weekend.
For four days.
Share it by email.
And then you would walk this.
What the fuck.
Natpunch server failed
Crash loading your game.
Thinking about using it as a vpn.
I need tea, and babaganough, and orange juice.
What will you cycle on?
At work now, but i might have seen it, what is it?
Okay, yeah, that does sound funny.
I have not had it in over a year.
Do I pay her?
You can make the egyptian K factory.
Probably. 
I just carried so much food home by myself.
I bought cherry tomatoes.
And strawberries.
Yeah, on the way back from work.
I am home but give me thirty minutes to clean and put the food away.
Wow I am late home.
Are you alive.?
IT IS MY WEEKEND
Bought a 2.5gbp a month vps just for fun.
It is pretty cool.
Specific ones?
Too late now.
But all day tomorrow.
Currongly studying.
I am now.
MOI
Any time now.
MOI
Making coffee.
Her friend wants to go out tonight but has to lie and say she is staying at toka's.
Are you alive.
I am back, one minute.
I am home now.
HI
Do you have a bike?
My computer fan started making a bad sound so I had to take it apart and clean it.
I am free the rest of the night.
Ah, yeah, it was a little funny.
Seen much better thomas the tank videos.
Like thomas the dank engine.
This was our cake decorating theme tune.
Google now has Google Allo, Duo, Chat, and Meet.
Along with the old gmail chat.
I set up a server in france and route all my internet traffic through it for some extra privacy.
Now when I go to google they think I am french and not arabic.
Ready whenever.
You call.
I will sleep now.
Are you using a vpn?
Why not?
UK.
I remember you looking for them.
Well, I am using one and I think that might be why the call is failing.
Let me stop it.
No idea.
Connection to game server failed.
Nah that was something else.
A quirk.
Hello mariam.
I am. Toka's friend is staying here tonight because parents.
One at a time?
Where did you meet hazem.
I have apple juice.
Mariam.
It is very quiet.
I FEEL FREE
Why is is so small and uncolourful.
Are you colouring it in?
Well, when me tea works.
I called the french server tofu.world
Tofu is a great food, and world is the earth.
You coloured it well.
I am trying to set up a new webmail thing.
Are you still cycling?
I should sleep very soon.
But fool first.
Hmmm, no.
Did you get a photo with hazem?
I am starting to think you two are not in the same universe.
Omneya text at 6:19 asking if I was awake. Then never she never replied.
Some cunt is blasting quran like they are exempt from all moral obligations.
I am going to work very soon, she will miss her chance.
Hello?
I can not wait longer, I will leave.
I am perfect, just leaving work and going to get food.
Which one?
In british tradition, the British University in Cairo, probably.
HI MARIAM I AM HOME HOW ARE YOU?
I AM FINE I JUST ATE 5 CININIMIMON SUGAR ROLLS IN A ROW
COLD 
I JUST DRANK ALL THE WATER
LET ME ONESIE
I BOUGHT TWO PACKS OF NOODLES AND NO ONE JUDGED ME BECAUSE THEY THINK I HAVE A WIFE HAHAHAHAHA
You never sent a photo of you two.
COME BACK
I think I am falling.


Did you swim?
Moooooooooorning.
Alexandria has 30 times fewer people...
Love you do not be sad.
Hi.
I flashed the latest stock rom to the galaxy s.
Android 2.3.6.
I wonder if I remember how bad it was.
You deleted snapchat.
Pretty sure. There is no password for it here.
I am fine. I should be asleep though.
I watched 3 episodes of the walking dead and now I am up to date.
Worrying because you want to sign into snapchat.
Yes, very windy.
to
What is ITA and ABT?
I want more sleep.
But do not want to miss free breakfast.
Poopy to both questions.
Why are you laughing at that?
I means the spotty mouth and tongue.
You said lol.
I think you are misusing it.
Why do you have spots?
It is worrying.
I AM HOME
AT LAST
NO MISPLACED POOS
HELLO
I wonder if you can make your own special k.
It looks like something I think you have showed me before.
I do not know. A bag or a drawing maybe.
Not that one.
But why denim why.
Immediately pisses in the kitchen though.
Are you still here.
Are you alive.
It is the worst material ever.
I am so tired.
Not sure if it has to be me who hands the form in.
I will make hot chocolate.
I have hot chocolate and a cininimonimon stick.
They are so tasty.
The spice shop.
Toka is away with the camera.
It looks like a block of gold.
You should have put it in the biggest box you had.
Then filled the box with stones.
I will sleep.
When are you home.
Voting by proxy you mean?
Referendum?
Mr May still rejecting the thought?
Are you home?
I have only 1 pound on me.
Yeah, I need to read up a bit about it.
Think we will need to send you the filled form.
ARE YOU HOME
I have no idea what it looked like without wrapping.
Could you send me a smaller photo?
Does she play the harmonica?
Or did she mention she wanted one?
Remember how happy my piano made me?
(my birthday is the 8th of december)
Playing games and programming.
Well, toka was away for four days so I was not cooking.
Do you not want me to be happy?
Just stuff from the bakery, some fruits, some fool and babaghanoug, apple juice.
Piano first, then lessons, maybe.
Are you awake yet.
Where to?
Is she taking me out too?
I think so, let me check.
No way I can take tomorrow off.
Can you not go later?
Where will you go?
Today?
I want anything you make.
But not okra.
Tomorrow is a deadline day.
Wait, it is today?
When are you leaving today?
Can you top up and phone me?
I am leaving.
My contacts are not imported so at least text me.
COMING HOME LOVE YOU
Good job.
How is yours?
I got home at 3.
Good morning.
Is it orange juice, hot chocolate, cinimonmomn, and bagabngibagniongihonguh time?
The kitten is falling asleep watching the monitor.
You call them the ocologist.
My computer fan is broken.
It is very loud. I am going to try to fix it.
But for now, I have told it to stay off.
It is running about 10C hotter at 52C.
I will just try not to use too much processor power.
Come in.
This reminds me of Nils Frahm, but different.
This will forever be my favourite channel.
ABCD?
FFFF?
FAB?
BAD?
I had one essay and I hated it.
I hate any course that requires writing.
Even physics had them.
Yeah, it is.
I think it would be better if you did it in your mid twenties. 
I think I would manage it much easier now.
Pfft, skip the ceremony, come stay in egypt for two months.
They will mail you the degree. 
Ben refused to go to his.
We can find you a bed or something.
Because it does not benefit him to do so.
Waste of time.
Just pay for the tickets and we will host you.
You can see how I live here.
Yeah, it will be balls hot.
But we are planning on buying two new fans and getting fly meshes for all the windows.
Last summer I refused to open any windows because when I did mosquitoes. 
But it was too hot to live.
No mosquitoes in the winter though.
Fans, fly meshes, and open windows will be good.
Nah, come after you finish university. 
Take a break.
You can get a tan by walking to the shop.
Where were you.
It is late.
Something like that.
I forgot the other name.
No way I could afford to visit though. Over three months of my discretionary income to get a single flight. 
I have plenty of money, as long as I buy egyptian stuff.
I can buy 250 bottles of tropicana a month :D
More specifically 250L.
Obviously not.
We get 6500egp a month currently.
And our rent is 1300egp.
Total bills are 1800egp.
Which includes the rent.
I told you our incomes relative to our outcome so you can compare.
The gbp to egp exchange is not very stable.
A few months ago, it was 650gbp, now it is 320gbp.
But we did not get twice as poor.
BABY
Did you phone them?
When is the latest we can arrive?
Well usually I am home at 6:15ish right?
So if we leave straight away we should be fine.
Did you ask about prices and the latest we can arrive?
Because I think you should.
COMING
Actually one second.
Mariam hi.
We went to the vet straight after work and then after that I fell asleep.
I slept 13 hours.
It was a tiring week.
One of them has worms.
The spice shop now sells dates.
A kilogramme for 14egp, which is a great price.
We have two kittens.
They are the dry but not sticky kind.
The best kind.
We took them ill.
WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM ABOUT
Your dreams are weird.
I need tea so much.
Are you writing your dreams down yet?
My fan broke.
I am running with passive cooling.
Try sending it as a file.
I think I send you every one of their uploads.
I just hear the first twenty seconds and then send it.
You can make a voice call with riot.
I can.
When your lecture is over I will try to answer your call.
If you will be able to call.
I do not know how to find it out.
I have no credit.
Wait.
It is the 16th.
I might.
Do you not want to use riot?
My pc microphone is 100x better.
It has lots of 0s or something.
Did you not get my call?
Do you have the latest riot version?
Try to call again.
I will shower.
The summer is not here yet.
Still jumper weather. 
Going to try and import an new fan.
A kilogramme of dates for 70p, pretty great, right?
Doing anything in bed is bad.
Are you making it?
Stick powder in the top of the machine, put water in, press go.
About one table spoon of coffee (heaped) per cup.
About to watch episode 13.
Pretty good ending, right?
Are you home?
Waiting for people to come home so we can eat.
Hi.
I am home now.
We went to buy some things.
Sounds like you need to rewatch it.
The man in black was the young guy.
Just in the future.
Too long ago for me to remember now.
Hello good morning how are you are you fine did you eat breakfast did you dream?
I finally got riot on my phone.
I will get data soon too.
I am at Toka's parents' house.
Nothing.
Toka's is cutting fruits. I am reading about chopping boards.
What are you doing?
Toka too.
I am waiting to go home now.
I think you do not have any study time.
Your entire year is just sitting exams.
In our third and fourth years we have around 10-12 exams during a six week period of the year.
In the first and second, 5-6 in a six week period, twice.
Compared to what?
Is it better now?
Because you talk to the person?
Are you taking anti-depressants?
You can give me some.
You can give me the spare ones.
Could you pinpoint the first corner on a map for me?
Yeah I did that route part.
Right, I am packing to go home.
Where are you?
I gave you the exact co-ordinate.
go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
.bash_profile 
garabt?
Yeah, he tried talking to me telling me to use it.
Yeah.
This means apt is already running.
make is the last step.
I am writing instructions to set up the build env.
gross is what you are paid, net is what you get after all deductions.
Hello Mariam.
BABY
Oh.
Terminal:
sudo systemctl stop openvpn-client@brenda
It is too late for a federation.
A federation would just be adding an english parliment.
Still with the massive population difference problem.
I am hungry.
Last time I could not play it it was too laggy.
More laggy than skyrim.
Why did you read it?
Was it rushed out?
Are you sure now?
I think I might still have them.
Yeah, tared them up.
I guess it was.
Good morning.
Magdy bought me a giant mug for my tea.
Why was curl involved?
I hope R does not install with a script downloaded with curl.
r is a package so I guess not.
The only thing I can thing of with restarting is a service was not started but was enabled.
But a language, nah.
COMING HOME GONNA PHONE MY BABY
Yes.
I am fine.
Are you fine.
Why would you remember it.
I am home.
I am sorry we have not met yet.
Well I liked the first 1:30 of that.
Nah, skip it.
Where do you want to?
I probably already sent these but I do not care.
Probably.
A toaster.
Babbyb.
Going home now.
I am home.
Me three.
And sunflower spread.
Bring crunchy nut, special k, and soy milk.
Iam.
Antie Lindale?
That is over a month pay for me :D
You have to stick it in your visiting fund.
Well, say I say thanks or something.
No need for food money. They have noodles for 12p.
Bring robinsons.
And some warburton's seeded.
Some crumpets.
Bring a load of biscuits too.
Just a whole suitcase of quality food.
Yes, hob nobs.
Nah lisa is going to bring all the essentials.
Mariam.
Some mushroom pate with the thick triangle oat cakes.
Some vegan cheese and ice cream.
Fake sasauge rolls.
FIND A WAY
SMUGGLE THEM IN YOUR BUTT
I am now.
A samsung 960 evo m2-2280 is the correct ssd to get?
The pros are 16 lanes I think.
I think I will only have 4.
Not sure, I have not kept up with this stuff.
Or should I wait out and see if optane is ready.
I assume 16GiB of ram should be enough this round.
I brought my headphones to work.
It is very very nice.
Well, no thumbnails.
Also, samba is a lot faster, but the pi is crippled on that anyway.
Think it only does it when you are running X.I run alpine on my pi so everything is in ram.
They answer that in the faq I think.
I just boot 18MiB or something from the pi to mm.
Alarm?
Oh.
I would use that if I needed a lot of shit on it.
mm
It is just a chat screen.
The program I mentioned.
nfs or samba not a lot better for a network fs?
I am running qbittorrent now but moving the transmission torrents is going to be a pain.
I will sleep early.
Hi.
BABY
Jesus what was wrong with people?
You were still at the place and they said "PERSON WHO LOST THEIR BAG COME GET IT"?
Will I wake up.
I slept too long and my face hurts.
:(
I woke up.
Hello morning.
Where did you go.
"Everything" for the ps4 looks pretty cool.
A game called Everything.
I am making coffee.
Are you subbed to that? Is it legit?
I only saw 40 minutes of it.
Not sure how low or how high you can go.
Oh wow.
I am making dinner.
I fried all the stuff in the kitchen.
A pan.
Oil.
Rice.
Onions.
Garlic.
An egg.
Soy sauce.
Are you overseering nada and HLA?
 One who keeps watch over and directs the work of others, especially labourers.
Says wordnik.
BUT NOT NICER THAN MINE RIGH RIGHT?
I saw this candle on toka's phone.
Now.
When will you.
When at all?
It is too hot.
I am playing solitaire.
Good morning.
Are you fine?
I am fine yes.
I am writing a generalised webservice in go.
Yeah, saw that.
Is it not made in JS or something?
Same issue exists with chrome aparrently. 
I just pimped out my vim setup.
Xamarin.
The cancer of the mobile world.
At least vscode is not too bad to use.
The rise of web apps that are "native" pisses me off though.
All these electron apps.
Lazy as fuck.
QT is cross platform.
Well, neither have I, but fuck it.
Some scummy trick to get people to make apps work on their os.
It does not mean anything.
Now and again I will change my username but I just randomly type letters until they look like a word I like.
How did you come up with Mariam?
Marmalade is better though.
I am still programming.
Yeah me and toka recorded a 15 minuteish video.
We tried uploading it today but it was killing the internet and taking 9 hours.
The second part uploaded.
We are uploading the other two parts tonight.
Toka sent a message saying happy birthday and that we are sending a video.
Youtube, but again, slow internet and finishing tonight.
Are you here.
How did you spend your night last night?
WHO IS THIS NEW PERSON
IS HE REALLY THAT AMAZEN?
Is this Aya?
I think it looks like her.
TRY
You can give it to me when we meet.
I think I have ate and drank too much.
Oh lots.
Fool, and black eye beans with peppers rice tomato sauce kosa, and orange juice, and hot chocolate.
One of the kittens does nothing but knead me.
Two months ago I think.
Not really, they just poo a lot.
Sabah el morrrning.
Hmmmm 4:40 I will leave.
HELLO.
Hi.
Of course it was me.
How could you suspect otherwise.
I am very very tired too.
And hungry.
What did you eat.
<3
Roselle what.
I know that in arabic but not english.
The question is always is x EGP a good price for y.
Also who knows.
It is five years old.
Maybe midrange five years ago.
There are new models of this series.
Interesting to note that Toshiba produce the sensor in that camera, not Nikon.
The 5200 was the model from 2012, 5300 was 2013, 5500 2015, and 5600 2016.
The 5000 series is the "Upper-entry" series
There is a table at the bottom of this page.
Baaaaaaaaby.Hi.
We are having beshamel.
Hey.
HELLO MARMALADE.
Where are you.
HI.
I am working.
You are learning about CPU architectures?
They are teaching you about logic units, registers, L1,2,3 caches, and pipelines?
I forgot my phone.
Dying of hunger.
What the fuck?
The 1GBP coin.
Jesus.
World's shortest deprecation period.
What is computer architeture?
As in x86,mips,arm,power etc?
Why would you translate it.
C does not translate to assembly very well.
C without any system calls or library calls is similar.
But even then, no arrays, no for loops, no while loops.
Are you sure this is assembly?
Assembly has labels and jump conditionals.
You can increment a register and jump if it satisfies a condition.
For loops are just an abstraction of a while loop, and while loops are an abstraction of labels and jumps.
And in assembly there are no abstractions.
I just checked mips just in case, but no for, whiles, or arrays.
But these are labels, increments and jumps.
Also mips is disgusting.
Can you read my collatz max path program now?
I heavily heavily optimized it.
Are you home yet.
Does she live near?
Comes out today I think.
I am awake now.
Yeah a million miles away I know.
Try unplugging it and back in.
It is getting way too hot here.
I am.
I may be late today.
Okay, leaving in five minutes.
Maybe, I will message when I get home.
Did you get 200 too?
I have one more day.
You do, right?
Nah, not much.
We bought mesh for the windows.
So we can open them without getting mosquitoes and flys.
There is no rush.
Or do sisters get a bigger bonus?
Who is lindale?
Since when is lindale a more popular word than linda?
Who is lindale?
Mariam.
Mariam.
I went to bed.
Very sleepy.
The bin man woke me up today because I did not hear the phone alarm.
Hello Mariam.
It is fine.
But it is my weekend.
I am a little bored.
Toka fell asleep.
I think I will have babagahanough.
What will you do?
Getting burny hot now.
32 tomorrow.
I woke up.
My alarm just went off at 10 past 10.
Wake up.
I have coffee.
Who cares about people who do not care about other people's feelings.
They need to take a moment to consider how other people feel.
Everything is always about them.
I did but not tea.
I had coffee.
The last of it.
I am not used to talking with text to you anymore.
As long as we do not talk about mohammed.
HEY
You know I still remember the time when I first suggested I knew what being together would entail.
And maybe the moment when you thought it would not happen, changed.
I was in the first biscuit factory bathroom.
It is cool in our house.
Are you inside?
That I would have to change religion.
But what religion people think I subscribe to means nothing to me.
It all means nothing to me.
I am bored without you.
You are here to make me happy and reduce suffering. I am here to make you happy and reduce suffering.
For example, by encouraging each other to eat noodles.
I brought the status bar back on the computer.
It looks like this now:
First is the average download and upload speed in the last 10s.
Second is the total download and upload since the computer started.
Third is the current hostname of the computer (tofu.world means I am using the VPN, something .tedata.net means not).
Forth is the time the computer has been on.
Fifth is the average core temeperature.
Sixth is the day number out of the total days in the month.
Do I need anything?
Hanging the washing out.
And cleaning the tub.
But it started yesterday.
Eating spinach.
In my pants.
I was planning on finishing it...
You said I could have half.
Someone is super cleeeannn.
I am a cheapskate.
I have already been to the tap today.
Quite a few times.
Okay.
When?
Now the moment of truth.
I took apart the fan and cleaned it.
YOu always do.
What will you do tonight?
I wrote some scripts, cleaned the washing machine and dishes, and watched some videos.
Oh and I took apart my computer fan and cleaned and oiled it.
Yeah that is how I found it.
The whole channel is a bit crazy.
We have not made taymeya in forever.
And I just did and it is perfect.
Watching the cleaners clean is better than cleaning.
I make the peices flat to increase the surface area, I cook them quite slowly so that the whole thing is cooked.
I hate that they make big balls, quickly fry the outside until it is brown and leave the middle raw.
The free oil.
It smells and tastes bad.
Maybe when I start pooping gold.
You are not that little.
If it is a stolen video...
But posting your children to satisfy some attention issues.
It is such a violation of privacy.
I actually thought about making you a video this morning.
They are so big and compressing them and recording is a lot of effort.
And I am lazy.
Toka went out with her friends.
I have no google account any more.
I can do it, but I am lazy.
Yes.
I have only seen a short video of you.
It was about four seconds.
I am home.
Yeah, he will stay until Toka I guess.
They always get too loud on me.
My throat hurts.
Nah.
I went to bed.
The main menu is around 10fpm for me.
I lubed up my fan today.
Hoping it works okay now.
Has been for about four hours.
Yeah no noise at 2000-3500.
Rpm
It would start making a noise then sharply fall in speed and continue to decrease.
It goes between 0 and 6100.
3000 is pretty much silent. 3500 at 100% CPU 28C ambient keeps it at 65C
4500 becomes a bit noisy for my liking.
4-5C more than this and I will start spraying myself with water.
This is the app I used.
Just find a voice recorder and share to riot.
Wake up.
I do not feel motivated to do anything.
I feel hungry.
Just checked tor and my connection speed is the limiting factor now.
Going to give it a try system wide.
I started turning the U to an O.
Someone finished it. And now they are merging the N I to M.
Did you do well?
Baaaby.
Did you restart the computer?
Did you get it working?
Are all the cables plugged in?
Is omneya there?
Did she bring the lighter?
Did the cleaners come?
I will leave in five minutes.
Anything.
And everything.
Coming now.
That game is looooooooong.
Would pc speedruns not be faster from loading screens?
Depends on the number of runners.
Why not super mario 64?
A year of 12 hours a day and I am sure you will get the record.
Going to help me vandalize the uk flag on r/place?
Someone got the same idea as me.
Going to change the T to an I.
Some cunts keep reversing my changes.
Thought about erasing the red and white to make the flag scottish but that would be impossible.
What was not?
I am home.
Did you make a video?
In riot?
It can have large files.
Want to start at the bottom left and fill it in black?
Mail?
Of the flag, not the text.
A private youtube video?
I replied on my phone but I think it never sent.
I had a dream that we visited today.
Daddy would not let us leave his company.
Are you still alive?
Hello.
Are you fine?
How will I see the video?
Latest attempt is to change UNITED KINGDOM to UNITFUCKINGDOM
Shit some people are trying to stick red on the scottish flag.
You have a lot of dreams about me coming home and not telling people.
No babies.
They are illegal.
It was nothing.
Regress those dreams.
I got the C in by myself.
Yeah, I think you guys are fantasizing too much.
Baaby.
Hi.
It is fine.
You can probably still apply.
He hires a lot of interns.
But you would have to do either java/swift/php.
They are the only languages we use.
Until I convert everyone to go.
The rest would not be programming though.
Yeah, probably by me haha.
What would you apply for?
I did know but have not got it yet.
Is it on btn?
Yeah, I always forget to start my client.
Web is php, mobile is swift/java.
Engineer is boring.
I am an android developer.
I am the android team leader.
I am the Shaba7.
They are all very nice.
I can handle everything.
I also complain about everything I think is wrong.
We have a bean bag at work.
But no one sits on it.
You are blocking your face.
Did it end with fuck?
I finished the fuck last night.
No one was editing it at night.
The irn bru, nessie, and thistle.
This is better.
I do not recognise hla.
Come in.
If you ended up working with me it would be the best.
Different every photo.
Is that a knife she is writing with?
I hope the point is always blunt and she is not allowed a sharpener.
Of course.
I am home.
Are you here.
Runner beans are 20p for a kilogramme. Pretty good right?
Jaq
That was a mistake.
Okay, I will check my account info tomorrow probably. 
Just variations of courgette and aubergine.
We were using brocolli a bit too.
Have to work with what is in season.
Tomatoes quadrupled in price this month.
You should buy a 182 pack and have one a day for the year.
I got a pay rise from 3500 to 4500.
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, for the next six months.
HELLO JUST NADA N A D A.
IDENTIFY YOURSELF
In Egypt?
What rank are you in the world?
There's a long way to go yet before you can achieve englightenment. 
I got a pay increase again.
To 4500 this time.
How was your day?
Pretty good.
What is wrong with yours?
Are they still your friend.
I am.
I will get into bed
.
Hello.
Mariam.
Hi.
Yeah.
Maybe.
It has a software flaw in it.
It disconnects all the time.
It is why I got the cable installed.
Nada.
Could you get your brother to report my phone number as stolen?
It got stolen.
On the street.
Vodafone will call him for authorization.
Toka says to tell him.
I am fine.
Just angry.
I got robbed.
They stole my phone from my pocket.
Now I will never go near anyone in public.
I want to forget it.
But I am fine.
Outside work.
Of course.
What.
For gnome and wayland?
Fan is good if you want to play.
Hi.
It is eat everything time.
What will you do today?
Will you send the video?
We have a bill jar that is full of money because the people always come when we are at work.
No one any more.
We are both at work.
Yeah, we pay that at the place below our flat.
I bought concentrated tamarind juice yesterday.
And orange juice.
Divinity, now?
Yeah.
Hello?
alt b
The side button closes things.
The not keyboard or menu one.
Are you here?
toktaktoktaktoka
Nada. Are you here?
Could you call toka and get her to call me?
Thanks.
Are you alive?
Hi.
Are you fine.
I am fine.
What will you eat now?
Yeah, it is fine.
The screen, menu, resolution, 1920x1080
menu -> DP1 -> 1920x1080
Yes, we do.
A little what?
Superstitious?
Mohammed is speaking to me about tea and flowers.
I am at work.
From 4pm.
I took a careem there and magdy gave me a lift home.
Awake?
Not sure how long I will have.
Without implying I will not have long.
Divinity?
Are you alive?
Hello Mariam.
I am fine.
Did you celebrate?
No.
Why are you better?
Even though I hear of your sadness, you are always a happy person in my head. Any time mariam is involed, it is a happy moment.
He spoke some english.
And was quiet.
I have had lots to eat.
Do you have a toaster?
The toaster is the most important thing in the kitchen in the uk.
Nope. Sliced bread here is awful and expensive and bland.
And there is no olive/sunflower/soya spread.
And peanut butter is expensive.
Have you noticed gold on gg?
Helllollol.
I am here.
Our cat prolapsed today.
What were they talking about?
Pretty sure she should be fired.
If it is out of character, she could stay.
But if she has had reports of this before, she should lose her job.
This is a death threat.
It should be reported to the university and the police.
And if it was in jest, she needs to make a strong case and learn a lesson.
You got your parents involved, right?
Complaining about a death threat takes precedence over a letter.
And when she tries to give you an F, complain again.
Make things work correctly.
Complain to a lot more people than that.
But the lecturer will deny it and you might have a hard time making people believe you.
It is not acceptable and you should not stop until justice comes.
To let actions like that slide.
Toka just asked when we are going to meet.
Are you free any thursday?
Every second friday too.
Hi.
I can play for 2-3 hours I think.
Well, if you are and an hour is not too short, give me a message when you are back.
Nah, it got put back in, stiched, but it came out again a bit this morning.
Probably should have mercy killed it.
I would expect to be euthanised if I prolapsed.
Come in.
Are you fine.
Say you are fine.
Be fine.
Never giving birth.
I am fine too.
Anal.
Yeah, which is why I recognised it immediately. 
<3
The cats are suprising very good at eating their own food.
I just got home.
I am eating one of everything.
Come back.
A plum, a sugar bun, a date biscuit, a golash.
This is my usual time if I do not get free breakfast.
Did you dream?
Did you write it down?
Why is it messy?
I want beshamel tonight.
Toka will be home later.
Will you send me the perfect song?
Also, only two small poos.
Tell me when you leave.
Also, do you want beshamel.
I think we over feed them.
I want beshamel.
If you tell me when you leave I can start making it and have it almost ready.
I already ate one of everything.
A plum, a sugar bun, a date thing, and three golashes.
I will make mango juice and tea.
I am fine, be fine.
......... SO DO YOU WANT BESHAMEL
I will make tea.
I like it crispy.
So we put the sauce on and put it in a tray and grill it for a while.
Until it is cripsy and brown.
Is she ready to pounce on her enemies?
She is looking older every photo.
Not yet.
I told her to give me a message before she leaves so I can start cooking.
Nope.
My sister loved these.
But I always hated the smell.
I used to get my parents to open the car windows when she had them.
Is this her pack lunch?
Yes.
Is there a difference between dry/active/etc?
28" or 32?
I think the photo is from the wrong perspective.
Not bad. Waiting for toka to come home to have beshamel.
White sauce pasta, but no milk or anything.
What is the washing powder and fabric softner you use?
Thought I would get some so the smell reminds me of home.
Well, we boil this powder in a pan and then grill the pasta until it is brown.
Should I wait some minutes before starting?
How long do you think you will be?
Be home soon, and be safe, and avoid everything.
Love you <3
Yeah I might, I have had bad experience with the yeast here though.
It never seems to work.
Had enough of pita, that is basically all they make here.
I need a nice seedy browny loaf.
I will need to deshell a load of sunflower/pumpkin seeds.
The cheeto one.
Same thing stopping you.
work, toka.
Why will you not go out somewhere with me?
Hi.
Hi.
I am not sleepy.
No long.
What will you do?
Okay.
I just got home.
There was no internet at work today.
Hi.
I am home.
There is no problem.
The driver renders fast.
Oh you mean ui wise.
Set a global variable for GTK 3, gtk2 is fucked, web browsers are fine with a launch option or preference.
St, use a bigger font.
dmenu, bigger font
Not much work really.
Mine is, but dwm launch options.
Same with st, actally.
They all take -fn for a font string.
You should upload your dwm config to a remote git.
You can set any commands to any key combo in dwm/config.h
Inconsolata is smaller than most so I think I used 18.
But I have used 1080p most of the time for a long time.
Not sure what I use now, noto sans mono or inconsolata.
The huge character set is too appealing.
Wait I will get my current font.
Dmenu I use 18 for 1080p, and 14 for st. Inconsolata.
I usually go 1.5x scale with 4k.
2x is too crippling, and 1x is too small.
But it depends on your screen size.
Yeah I tried playing the last one you said and it was boring.
Will have to look up crash.
I think the world will become more and more vegan. Once in-viro meat is cheaper than producing animals, there would be no reason for people not to be vegan.
Well, eggs and cheese.
And of course eventually it will be cheaper to just grow meat than growing an animal.
Monitors last forever and you always have a use for them.
I stick passmenu here too.
To alt + p.
Yeah.
1080p though.
24/6 would be good for 4k.
Make two shell scripts called ten and four.
xrandr --output DP1 --mode 3840x2160
Man, you must be pretty psyced if you are preparing.
I would have waiting for 120fps ips.
Not sure about QT. I assume so, it is usually pretty good.
The highdpi article is pretty good.
Not a bad price.
Oh wow.
Is this not a bit tiny?
I actually thing if I saw a 32" monitor now it would seem huge.
28.
28 is the biggest I have seen in forever.
Used*
Actually.
Is mine 24?
Yeah 24.
Okay so a 28 would seem huge.
Nah.
But I would never go smaller than 24.
Too small to not scale ui though.
Was Aya pretending to be me?
Then again, tvs also fail with the bios a lot.
Still to see a usb type c port.
I fucking hate how hard usb is to plug in.
And how shitty micro usb is.
BABY
WHERE ARE YOU.
I AM HOME LATE AND YOU ARE NOT HOME
I have never done it by accident either, but I do it all the time.
Fonts look fantastic.
MY STOMACH IS CHURNING OF HUNGER.
Not suprised it was elgin.
They take accidents pretty seriously.
And there are strict rules to cleaning.
Maybe, but I have had a lot of problems with seeing the bios over dp.
Not my current computer, but the server.
All machinery must be shut off and isolated, and locked before cleaning. 
There was one exception to this rule and I complained to the factory manager about it.
Oh it is good.
Some of the smaller flowers look like pawprints.
Not recently.But with the server.
Divinity tomorrow?
Which character?
The waka waka guy?
Been too long now to remember.
Hello.
Which days?
Okay we are meeting thursday.
Say yes.
:(
I am fine.
Are you?
I went to the bakery.
You need to make them linear though.
And increase the resolution.
Why are you not.
The one I sent.
Hi, happy break.
I would expect most things to run okay with your graphics card.
It is only 4x the resolution.
What is gouache?
And what happens on wednesday?
But they had no bread.
Yeah, I had no idea what that was.
WHY DO YOU NOT REALY WANT THE DAY WE MEET TO COME
Ready for divinity?
Okay, did not expect you to be ready.
I just woke up, I need to clean some stuff and make tea.
And have some breakfast.
I am ready.
Waiting for riot to load.
The second one is too slow and the voice is boring.
I am so hungry but there is nothing to eat :(
HOW ARE YOU
ARE YOU PERFECT
1
Mariam. Mariam.
Oh I did.
It was big.
It is not warm enough to happen in scotland a lot.
There was no bread at the bakery.
I like the next song better.
The first I think the voice is a bit annoying.
And the bass guitar is weird.
But not bad.
So I bought two fateers.
But I stay the same.
And hmmmmmmmmmm two special chicken noodles.
Should I have one or two?
Hmmm, maybe this evening I will find new music.
Just listen to everything on the ambient youtube channel.
It is all perfect.
TWO
I am playing a game with ben.
It is my game day.
And then soon I am going shopping with toka.
A big list.
Black pepper, washing powder, fabric softner, peppers, pasta, seeds, peanuts, bread, vinegar, mayonaies ewwww, desserts, a laundry basket, tea strainer.
What is your list?
Is there nothing else you want?
You can write my name and keep it for when we meet.
I have the letter I wrote to you here.
The real version.
I think so.
I can go get it.
Both.
My name painted at the top and yours at the end.
Both.
I looked for it but could not find.
I remember packing it.
Maybe I folded it somewhere.
Okay.
Why did you write these words?
How long do I have?
Typing...?
It is not bad.
A little down.
But dom robinson.
Oh a new novo amor song.
Not even going to test it.
The quality of it on soundcloud is awful.
Still not 100% rec2020
We got a lot.
Have you seen our kittens?
No idea how old they are.
4 months maybe.
Toka can send some photos.
Okay.
Wait, do you mean I should leave in forty?
Okay, see you at cinabonene.
I only have 700 left.
Leaving now.
I am leaving.
No idea why monopoly would be exiciting.
Payday 2 aparrently had a lot of problems on consoles.
Yeah, it is a joke.
We are home.
I am not sure. I will look.
I think the peanuts.
I will make peanut butter.
I got bread flour and seeds to make seeded bread too.
Yes, I used to make it when I came here.
But I missed the factory perfect stuff from the uk.
All you do with peanut butter is take all the red shell stuff off, stick them all in a blender and blend.
It becomes dry, then sticky.
And the best ever.
No other ingredients.
Nope.
When you buy them in the super market, they often contain oil, because it stops the oil naturally seperating and going to the top.
But it makes it taste worse.
Adding oil makes it not seperate while sitting on a shelf for a year.
Chickpeas, lemon, garlic, tahini, oil, salt.
It is not easy to make perfect.
Who are they?
HI.
How are you.
I am home.
I never saw you.
I got a little tea pot thing that goes in the tea cup.
Well I wanted a silicon strawberry type one.
But I only found a metal cage.
So not exactly cute.
Are yo ufine?
What am I looking at?
Oh god.
Hello.
What have you been doing with your break?
Well, you know where I am.
Well, you know where I am.
I am on my way home now.
Did you leave yet.
Are you going straight out?
Hello.
Hello Nada.
Do you have any INFO for me?
Hello Nada
All I see here is posts about them.
Seems risky, toka might notice.
She might be.
Probably. It depends on the condition of it.
And the price.
I still have zero idea of the cost.
Mariam, come in.
I will sleep.

Hello.
ARE YOU COOKING
I will leave in five minutes.
I am fine.
Are you fine?
Education in Norway and Findland is free for everyone.
Norway has just about 100% english speakers.
But it is expensive to live.
Oslo would be around 20-30,000 egp a year.
But that is nothing compared to the cost of education and living in a country 1/6th as good.
Also, Olso is the capital and the most expensive.
Finland would be cheaper, but also not as good, and Finish is much harder.
Norwegian is an easy language.
Good morning.
Are we meeting today?
Why the fuck did she do that?
Oh wow.
Give me a place.
Calling early elections to gain more seats...
Will they delay elections when they are unpopular?
Yes.
As if their gerrymandering was not enough.
They are such scum.
One moment.
Come back.
Correct.
Name a time.
Any day after 6pm.
Thursday all day.
Friday all day.
I am.
Yes.
How did we call last time?
I will call from toka's facebook account.
I will start cooking.
There is never a time I do not want to talk to you.
Just times I can't and times I run out of things to say.
Hi.
Are you fine?
Nope.
I woke up.
Talk to soha and tell her if mohammed mentions "deducting pay" one more time you will quit.
Complain to HR about the email he sent.
Do not entertain him.
He is out of order.
Threatening to deduct pay for tasks is wrong.
Will you start skipping days if you do not get breakfast bought for you?
Daily reports are never sent to him.
HR is the place for complaints.
It is HR's job to speak to him.
It is a manager's job to keep logs of tasks.
Employers do not punish employees, what is this?
They shout, then they fire.
Anything else would violate a contract.
Which would terminate the contract.
If these deductions are not in the contract.
He will be violating the contract by deducting.
Go to HR.
I have to leave.
Love you.
All the way from tahrir?
It will be cold.
No breakfast today :(
I think it is.
Good morning.
I like it.
Divinity in an hour?
Okay, I will have some fool when I get home.
Mariamrimarm
HI
HOW ARE YOU
ARE YOU FINE
Why are you not better than okay?
You can wish me a happy weekend now.
I hope you have the happiest day.
Do you meet any food today?
Will you have that chrispy bread?
At koshary places they sell this hard oily bread.
Where are you.
Oh I am not sure.
You can test me.
That sounds like bismi allehi
I never see things written.
I know oxem belleh
And yuhrub.
It is a beg to god for help.
WHY WOULD YOU NOT LEAVE THEM TO ME
STRANGERS THROW RUBBISH
I want the i hope you have a happy weekend one.
Or no.
I want you to choose.
You have to be selective here.
Come in.
Are you eating the koshary?
Oh hi.
I never got the notifications.
I can play for 3ish hours.
Do you mean now for an hour, or in an hour?
Go.
It is just playlisting now.
I want the video.
What will you see?
I neeeeeeeeeeeeeed teeeeeeeeeeea.
IT IS MY WEEKEND
I am playing with ben until toka gets home.
It is piano.
I can listen now.
It suits the game.
It is really good so far.
Hello home.
I am hungry.
I made a peanut butter sandwhich.
Are you peelsa?
Asleep uoy era?
Doog
Gnillaf am I.
Tihs ekil skool siht
Ni ro no?
Sey.
Marah eht edih, kciuq.
This is when we were painting.
I hate painting.
It is so boring.
Hello Nada.
Nope, this one is new.
I wonder what hla will look like when she is older.
I just got out of bed.
half an hour.
Okay.
This picture scares me.
Hello Nada.
Yes.
HEY GOOD MORNING
Hi.
Are you fine?
Hello?
Lost connection.
But i think we should break for today.
Continue with your words.
I am sure there are over 500 bike shops in cairo.
I know one in rahab.
Did he say how much he paid?
I need figures.
Oh wow.
Probably double.
Can you send me a map link?
Yeah that is too much.
Yeah, I do not have enough money for two yet.
Because I need helmets, lights, and bikes.
And locks.
In heliopolis?
You could phone them.
Every place has a number.
People here have two phones each.
One phone is too many.
I only know my flat.
I know a coffee shop.
And lots of home shops.
And a big one called city stars.
This sounds like pokemon red/blue.
I will wait until I get the bike token.
Did you play pokemon red/blue?
Then never mind.
This is our task.
If three people know about a secret it is not a secret.
Quick, eliminate your friend.
We have time.
I only have 2250 in savings right now.
I should have 4500 on the 5th.
I really need to get my vote in this time.
I thought I had to sign it.
Looks complicated.
95% sure I have to sign it.
You signing it would be illegal.
Also, proxy vote requires a signature.
I can print the form out and send it to you.
Should be plenty of time.
They will know. They will compare it to my signature I used for registration.
It is the only form of verification.
The vote was today, right?
I heard the parliment needed 2/3rds to call a general election early.
No, the parliment vote for a general election on in June.
Announced by Theresa May that she wanted it, and that the parliment would vote on it the next day.
This is not a dictatorship, she can not just declare things.
She already introduced a new law that made general elections 5 years apart.
She is a cheater.
Calling elections whenever she thinks she can win more power.
Get ready for 50 years of conservatism.
They also gerrymandered the voting regions. Effective next year.
England have no party that can even come close to the organisation of the conservatives.
The snp should rename and start running in england.
The general election is first past the post, so vote for snp.
scottish parlimentary are proportional, so vote the best party running.
There was a referendum 8 years ago or something to make the uk general elections proportional.
aka, fair and ungamable.
But it was voted against.
Because propaganda.
At that point you have to lose hope.
It is the reason the conservatives have something like 65-70% of the power, and only 35% of the votes.
The level of misreprensentation is at a record high.
I am fine and the job is fine.
Just peanut butter.
I have the ingredients for the bread.
But not made it yet.
Am I collecting interest on it?
I am waiting for someone to come visit so I can order electronics.
Okay.
A new intel nuc probably.
A new mouse too.
And maybe a razor.
What...?
A nuc is not a laptop.
Well, we will wait until the time.
i mini computer.
The one I have already.
But newer.
Depends if it is expensive.
hello
Hello.
Hey
Hi.
Hello.
HELLO
I fixed my chat computer thing.
So no more not replying quickly.
We have gin.
Hi.
Are you alive.
Hi.
Mariam.
Mariam Morad.
Mariam A Morad.
Mariam Ahmed Morad.
Mariam Ahmed with family name Morad.
A.K.A Mariam my Morad.
MMM
No, not really.
You can tell by my zero mistake policy.
I will go to bed.
Why :(
I am here.
Why before I fall.
It is much closer.
Oh wow.
I never even knew.
At the same time I explicitly told you to tell me if you send anything because there are no postmen.
Noticed you downloaded Arrival.
Worth watching?
We will order food.
What about panda?
You can play the piano?
Oh.
I would say give it a miss.
Did you go?
It could have been a lot better if things were not spelled out to you.
Do you want to do fan research?
Are you fine?
I had fateer.
Now I need to cleanse my soul.
OHHHHH
Hmmmmm.
I would say not until later.
Coming home in five minutes.
Oh wow.
Hi.
Four years ago.
Hi.
HOW R I?
Who R u?
Hello.
Hello!
Hi.
hello
hellohi
Where did you go.
HELLO
HELLO
in 15 seconds.
hi
Okay final test everything will work.
Send in ten.
Test.
I am glad.
One month left?
Hahahahahahahaha :D
Do we need to celebrate?
Yes, yes.
OHhhhh someone has all the time.
The notifications are working perfectly.The internet, not so much.
Why.
Make sure you bring your keyboard home.
Are you happy?
Do not.
This is your oppurtunity.
I am really happy you manage to quit.
d
Cards?
Oh.
They should have used GTK3
Why would they bother to write their own client?
* gui
gtk3 scaling works fine, gtk2 does not scale.
Qt is just better I think.
But not enough software.
qtbrowser uses chrome under the hood, and pcmanfm has a qt port.
And qbittorrent.
So is today your last day, or tomorrow, or a week, or a month?
We are working thursday, but have friday, saturday, sunday, and monday off.
Actually, off thursday, friday, sunday.
Coming home.
Be home!
Mariam.
Peter Broderick - Part 4: The Dream
A song.
Are you going to draw them?
Are you in an elevator?
Are you growing to take care of them?
You are growing to take care of them.Hi.Are you in an elevator?
Have you tried sitting down?
Can you not ask for different medication?
Okay, say hi.
Yeah, I went through all of them.
Here too.
A hot little drop of oil cut my leg.
Did you hear the song I sent?
Coming home now.
Come in.
I am fine.
Are you?
no...
Keith is the worst.
Drugurphiles everywhere.
Mooorrrning.
Magdy bought 4 air conditioners.
Okay.
I am coming home in five minutes.
Where are you.
Do you know where toka is?
Yeah, sure.
No, she just came home.
I said bye, I love you, and kissed you.
At 8:20.
Yeah, sure, send it and remind me in five hours from now.
Yeah.
setxkbmap us
Which game do you want?
Might set up port forwarding on the home router so I can access the computer from work.
Poo?
Oh
cd games/enter-the-dungeon
cat start.sh
copy the output to me in riot
sudo reboot
Oh wow.
Unplug any usb or sdcards other than the samsung.
Then just hold the off button to restart.
A personal statement?
You have a cv, and a cover letter.
WHO HAS FOUR DAYS OFF IN A ROW
YEAH YOU HEARD RIGHT
** the first
Coming home in five.
When are we meeting.
Test.
When do you need it for?
Like a form?
Hate those.
Yeah, okay.
Make sure to say you only like carrots raw and presoaked.
I will go to where you go.
Yes.
When is it?
You would have to tell me before I give the I am leaving signal.
Once I have left, you have to turn up.
It has to be pretty accurate.
And the place does too.
I have no form of communication once I leave.
I will take a clock.
I can take a flag.
I will tell you what colors I am wearing.
Well, if it is in, I will get lost and not be on time. Maybe.
Where do you know in there?
6 apparently.
Wait.
The main gate.
30 minutes ish.
I will check though.
I will be early.
No, I am not that bad.
Come on.
Which places do you know inside it?
Did you panic attack?
Is it just the lying you are panicking about?
No, that is 6.
Wait, I am mapping.
Exactly here.
At the outer gate part.
Tell me what you will wear just in case I do not recognise you.
We have hungout.
You understand me, right?
Then there is mish mish kila.
Happy.
It has been four years.
I interviewed a Brazilian programmer over skype a month ago.
It was awkward.
And today I met them.
My only question was "why?"
Maybe.
But we have talked every day for four years.
It is up to you.
I wonder most if I can confidently recognise you.
Mariam.
Will you send a photo?
Can you send the vieod.
Why would you delete it.
It is my only video.
No no hold one, work called.
No, just now.
From home though.
Will you look like all your photos?
Do you think you look worse in real life?
No, you will look the best.
(approved by toka)
I  love yout. 
Toka approves.
This is the first toka approval.
Anything apparently.
We have talked a lot.
I don't want to worry you.
:(
Wake up.
Okay.
I can only manage 220KiB/s.
I just sent an email to them complaining that their password login system is bad.
Divinity in an hour or so?
Without quality options?
Almost possible.
Bitrate is too high though.
I am off to buy food though.
Why did you not sleep?
Why won't you make it?
Okay, well tell me the next date.
I am off for the next four days.
Weekend, then just two public holidays, but not really, but these days are better for everyone.
Quality options are only when the stream gets > n viewers.
Did you decrease the bitrate?
Still buffers.
Nah, good enough.
Wow, yeah that is low. 70-80KiB/s by my measure.
Oh wow, health potions?
Is it more of an arcade game?
I need to make twitch account to spam your chat.
Yeah. I like the slowly regenerate over time system. Or a more survival type and you have to heal injuries.
Yeah I saw it.
Towerfall accension is a good local co-op game.
Hard.
No idea. Worked fine for me.
The movement and attacks feel responsive and fair.
I remember that.
It might have been, but when we did fix that, it was not multiplayer.
Yeah.
Not yet.
Still eating.
10-15 minutes.
Remember, I can not log into my account.
Playstation exclusive.
Send me yours.
A game costs a 22% of my monthly wage.
They probably do.
I never buy games any more.
I gave nintendo too much money.
The switch will be the next money sink for me.
But again, not until a good library exists.
A pc would be.
It will in five years.
Hello?
20m
Hello?
Hello Mariam.
At home.
I was meant to.
Playing with ip quality of service settings.
No.
I am just waiting.
Saturday and Sunday.
Will not be on tonight.
Too late now.
Okay.
Wow I actually thought this was a joke.
Better than the new 3ds though, right?
Bigger screens vs 3d.
Was just going to go on for 20 minutes.
Will be on tonight too.
Ben, open the map, zoom in.
Think we are way way too low on power.
Do you know the ratio for these new things?
What temperature does the steam come out the engine?
You googled?
100 steam at 165c comes out the end of it.
Can we reboil it?
Right, have to go.
Will be back later.
I think I will move our old minecraft save to the vps too.
I hope it is thursday.
Okay, an hourish and I can play.
What is your dinner schedule?
I am fine.
We are going to the Nile Country Club tomorrow morning.
Okay, joining.
A swimming club?
Mariam.
Hi.
What will you do tomorrow.
Yeah, link?
HELLO
Got it.
Do you put the zip in the folder, or extract?
Give that a try.
Are you home yet.
Yeah, it works now.
Next step, 100% nuclear.
They are, yes.
Will be able to play a lot tommorrow morning.
I think.
Are you okay?
I am okay too.
I saw toy tanks today and thought of Hla.
Did you see this?
I think it should still be in the matrix history.
I did not check.
We have sent a lot.
It was super cold, but fun. And the weather was windy and hot so that was fine.
The included dinner was good too.
It was pasta and salad and some tahina with bread.
Which sounds quite plain, but it was tasty.
Toka could not match your flying squirrels today.
No, I want pictures.
We never took a camera.
What is the purple one?
I want to grow some fruits.
Or coffee.
Good morning.
Are you alive?
I am ready.
Ready?
You are the only admin for some reason.
Night is just a pain.
I am alive.
Shall we update to 15.5?
Been updates everyday with bugfixes.
Nah.
Mod compat is per minor version.
These are patch versions.
One moment.
15.5 right?
Hmm, risky.
Should be updated now.
I have my own desk :D
I have my own desk :D
With privacy and quiet.
Never seen hurricane before.
I would just draw wiggly horizontal lines.
Where else?
I noticed that once.
Restart Firefox?
They must have a history with crazy employees.
Or a history of thinking employees are crazy.
Pretty much.
3
For who? When?!
Jesus that is forever away.
To where?
September is hot.
Mummy is not coming?
Going to have to start a packing checklist.
And shopping list.
My vegan cookbook.
Plug it in to charge.
4
When did you come to Cairo before?
Was it just the wedding?
Going to be hot.
You have to take all my games.
And the wiimotes.
A mistake, also space.
I forgot a lot.
I will. Also send photos of all my stuff so I do not forget anything.
Crack would help too.
Actually, just checked, not that hot.
Ask toka though.
Do you have her on riot?
She can see all this.
Spiritual... cancel the flights.
The word you are looking for is superstitious.
And what you really mean is you would rather not have to tell people about a negative turn in events.
No, my sister does not believe in ghosts.
...
Why did you apply?
You have no license, experience, or training.
Flying as in aeroplanes, right?
Flying what?
Sure, but you have zero experience with free falling.
The interview should fail you.
Or they will try to sell you training.
As long as it is free training.
What do you want to do in Cairo?
What will Linda want?
You could disable the screen while you're at work.
OHMY
Your container.
Are we having misa2a today?
I am mega hungry.
Nope.
What are you craving?
We have the AC here :D
16-17, no idea.
Okay.
Yeah I have heard of it.
Or came across it.
I have no knowledge of it though.
No idea.
In all the rooms.
They were wondering whether to put it as 22 or 24, and I said 27 (the current temperature).
Will mummy stay with us too, or with linda?
I think less than 24 might be jumper weather.
The museum is really good.
So, books are flighted now?
Does linda have any plans on where to stay?
Do not let me forget to put the voting forms on a pen drive and print next week.
Might end up being my last chance.
I mean, I am not going to order it and get it taken here :D
Okay.
We will have a look around for hotels.
Nope.
Airport?
Do we just book a careem that day?
Maybe.
We will just book a taxi that day.
Does linda want to spend more for a better place to stay, or just standard like we stayed in?
Are you excited about it?
Emma, brenda, linda, you, and who?
Who is Calum?
What happened to Brendan?
He does not want to go by choice?
Where?
He values being home alone more than visiting egypt?
He prefers to be on a computer to travelling?
That seems a bit odd.
What does he do on it?
Are you seeing this?
I will check my email.
Open it.
No reply yet.
Brendan.
Brendan would rather stay at home on the computer than come to Egypt.
How old is Brendan?

What about rooms, is emma staying with mummy?
Leaving in 18 minutes.
What is Calum like?

Updated to 6.1 then python was a peice of shit.
Why is it so pointy?
For which video?
No.
You no longer work for BESA.
He does not deserve your help.
Let him suffer for being a bad person.
Are you a card trader now?
:(
I told you.
Demented little children.
Teaching children to be little monotone drones.
Not on.
It is cold.
No videos at work :O
Maybe we can use the black eye peas.
dmenu 4.7 came out.
Not much different I think.
I think I am the same.
What the fuck.
xit
Oh wow.
Was every penny there?
Nah, just be glad he did not refuse to pay you.
Two days pay for a 0 day notice is worth it.
Was I a hand?
You usually get 300 right?
3000
You you want me to clear the amount you owe and cat food this month?
I might, I will let you know asap.
COMING FIVE MINUTES.
Maybe not tonight, but tomorrow for sure.
Did I have hands?
Are you dreaming of me dying?
Can you?
Yes if you can.
Maybe 9.
I am fine.
A little tired because I missed my tea.
Are you fine?
Good morning.
Do you know yet?
Could or will, because If you can not ditch them in time, I will be waiting without notice.
One moment.
30 minutes.
If you prefer gate six: 40m.
They have not replied.
Is it urgent?
About what?
How long should I wait?
Are you going to be there?
While you are in a lecture?
Can you not wait until the end of it?
Message me first though.

Hold on.
Not sure which ward you guys are in.
Okay what is the meeting time now?
Okay.
Let me check my clothes.
I will wear a red t-shirt and dark dark grey trousers.
Hold on.
Maybe.
When I go in I will check the map and find the right one.
Back up plan is at 3pm, cut off 3:30pm.
Meeting is 2:30pm.
Heldon and Laich right?
Have you left?
I am leaving in 9 minutes.
I am leaving in 9 minutes.
Nah.
Nah.
Nah.
Now what?
I am leaving now.
Tomorrow toka is out a lot.
When I banish her from the pc she uses the phone and kills the internet.
The pi2 can run firefox, but it is just annoyingly slow.
And I use my pi2 as an exclusive matrix chat screen.
Is it the original?
Yeah, I would say the pi3 would be just good enough for general purpose.
I was home quite a while ago.
WHY DID YOU DELETE IT
UNDELETE
There is this.
Eventually you will be home though.
You can stop being so sorry.
Everything is fine.
Is it the council elections today?
Quick go vote!
Moray Council currently has 10snp/10ind/3con/3lab
Yeah. Is James running again?
Anyway, preferential voting, so green 1, snp 2, lab 3.
Unless the scottish socialist party run, but that never happens.
Preferential voting, if your first candidate does not win, your second choice counts, and so on.
One of the only sensible voting systems.
Where did you go?
Want to play now?
Just leave it until after the vote.
Okay, just send a message.
What is monopoly deal?
The small one?
Is it the same game?
Oh wow, an english one?
I have looked for those.
That's what she said.
That made me confused too, but I accepted it.
To vote?
That seems early to shut.
Oh.
Yeah that does look like Mohab.
Game time?
J..q
Hmmm
Want to get 0.15.6?
My speed is at 50KiB/s...
Curiously the router is connected at 3000kb/s
We do not pay for that fast.
Think I should download it to france then scp it?
50 seems dodgy.
Also, have you managed to download it with a command line?
Chrome and firefox ditch a download if it fails.
It is pathetic.
It could download 3GiB, internet could drop for a second and it just deletes it.
I think it generates a one use download token.
Nah, not worth it at this speed.
2.5 hours.
Not sure why downloading from factorio is so slow, other sites are the correct speed.
And no way to commandline download to get multiple connections.
I will download it over night.
I have plenty of time tomorrow.
You have encountered an unexpected error.
When you click download.
Every time.
Sounds like all windows and mac software.
Was I anything like what you expected?
How high did you expect me to be?
I am not that thin.
I am around 65kg.
I was as high, though.
that high.
I think you were as expected.
Anything unexpected I brought up, I think.
I expected you to be shyer, maybe.
I am very happy we met.
No.
Can you hear me?
I told toka about the girl we saw.
I told her you were the same height as me.
Disappoint with what?
Who did you think I thought you were?
Never.
How could you think that.
Come back.
Hi.
Oh this is nice.
Are you going to paint me from memory?
I bought some turkish coffee.
Hey come in.
Yesterday was the best thing.
ben
Whoops, vpn.
Neither am I.
Was I as white as you expected?
Ready for some factorio?
Are you seeing the scottish results so far?
+104 to the conservatives.
They game is becoming unplayable.
Everything seems fine.
Nah.
I am not interested.
I am too private.
Wake up.
Give me a message when you are back.
Hi Mariam.
Already in.
I can not call.
No idea why.
You try?
Let me restart firefox.
A one person party.
Hi.
Are you fine?
I am.
What are you doing?
Come back.
Berries really are the best fruits.
Has no political alignment to a party.
Votes whatever they want with no consistancy. 
If you can not find another person with the same views as you, you need to read a book on politics and figure out what you believ.
Local elections get a lot of independants because people know them, and they make issues about local problems.
John from hopeman thinks fishing is important. What can he do by himself? Nothing. But he convinced people to vote for him because everyone agrees fishing is important.
Who knows.
Scotland lost 158 seats to the conservatives.
The uk is just doomed.
It is the fall of labour.
They are gone.
After the conservatives started catering to facsism.
The conservatives went full ukip.
They cheat. They do anything to get votes.
England have first past the post local elections.
How fucked is that?
Single vote. One choice.
32% vote A, 31% vote B, 30% vote C, A wins 100% of the power.
Just like the fucking general elections.
If fptp is not bad enough, we still have an appointed upper house, the house of lords.
And a fucking monarchy.
Hi.
I was about to sleep.
It is work tomorrow.
But not really.
Sleep is more important.
I will go.
Goodnight Mariak.
Bad or good?
Phew.
Good morning!
When is it that you leave?
What if I do not make it home by then?
Is it bad?
I am wondering how important me being there before you go to the interview is to you.
It is payday and soha wants to see me a last time.
Hmmm maybe.
I as super hungry.
I miss fool :(
Are you fine?
Hmmm, can you check on the way home today?
And if they are buy everything.
We do not check that often.
GRAB EVERYTHING
Love you.
I am home.
Be back.
I will play for about an hour.
Why.
Yep.
Steel?
Mooooooornning <3
duckduckgo just had a special result format for searching the aur.
Dovecot 2.3 has planned jmap support, which could be pretty cool.
Enough beeeesa.
Besa is history.
What are you doing?
Do you want to meet half way to the pet shop?
Only if you want to.
A lot to carry though.
Two bags, and a double size litter bag.
But depends on what stuff they have.
Maybe we can get them a real litter tray.
Maybe something new for them too.
I will give you an exact time to leave.
I did.
Did you?
What did you have?
No.
I can not text.
5pm.
But if that changes or your plan changes, one of us will be waiting.
So just meet at the house?
Better stock up on ammo.
Reply?
The chance of one of us waiting more than 10 minutes is too high.
Oh, at the house.
5:40pm.
With shotwell, yes.
Hi.
Are you fine?
Moooooooring <3
If it is boring, DO NOT BLAME ME.
Restart?
The smell destroyed me.
I am fine.
What will you do today?
Nothing, or nada?
Am I interupting the film?
All websites suck.
I am fine. But I need tea.
Restart?All websites suck.
Hmmmm I think not.
I vote brocolli rice.
Fried with soya.
Hmmmm, misasia2
When?
We had pasta yesterday and nothing before that for a few days.
But it is so good.
What is this for?
Noooooooooo.
Start programming :D
Get an internship at magdsoft.
Never move to philly.
Why.
We could cycle to work together.
Because working together would be great.
We do have lots of bread.
Because working together would be great.
Like all the iterns here :D
Leaving after I pee in five minutes.
Hi.
Me too.
Come in.
I would really really not take that with the penalty.
You need to phone them now and bargain it.
The whole thing stinks.
Accept no less than zero penalty.
Selling your labour should not be a gamble.
Then do not sign it.
They can fuck you hard.
They own you for a year.
That is not your responsibility.
You are not buying a service.
Staff training is not your cost.
It is theirs.
You would never buy the training if it were not for the work.
No, they must take the risk and only hire people who they think will stay.
No cars.
Can you imagine when you wanted to leave BESA they told you you had to pay 15,000k to leave.
I am trying to work too and typed in the wrong place.
You would seriously hate your life.
It is just not acceptable.
The fine is not even payable.
You literally can not leave for a year, that is the only outcome of the contract.
And that is not choice.
It is not free labour. 
It is slavery.
A worker should always be working by choice.
I think you should 100% not take that job with any early termination fee.
I also think you should be picky about your next job.
You have time.
Just check regularly, and apply for things that excite you and have no catches.
You seem to get a lot of interviews and offers as a percentage.
You have choice.
Hold on, prayer time.
No not me, they wanted the room.
It is very very hot today.
Lying scum.
We should.
Are you going to be home when I get home?
Bring the sweet sweet noodles :D
Okay.
Leaving a little earlier today because I have been leaving too late.
Leaving in 5 minutes!
Love you.
Are you fine?
Oh wow we will finish it today.
My feet are super sweaty; I have no socks.
I doubt they are going to back down on that condition.
Try to call again.
Hello.
key ara right?
I can improve and add the key program to the menu, and terminal.
No, that was a mistake.
The hand blender is much easier.
Yeah, give it a rest.
Mmmmmm peanut butter, and jam.
Leaving soon.
Starting to look like the typical countryside map.
That is pretty funny.
Yep.
I am not even sure it is that thought out.
tftp, yeah that one.
I might come on in a bit.
Why have you disappeared?
I mean for the last week.
Are you fine?
Are you ready?
I am.
But tired and hot.
You are telling me.
I had to keep stopping on the way to work to splash water on my head.
Because of the heat?
GO BUY THE FAN
Where are you moving.
15 minutes.
Oh no work tomorrow!
The client cancelled that thing.Yeah.
It is, it is.
YOu call.
WHY
Where are you going.
Wait.
COMING TO SAVE YOUR FINGER
I am excited to go outside in the heat.
Oh wow I forgot about the personal statement.
expert 7*
I think he is entering numbers, but half of the time he is just fidgiting.
But you do not know where yet.
I will play tonight.
I need that mod.
AND WHEN WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY
Was it yesterday?
I did not update, I just could not get 1.1.
You updated autofill?
One moment.
Betterbelts
No sound?
No idea, we replaced it I think.
With a mod with the same color panels.
Hi.
Let me restart firefox.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
I can hear you.
Wait.
I am, but just super super hot.
IT IS MY WEEKEND
I will play a game with ben.
Why is it messy.
Come back.
Is it so messy it will take all night?
Coal liquefaction requires steam now.
Why are you leaving.
It is too far away.
For 1RPM factory you need around 14 blue belts of iron. And that is with full production modules.
Outlast 2 exists...?
Do you want to move there?
Maybe it will be super quiet.
When do you want to meet again?
Yes.
I will say yes if I have no commitments.
I have moved so many times it is easy for me.
Yeah.
Let me count.
12 times.
Egypt.
I have lived in 11 places, and helped my parents move 4 times.
Well, it would be suprising if you had.
Completely alone, or just not with parents?
Yeah, not living with parents gives you freedom to do anything you want.
Everything preceeded by java is boring.
Ready?
Loaders extract from a chest to a belt.
I saw that. Is it a new game?
As in not a classic.
I still want the video you made.
14 mk 3 solars now.
Did you see that video on r/videos of the history of the world or something?
NOT BAD, HOW ARE YOUR THINGS?
A second holiday?
Hi mariam are you fine now that you are twenty?
Which powers did you get?
Eyyyyyyyyy.
I want to be able to remember your real face.
HI NADA? AND MARIAM
You look older in this photo.
I am home.
Come in.
What are you doing.
Wake up.
Acdefg, hijklmnop, qrst, uv and wxy.
No.
Will you send you.
I have forgot your face.
I only saw it for an hour or so.
It is hard to visualise faces.
Now that I am trying I feel sad at how  impossible it is.
Do you think seeing a real face is different to a photo?
In a photo it looks something like you, but in real life it is you.
Oh, photos do not move.
Send me a 3d video :)
I still love all your photos though.
Did you sleep.
I just killed a mosquito that was bursting with blood.
I though I scared you away.
Does it have me?
I never know why she is taking photos.
I wish riot had a voice button.
I could probably do it, but I have never contributed to a big project.
And why have they not done it already. They must have a reason.
Toka and a friend.
The quality as awful too.
>"There was no consensus on the formats to be supported, so it's still unmerged. I currently do not have the time to create a proposal for it, but I believe the core team would welcome one if it was created and then it could be merged."
The code is actually written.
I could pull the code and merge that branch and send you an apk.
Oh no.
Forget everything.
The iOS code is completely different.
As is the web.
Did this audio work?
Did audio ever work?
On the iPhone?
They are watching something.
Why.
Why.
I have earplugs but they hurt my ears when I sleep with them.
And why are they still here.
I woke up late so I am not really tired.
I want water.
What do you want?
When will it?
Will you have a long break?
Oh this is not too long away.
Will you visit every weekend?
Here is my giant head.
Good morning.
Are you awake.
Wakkkkkkkke uppppppppp.
WHAT IS UP
UP DOG?
WHAT IS THE DEAL
I am fine.
Day is passing very quickly.
Where are you going?
And what is the suprise?
Hmmmmm bread.
Get what?
Of course you do not.
There was nothing to get from it.
Only the most intelligent people can understand the alphabet.
Pretty advanced stuff.
What could they possibly do tomorrow, hmmmmmmm.
The suprise.
WHAT IS IT
I have no money.
I think if you try hard enough you too could know the alphabet.
Okay.
The song was great.
Do we go for bread when I get back?
Okay, going to get up and see if anyone needs anything before I leave.
Still ten minutes though.
Hi.
Are you home.
I got two knockoff ps2 controllers for 3.20gbp.
One usb cable, then a cable between the two.
Suprising just works.
Pretty much identical to the ps2 ones, but with four buttons for the d-pad.
Where are you.
1.60gbp each.
These ones do.
What do you prefer?
The 360 had concave, right?
Yeah, I think I know that problem.
Digital I think.
Yeah.

Not using steam.
Just a tonne of gg games.
So far all the games default bindings have been decent, but they have also had okay in game options for them.
Mainly small 2d games though.
Are you alive.
WHAT IS THE SUPRISE
This looks like the man spreading woman.
WAS LAST NIGHT GOOD?
WHEN DID YOU GET HOME?
GOOD MORNING <3
Why is it the best morning.
Yes.
But what is the suprise.
I doubt they are informed, and I highly doubt it is how they think.
"Opened the door"
With a guard at the door selecting who they want.
I doubt it is any different to any other country's policy.
Immigrating from the USA to canada is not trivial.
Scotland has the top anti-descrimintion laws in the world, but that did not help.
I am not being discriminated against here, or targeted by the government.
These are refuge cases.
What will you do today?
Strong shower............?
What is the suprise.
WHAT IS IT
Is she a drug dealer.
Will I find out when I arrive home?
What if it does not happen.
Why would you even tell me if you had no intentions of telling me immedietly?
How could I wait longer than a day.
Who do you think I am?
Patient when it comes to waiting, impatient when it comes to not knowing.
Yeah..
Do you want rid of me?
WHAT IS SHE DOING
Are they fixing the corners of the couches?
Are they cleaning all the cat fur?
WHAT ARE THEY DOING
Is she making mashy?
Oh wow.
I GUESSED THREE THINGS
Mashy.
Some one is getting hunnnnnnngry.
Do you have strong command of msa?
modern standard arabic
Are you going to apply?
Okay phew.
Check the company first. Glass door too.
Then apply through the company website to skip the middle man :D
Why would they be posting an ad for 20 positions?
Because as someone who speaks english here, and if I have a serious emergency and I call emergency services, and the person is not good at english, I need someone.
It could mean a death if they hear me wrong and send the ambulance to the wrong place.
And I suppose it is easier to add you to the calls that require english (1-2% maybe), than to train all the egyptian call operators to be good at english.
Yeah, if you got an interview there I imagine they would test your translation of some practical things.
Is it on glassdoor?
What happened yesterday?
Was hazem a suprise?
Now you know how I feel.
I am leaving at ten fast five.
Because shitty work performance because people starve themself.
Same reason people will not want to employ a 8 month pregnant woman.
Is 61 enough keys?
Can you take a giant battery and take it to me?
What did Hazem get you?
Why did they get you things?
ARE YOU READY FOR THE BOX OF NOODLES
When will we get it.
Going to have HYPER MEGA SUPER UBER noodles for bed tonight.
But they are all late.
None of them gave you the secret of never being twenty though.
All you have to do is write 19 in any forms.
khalas
Okay, going to try and leave now.
Worst faceplant I have ever seen.
Just put your age as 19 on google and facebook and your id.
Dinner
Yeah, it is the secret.
Computer architecture sounds better.
I spell it wrong.
Why would you put it on the door?
We do not need soda; we have noodle juice.
Noodles are the food of champians. 
We even feed the cats just noodles.
Are you fine?
Hungry though.
GOOD MORN
What class is your favourite?
The gray T class.
ABE IS FINE
Are you tead up?
Breafastedup.
Anising it now.
We will have the mashy hot, right?
Did you finish the book?
Then that!
Or programming :D
ME THE BEST INTRODUCER
Just got flash backs to when I was not in egypt..............
Leaving in about 10-15 minutes.
We can look for single player ones that you might like.
SOME ONE IS HUNGRYYYYYYYYYY AND TANGYYYYYYY.
Will you show me all the gifts you got?
Are you alive.
What is wrong.
There are no games you want to play?
Snort them.
And irrigate your colon with the soya sauce.
Or donate them to our collection.
You are the noodles.
You have transcended.
I always get very confused playing a keyboard with less than 88 keys.
My fingers get lost.
Are you going to write a song?
Baaaby.
Your days are not good enough to repeat?
Oh it was when you asked if I was going to give you the secret to not being twenty.
Hi.
Are you at Salma's?
Are you going to write a song about your fingers getting lost?
Going to be late.
Hopefully not too much longer now.
Leaving now.
Where are you.
For days?
Hi.
I am okay.
One more day before the weekend :D
Are you sad I never got something for your birthday and everyone else did?
I wanted to check.
I think I interperated some writing that way after it.
I do not remember now.
I can go back and check if you want.
PaulBut they are all late.None of them gave you the secret of never being twenty though.MariamThey were late so they can all give them to me together.Will you give it to me?PaulAll you have to do is write 19 in any forms.khalasMariamWhat?PaulJust put your age as 19 on google and facebook and your id.MariamWhy would I do that?

I think you have never said alright to me before.
Alright.
Baaaaaaaby.
Good morning.
Is it this saturday, or next?
Not yet then.
Why?
Are you leaving in 30 mins.
DO WELL
the line below the bottom line is c.
ARE YOU HOME YET
Good afternoon.
25p for 8 peaches.
Second thing I tried after a tree.
Official kotlin support on android.
And android studio 3.0.
And with kotlin native becoming a thing, native compiled android apps could be near.
"Android runtime (ART) is the managed runtime used by applications and some system services on Android. ART and its predecessor Dalvik were originally created specifically for the Android project. ART as the runtime executes the Dalvik Executable format and Dex bytecode specification."
Had to look that up.
Still byte code.
Android 7 brought JIT to ART which apparently complements the ahead of time compiler.
Art is a run time.
Native code needs no runtime.
That seems a bit clearer.
kotlin should be compilable on any verson though.
I guess lenovo used x86.
Hi.
Spotify caches the data, so uses as much and more than just keeping the songs.
Yeah, but the app once you run out of space will start deleting old songs to get space for the new songs.
And the songs can be deleted by android at any time.
And when the app is uninstalled.
And spotify is riden with ads.
Count up from that.
Not really. 
It was my first and the reason I tried.
Where is tagamo3?
Hello.
I am fine.
Are you?
I am baking bread.
When are you moving?
Actually no.
Finally made the bread.
Have you tried your keyboard yet?
You can try to play nouvea bianche
C is the one to the bottom left of the two black keys.
I think.
If it is a black to the right, it is the letter + # (sharp).
Os a C# is a note on the line below the bottom with a # and is the first of the two black keys.
A flat is the same key but half down.
So C# is the same as Dflat
Okay go gog ogo.
No. But that whole thing does not matter anymore.
She asked me a while ago what I thought about getting one.
And I had no idea how to react so I told her.
It is the bread and peanut butter I made.
I am going to buy a bike now.
Toka is soon.
I got a bike.
I am not cycling to your new citly though.
I am still in season 4 of the x-files.
Also, lets encrypt is down.
And my lost.host expires today at some point.
Probary should not have reft it so rate.
I am still in season four of the x-files.
I am not cycling to your new city though.
Oh god I am sweaty.
I got here before nine.
But I had to tie the bike to another bike which is almost evil.
I will ask magdy if he knows a place I can lock it to.
Oh shit.
I did renew though.
Tell me any commands you need.
Also, yeah, I forgot the helmet too.
I told you what I know.
I also have 46 packs of nooooodles.
I saw it going out, but I could not double check because I did not see it outside.
15 minutes, yeah I forgot how much effort it takes.
Back is all downhill.
Second hand from a 16-17 year old.
It came with a lot of stuff.
Everything I would need.
120gbp
For that price it is.
Super cheap.
Nah, but if you want a bike, buy it here.
You have wifi?
Be good.
The workers?
Remember, be confident and reject an offer below 4000.
They might offer higher if they just spent time training you.
I am getting a key to the office :D
Where are you?
I miss you.
Only takes me 10-15 minutes to go to and come from work now.
As far as I am aware, the currency is pretty stable right now.
I doubt it will change.
Ageeees ago.
The whole back journey is downhill.
I barely peddle.
Check to see if what defrosted?
The mashy is out.
Yes.
What no.
I just took it out.
Oh I will have noodles too then!
I have not had anything yet.
You have to up your daily dosage.
How was the training?
WILL DO NOW
Are you close?
HERE
HOW LONG WAS I
Yeah.
But going to have a key :D
The morning is quiet and faaaast internet.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
A steel frame makes it really heavy.
And we barely have 1800.
I guess get them to send a photo.
Hello.
Aluminium is metal.
The body is almost the whole bike.
Second one is ready to snap.
First one is not womanly enough.
THe first one is just a normal bike with a slight curve.
Maariiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Why not naser city?
10 minutes exactly from leaving the office door to being at this computer.
Yeah.
Where are you.
Where is the branch you picked?
20km, are you crazy?
Why would you not pick nasr city?
Okay.
Do I boil the <3ttle?
No or on?
Saving 1 hour a day.
I feel like you are probably going to be waay longer than me with travel time.
No, because 5th settlement.
You are going to be 1.5-2 hours travelling a day.
Okay sure but you have long days.
I have 37.5 hour weeks.
In scotland I worked 38 hour weeks, which was awful, then 30 hour weeks.
I do not know, between 40 and 48 by the sounds of it.
Mariam.
Are you moving today.
Yeah, they seem to think that everyone will hate it.
But that change just looks great.
As long as the shortcuts use any stack in my inventory.
MARIAM
Will you show me everything?
I am fine.
I remember a question I had for you.
A month or so ago I scrolled through your instagram or facebook or something with toka.
And you posted a lot of car things.
But you have never mentioned cars to me.
But do you like cars?
Yes.
Are you working for him?
I thought you were really into cars and I never knew and I was confused.
Quick make it your room already.
For your room?
Make sure it is the size of the wall.
Or you can get a round one and ask it who is the prettiest of the all.
Pfffffff, the question was not handsomest. 
Seems I am not eligible.
It is based on residency.
I was there to answer questions about what we can do with the app.
The client is happy with it, just wants a few changes.
I think I will just until my usual home time.
Hi.
They will when I send my voting by proxy form.
Which I think I am going to miss the dead line for the general election.
Maybe.
I think I am sending it friday or saturday.
Airmail is fast, so I still have a chance.
What time do you leave?
Are you at the meeting?
COMING HOME.
I MISSED MASSIVE MAGBREAKFAST
I will be 5-10 minutes then leave.
Hello.
Is your room made yet?
Did you get a mirror?
Was it round?
You have internet?
And you can call them?
I am leaving now.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Hi.
Which vegetables?
Hopefully.
Yeah, but when would she make it?
At her home?
The hob...?
Coming homeeeeeeeeee.
Did you answer yet?
2 peices.
Can you phone?
She never came back.
I am now.
WHAT DID I FORGET
That metal?
Was it white hot?
Did you take a photo?
Did you pour water on it?
I need some entertainment for a nights worth of gas.
No idea but not the time for me to think about it.
For school then work?
Ohhh.
Not bad.
More than you expected.
Toka started a new job yesterday.
As a teacher again, but for adults.
ALMOST MY WEEKEND
No not yet. In 30-40 minutes.
Why.
It is not late...
5ish is my finish time.
GUESS WHO LOCKED CRAZY EYES IN THE BEDROOM
IS THIS PAYBACK FOR LEAVING THE HOB ON
A la g3am ya habibi.
Not yet.
Having the fool first.
We can have the misahatesoth when you get home.
That symbol just crashed everything.
What is it?
Yeah.
Did you hear it or something?
Why was he there?
WHERE ARE YOU
WHERE
LOVE YOU
Factorio today?
Oh wait, mansura.
Damn.
Toka is back at work so I have free time again.
This one looks good, it has gears, painted handle frame, wheel guards, low frame, gear cover, comfy seat, 1200, and new.
BUT NOT CAIRO :(
HI
Oh then yes!
You do like it though, right?
Again.
Nope. 
Say yes and I will start downloading the latest version.
Abel Korzeniowski is really good.
Also come back.
No problem.
Going to give stelaris another try given the updates and now I have opengl 4.
Hope it runs well and I give ai equal rights.
What are you talking about?
I saw that one.
But it is a single bar.
And the handle bar is not painted.
It is bare metal.
Paint stops it rusting.
Look at all the old ones that used to be silver and they are brown.
Yeah no, the handle bar is not painted.
The black one looks way better.
1300 right?
For this one, right?
I would say yes, go for it.
We can use the other 300 to get you a helmet, lock and lights.
It is half way across the country.
That is fine.
300 would have been fine.
Terminal does not support rtl, or cursive.
I think they do not change for me.
Not gaming yet.
Waiting for a download.
But fixed two things.
And cleaned something.
And got something we need.
I still need to get it.
Wow, the uk was hot recently.
Going to buy 12kg of cat food today.
We have two cats...
two three months ago.
My weekend.
Okay.
Okay,
Hello.
Look how much it is.
12gbp.
Where are you.
No.
I have lived here for a year and a half now.
Moorrrrning.
Is anyone there?
Brush teeth?
It smells like food already.
Are you finished.
Okay.
Any time estimate?
Where will we get from?
Leave in 15-20 minutes?
So I should leave in 5-10 minutes?
Getting dressed and leaving.
Okay.
Can we get a Go board and play go?
Hi.
Could you push some code for me?
In a terminal
Paste that and press enter.
And then my password
heavily vanquish sudoku self chatter enrage impart
the menu
Oh yeah.
It is done.
Thank you.
Is it mashy night?
I am fine, yeah.
He wants me to come in for 8am this month.
So bed time is now 11:30 for me.
Around 4pm.
Probably earlier because I have no breakfast.
3:30ish.
He.
No. Hi.
w are you?
2.5 hours.
What?
I have only worked 5:15 so far.
Are you fine?
Yes.
I have to get up an hour earlier for work.
They leave earlier.
They put the ac on in my room at work and by the time it gets to 23 I am shivering.
27 seems to be a good level.
What is it.
Morning.
Why oh why do I have to use a hdd.
It is so slow.
Hard disk drive.
When are you leaving/home?
When are you home?
I am hooooooooome.
WHY NOT KALE CHIPS
Should I do anything?
omg I saw that.
I have no idea.
The cat did it.
Mmmm fateer.
Yes.
But where are you.
I have a sore back.
And rushed to finish some work.
This chair is bad.
I am so hungry.
When are you home today?
I can not leave until it is fixed.
What are you planning?
I AM HERE NOW.
Hmmmm here.
I am super super hungry.
I should leave but an error that I have to fix.
That is taking time.
JUST RIGHT NOW
Pushing everything.
Okay coming now.
Toka got her bike today.
Toka got her bike!
Come in.
SMEMSAA WHAT
Moooooooorning.
Are you working hard.
You have a long way to cycle.
I AM HOME
I am leaving in 15 minutes.
WHEN ARE YOU HOME
TAME EYES IS WAITING
When are you home?
I am going to have to complete the game today.
I had a bit of work to do, but I did it.
Food first I think.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Pancake things.
We just went together.
Toka is still very wobbly and crashy though.
mar
Toka crashed into a bus with her face.
Wow, fallout 3, new vegas, and oblivion drm free gog versions.
And morrowind.
Thinking about the nuc i7560 or whatever it is.
The double height one.
Has a iris 650.
But I want 32GiB of ram and a decent pci nvme ssd and not enough money.
Benchmarks put it roughly double the performance in everything cpu/gpu.
I run out with 16, had to enable zram.
Gradle is a bitch.
Yeah, I played it.
Worth playing.
Only 6-7 hours I think.
I played it in parts.
This is haram.
No no, she still has to learn.
Seems like a good deal.
Yeah no it is the worst thing I have ever seen.
Who the fuck would ever do that.
And it works with four sites........
Hi.
The bus was parked.
But she is bruised.
Also she works were you live.
I think so.
It is.
It was 2500.
Toka's was 1300 (new).
Mine was used, but looks pretty new to me.
We looked at every single bike on some second hand website.
There are loads.
500 a day maybe.
I will ask toka what it was.
What did she say?
When magdy came online I explained shortly but he never replied.
I feel like he just does know to reply.
I just want a "okay paul"
I should be finished work now.
Does not
7:30 I started.
What is wrong with it?
Is it your wrong ear?
Maybe I can look inside.
Not really.
Oh he finally replied.
Yeah sure, its okay, alf salama in arabic.
When are you home.
I have this sambosa thing with sugar an peanuts inside.
It is quite good yes.
Very sweet though.
25p for electricity this month.
Yeah.
Hi.
That was the worst night of my life.
Yesterday at 8am, and 1pm, I took a new muscle relaxant pill for my neck.
At 10:30pm I threw up everything.
Then, every twenty minutes until 8am, I threw up at the same time as my bum exploding dioreaha.
And every time I would get more faint.
I had to keep drinking 5 gulps of water after every time so at least there was something to throw up, and I did not pass out.
I was sick around twenty times.
It had to be a reaction to the medicine.
It has gone now.
And it was the only thing changed.
Did Ameny phone?
First medicine I do not work with.
I just woke up and came to the living room and almost fainted on the table.
I have been having lots and lots of water.
I think I need coffee because my head is death.
Also ants.
Could you take paracetamol home?
Oh we have some.
I first started getting it when I was 15 or so.
WE have enough.
Do they see the rating?
He took a loop and had no change.
And it cost 25.
I have no idea, but if the rating is annonymous 2.
Or 3.
Magdy is not here.
HI
I think not though.
I paid 30.
Did you get 5?
Internet at work was death.
I walked home.
He forgot the money today so tomorrow.
Bring watermelon?
Elections tomorrow.
FPTP so SNP.
First past the post.
They sent a load of the stuff to the new office today.
No no.
I think no one will.
The internet got faster!
1.8MiB/s now.
You are?
My stomach :(
I think I am hungry.
max size 1920 is good.
1280
Nope.
Factorio today?
Mariammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Did you forget about me?
Did you find somebody else?
Are you a ta3moga girl now?
Too busy for use cairians?
Maybe. I think she works there.
The site was hmmmmmmmm, I ASKED ABOUT THIS.
Was it ya ota?
Tomato.
ooooooooooota
Did I tell you about my sickness?
They are all going to be at the tomato?
My neck spasmed like usual.
And the first day I took a muscle relaxant.
But I ran out so at night we got a different type.
I took one at midday.
And one at 8am.
And at 10:30pm, I threw up everything.
Then, every 20-30 minutes, I vommited and had diareaha, and faint, and panicky at the same time.
Then I was okay for ten minutes in bed.
And it kept going on until 8am.
I was sick 20ish times.
It was the worst experience in my life.
So never taking that medicine again.
I know what it is.
Twice a year since.
I went to the hospital the first time.
Torticolis.
Have you started preclentching your rectum yet?
I am fine.
Are you bringing the watermelon.
Nop. I am desserted up.
I heard May is strapon shopping as we speak.
It worries me I know what that is.
I am.
One moment.
We can just not update.
Shit, I think tofu.world https ran out.
Does not matter for factorio though.
Just going to have a shower.
From today>
Can you hear?
Nope.
YOu call.
Nothing.
What is our backup?
I never found it again.
Yeah loads a black screen for me.
They probably will but fingers crossed.
Hoping for a labour snp coallition.
Yeah, staying up tomorrow night.
Ready whenever.
Actually, no, I forgot to download.
I have it now.
Mods updated too.
Yeah.
Okay.
I am so hot.
I have a towel over me with a bottle of ice.
I think it would be better to just move.
I was aware but that guy is good.
It was so hot.
Are you alive.
Wow.
Let me see.
The cold water is too hot to touch.
For dishes.
Yeah that seems like a huge defeat for snp.
Did you vote yet?
DISHES DONE AND WORKTOPS CLEANED
Are you coming home.
You are full of iftar but I want to order!
I mean, I want cabbage mashy
Yeah, I think it would be impossible.
I hope to god for anything collision.
I feel like lib dems would not team up with the snp or labour though.
I did too.
Want to hang out in a bit?
Maybe in half an hour when the results start?
To where what?
Right, I am ready.
Toka said the fifth settlement, but who knows.
I just want a quieter nicer flat.
The party with the most seats can not push any law with confidence because it can be voted down.
lib32-openssl100
Watching them now.
Off to a good start.
Exit polls suggest the conservatives might not get a majority.
A hung parliment.
Either parties have to team up to get more than half the seats, or the parliment functions without a majority.
Kind of.
The browser?
Jug.
NOOOOOOOOOO
It was looking good then Moray lost.
It hurts.
The DUP are just crazy though.
Yeah there is.
Anything happened?
When are we getting food from om mohammed :D
fr-om-non-om-mo-hammed
Okay.
Blueberry jam for dinner.
I really want breakfast.
The government.
My stomach is really really hungry.
The ma7shy?
WATERMELON
Tomorrow is the 5th.
No the 11th.
Nectarine.
Today is 10.
I got the bread.
Yeah I saw a few highlights in the video.
Any more stuff in the changelog?
Player stations...?
I thought that was just the ship.
But windows.
I heard vanquard is a very very good port.
Yeah, vanquish.
Ea...?
As in what games have you played by ea in the last decade?
When do you study?
:/
I did.
No, why?
Yeah, I will send them.
They should.
You remembered the password?
Send me a photo of you whitelisting one?
Did you not click remember me in the login?
Oh yeah.
I forgot when I read that.
Did you try anything there yet?
So?
Do you want to go to a country even worse than Egypt?
I can travel to something like 200 countries, I am not going to pick there.
We can save for somewhere in Europe I think.
Coming now.
Maybe you had to be controlling it to find it funny.
How did you make the orange juice?
We had some amman yesterday but it did not taste the same.
I did not use any sugar; the bag is already all sugar.
Yeah look at the ingredients.
Okay, but the sugar tasted weird.
Like bad sugar.
No the default sugar in the juice powder.
But yeah, the sugar here smells bad.
How much powder and sugar?
The bottle?
The back of the pack says 8 spoons per litre which is insane.
Yeah but it is not that important.
Just not familiar with the game at all.
Hi.
Are you fine?
I am.
We had watermelon yesterday.
The fruit is called nectarine.
We had a seedless one.
The metro sold seedless watermelons.
I had mashy and konefa.
And coffee and orange juice.
It is not that good.
I do have the little pancakes with blueberry jam.
I am listening to the This is Maha.
It was a giant cake.
It is crazy.
The song.
No.
Do you still have it?
Jesus, hard to believe he was the first minister.
Come back.
I had some fool.
Ah that makes sense.
There are a series of AngryPolicians right?
What is scorpio?
ben
Htc xboxonex
Minecraft windows 10 edition only launch title.
Your keys are hanging up next to the door.
Hello Mariam.
Where do you get dropped off on the way home?
I have been stuck on a problem for two days now.
Killing me.
For the ps4...
I know monster hunter stories for the 3DS.
Did you see that nintendo went on a ban wave on the 3ds?
Ooblets on linux?
Stardew valley mods work on linux now.
What platforms will Ooblets be available on?
It does look cute though.
Holy shit.
I can play tomorrow.
We might have to get better inserters.
Ukpolitics these days is seeming very anti conservative.
Quiz time:
Who locked the cat in the wardrobe this morning?
Is she a map theif?
Is she looking for forgotten underground war tunnels to break into banks?
Hurrrrry hooommme.
What do you want to eat?
I just sent it for the title.
I do not like it much.
Are we on 0.14 or 0.15?
Come back.
Are you finished exams now?
One more day until my weekend.
Did you try out my mega setup for one machine with speed modules and more new beacons?
No.
Why would you?
Is it because you do not meet me enough?
Wake up.
BABY
I am hungry :(
Are we having spring rolls?
What else do you want?
Roast potatoes?
Still want potatoes and spring rolls.
Tofu.world?
Might be factorio.
I should be on around 7pm.
It does take me long to connect to ssh.
But that could be my internet.
Might try restarting it.
What is weird about it?
Yeah but doing stuff.
Factorio is not a daemon.
I forgot the start command.
It might be running.
Actually I think not.
Not sure which save to load.
The latst auto save seems to be 23:25 last night.
Is that right?
Try that.
How hot?
Hahaha.
I wonder what the bandwidth of tofu.world is.
Actually, I think I know, 100Mbps up.
Looks like they do not care.
I will try to login tonight.
Not too hot.
Wake up wake up wake up.
Are you farming away?
Okay.
I have 2.5 more hours.
But I doubt I can stay that late.
So probably 1.5.
Output though?
Or did you start reprocessing nuclear stuff?
Yeah, is the center not unlocked yet?
28 I guess.
Okay coming home.
Hi.
What will you do tomorrow?
Why do you hate yourself?
You are the sweetest, not the self hatiest.
Tell me when you are playing.
Coming.
One moment while I clean up.
Hello.
What is it.
Top notch?
2/1 or 2.1?
2 1
You expected a 2 2?
Is this the final year?
Are you finished?Jeez.
That was quick.
Only two more months to go.
What kind of sleeping arrangement do you expect?
I mean you can stay here, but currently we just have spare sofas.
And like a trillion pillows.
WHAT
You are never mean to me.
I am playing a game and just showered.
What are you doing?
I want juice.
What is your favourite juice these days?
Set up a 4 assembly machine, 4 beacon thing.
But we seriously need a mod for faster inserters.
We used to have a mod that had like mk4-7 in everything.
Vegetables. We have some. But waiting for toka.
She is having iftar with people.
I woke up.
Awake.
HOW DO YOU FEEL
Are you still a mean person?
I feel pretty good for a morning.
I am glad you are finished.
Does anything else annoy you now?
What do you want?
MAKING BIG DOUGH IN STARDEW
Let me finish this day in stardew.
You never get a break.
ARE YOU FINE
I want spring rolls
When do you want to?
I can.
Now?
What happened.
I went to shave.
I did the dishes and cleaned the oil pan.
And now, I will really make food.
Did the ants kill you?
I am going to go shower.
I hope we talk 100 times more now that you are free.
Toka is still not home and I am still hungry.
Where are you.
I will cook them now.
Yeah, I mean she had iftar already.
I have not eaten for 12 hours or so.
Okay now I am really making them.
Are you going now?
Wake up.
But this one you must.
Morning.
Good morning.
We had a no internet day today.
We went shopping and got new towels, and dishes for the cats.
And cycling.
But when will you talk to me?
I have internet all day at work.
Wake up.
Come in mariam.
On Monday I will be having iftar here.
What do you want for dinner tonight?
Fattah?
Who knows.
Pasta tonight.
When will you be home?
I do not know if you listen to everything I send.
Have you made 1 million gold yet?
Today is a deadline.
My work depends on other people.
I was told about it three days ago.
I told those people I need these things.
One thing I asked for two weeks ago.
Still, right now, the server side is not started.
Eslam is one of the people.
Magdy knows.
The magdsoft server was hacked again.
Jeez they seemed to have done nothing malicious other than take ownership of it.
I just tried exploiting it but I could not.
No he is trying to contact the provider.
I hope to leave in one hour.
Coming home now.
Hello MARIAM.
Are you back from the countryside yet?
Will you tell me everything you do with your freedom?
Is the Z-man there?
I had fattah.
Will you send you.
Where did all your colour go?
Hmmmm, let me see if I have a photo.
Where is your smile?
This is you right now?
You look like you need tom day.
I thought I lost crazy eyes but he is snoring in the middle of the kitchen.
Hey.
Is it food time?
What did you see.
It is my bed time.
I am so tired tonight.
Actually I might nap on the couch until toka gets home.
41 today.
Might leave early we are going to rohyme's flat.
I am now the server admin :D
I am managing 3 servers now.
Fadi managed to hack back into the main server with a security hole he caused.
35 at midnight.
I have 6 terminals all on different computers on my computer :D
5 servers.
Not including my own two.
Became the server admin at work.
Managing four new servers.
No just different work.
I am the only one who knows this stuff.
Are you sure? I thought it was more like 8 weeks.
Yeah 13 weeks.
I am fine.
The old server is completely recovered now so I guess he is in a better mood.
I am very hot and tired.
I am home.
When are you home.
What do you want?
Pasta?
When will you be home?
45 minutes.
I want pasta.
Hi.
Are you fine?
Hmmm, maybe I can set up conversations for it while riot does not have it.
Hmm no.
Let me check that issue about voice notes.
Nothing yet.
The cat was fucking around with wires.
sudo systemctl stop openvpn-client@brenda
Or reboot
Yeah it requires a microsoft account to vote.
Yeah.
Magdy seems to be in a good mood.
Are there still no mods for it?
I made him confirm on my calendar.
We are working tomorrow.
But have all next week off.
All.
I might wash them.
Probably vesectomised too.
Okay.
It should be 2 hours.
I am stareving.
How has he never seen a laser?
I have a week off work starting friday.
Hi.
I am coming home.
After tommorrow I get 8 days off.
So we are meeting, right, right?
After Eid.
You never stop moving.
COMINGWhat will we eat.Is it om mohammed night?What will we eat?COMING
COMING
Oh.
Now they send.
Looks like it is time to see how many bytes I can fit voice into again.
Those music and voice samples are insane.
I will never get a phone.
I do not like thme
BABY
6 HOURS UNTIL MY 8 DAY WEEKEND
Never really played gold and silver.
What is ultra sun and moon?
I liked fire red a lot.
Playing through stardew valley again with v1.2 and plenty of mods.
Addicted for a second time.
4 MORE HOURS
I really should.
Lazy to get it out though.
I have played about 4-5 games on the wii u.
I have so much potential.
Ages ago, or new?
Turns out I did not watch the new oddesey trailer.
The hat thing...................
What do we eat today.
I think it is home time.
WHO IS HOME
Hello.
Could you ask daddy if he wants to video chat anytime in the next week?
No, just to chat.
I will wash crazy eyes.
I have been fine.
Toka says hi and that we are waiting and excited.
One cat is stinky and the other is fighty.
Work is fine, I am some kind of idol there.
Yeah saturday is fine.
We thought car for way too long there.
No, we both thought you mean Daddy's car loves a laser light.
Yes?
As long as no sand.
As long as you do not take it near sand.
You want it tomorrow?
Do you have real monopoly?
I warn you, I am good at it.
You better read the instruction book because I ain't accepting any made up rules.
Message me tomorrow before we leave reminding me.
4pm I think.
gg down again.
chat
Btn seems weird with the h&rs.
WestWorld S01E01?
Yeah, I noticed, saving that one until I have seen all the trailers.
Yeah, performance is the problem.
I think I will have ext4 for the root, and nilfs for the home partition.
Since the home does not do much, and I want file versioning.
Oh wait, the 2016 benchmark I found was a usb drive.
Did you win the exam today, statistically speaking?
Why am I not using this?
It must be slow or something. It must have something wrong.
At least with hdds it seems like it must be performance. It lacks a lot in areas.
That was from 2009, never mind.
Jesus, time to drop a family member.
From now on we only speak in a secret code that changes on a random day each week.
A retard spy.
You can figure it out.
Good morning Mariam.
Which part of it?
I really fell in love with the 'This Is Why I Need You' song.
custom settings
Shoot w/o lens
See that spanner with the big C?
In that menu at the bottom.
Yeah go up until you see shoot w/o lens.
I am.
I finished.
Where are you.
Did you draw anything today?
Press the up button to change which setting you are on.
There are more than one setting in the custom menu.
Reinstalled arch just for kicks.
Installed it using lvm.
Thinking about creating volumes for my home folders, and sticking unimportant stuff on the hdd.
Same.
nilfs is log based, so it always appends changes. So any change is easy to revert.
Unless I write 120GiB, that change will be recoverable.
And I think I like that feature over the rather significant performance loss.
Aparrently it works really well with small files on ssds performance wise, but sequential it is about 50% on hdds.
Sequential hdd would make sense because the file is fragmented as fuck.
Left my root on ext4 so it does not matter.
When will you arrive?
It was quite an epic.
I have been listening to the playlist of him since.
A little sleepy.
How are you?
I am writing in C again.
When I have to depend on C libraries, I think I am forced to.
Jesus.
I have not seen a cyan color in my terminal in forever.
No. But where is your visit.
My mum and sister are coming in 3 months.
50p
35p, sorry.
To be fair though, they are 15 minutes of my labour time, and 15 minutes of yours is more than that in grapes.
"Flying people carriers"
Wrong person.
"Flying people carriers"
What is reserve?
I now manage 5 servers at work :D
You should replace your windows with this.
Sorry second link is legit.
Do you see the guy over the! , he is very quiet
*there

I need to go to the Laundromat.
The German Laundromat?
I want to know a lot of information about animals; I think I can find some in the laundry.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Some what?
Cairo.
Cairo.

Android development.
Hi.
It is so hot.
They are open.
Hi.
Today we cycled and had roast vegetables.
But toka just left to go on a trip.
So I have three days alone.
I have been reinstalling stuff.
Will you send you.
But a happy colorful you.
Would you cycle by yourself?
You did a self-portrait?
Are you drawing in color?
My breath and hands can not stop smelling of onion.
You are tracing?
You look like you are annotating some alien xray.
Come back.
Did you get on the bus?
My insides and outsides stink of onion.
My farts would have killed you tonight.

I took the computer to bed.
Toka would go crazy if she knew.
I have the monitor turned sideways and the keyboard on top of me.
Good morning.
Are you well fed and watered?
Are you well slept?
I just woke up.
Hey
Are you covered in bruises from cycling?
Does everyone think I am abusive?
I slept at 5am and woke up at 11:30am.
Just made coffee.
One last partition resize that will take 8 hours.
**12 hours.
One for the pi, one for the camera.
16GiB really is not enough though.
I have another 2TiB on the pc.
Not a fruit.
Are you fine?
A breakfast.
Not heard anything since the poor build quality launch problems.
4TiB external. Which makes me consider a partition, but having the pc half functional.
Is it even usb3
Plastic screen was the worst thing. It was getting scratched by the stand.
Is using an external hdd possible?
Yeah, I still have a storage issue then.
She has no computer so all her stuff. Mostly photos and music I think.
But the biscuits are safe?
:( fuck ants.
Hmmmmmm.
I do not know, but not soon.
Grapes and coffee.
I have a storage issue.
My 64GiB sd card is in the 3ds, my 32 GiB is in toka's phone, and after that I just have a 16, 4, and 1.
WINTER FINISHED
Change of plan: samboosa.
Are you alive and fine?
No message from nada.
Stuck with no alt key until the resize is finished.
Just got my 3ds updated. Might try the wii now.
The only game I have on there is xenoblades because I had to delete everything to make room for it.
Uh oh, when does the internet run out?
There is a new feature in the custom firmware on the 3DS that lets you use input from your pc to the 3DS.
Could make monster hunter a lot more playable.
I hate the camera control in it.
But also, I think the screen is too small to be using other input.
Yeah, but I fucking hate that thing.
It hurts to use, and barely works.
Downloading ever oasis.
Know nothing about it but that you have to make an oasis.
And that reminds me of that stuffed animal game on the xbox.
Right, no microsd adapter, so 1GiB better suffice for this hack.
Time to see how outdate my wii u system is.
5.5.1
Hahahaha, no updates.
It is recommended to update before hacking.
No idea, following *the* guide.
Might have to leave this until thursday.
The 1GiB seems to be fucked.
OKAY I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO CHANGING MY KEYBOARD LAYOUT TO THE SAME SYSTEM AS ALL THE OTHER ONES AND NOW MY ALT KEY WORKS
I really want to play it now.
I have seen almost nothing of it so that I can feel wonder when I do.
My adapter I can not get until next friday.
I might buy a new sd card.
Also, mohammed's mum switched the broom handle with the brush handle.
PHEW
I woke up.
Should I have sambousa again?
It is hard not to sleep at the same time.
One that I like.
I updated the 3DS and got a new nice game.
It is about creating an oasis in the desert.
hello
Hi.
I am good.
How are you?
They are fine too.
I am wondering what to eat today though.
And I woke up at 3pm.
What are you doing.
What do I eat.
I redesigned the cat eating/drinking station to hopefull cause less mess and easier to clean up ing ness.
It is not possible when I have work.
And when toka is around I would never dream of staying up so late.
I am not even able to.
Nada has my camera, and toka has the phone.
I have that too, and the other biscuits.
I prefer the not ka7k ones though.
There is no selection of biscuits here.
They are not the best, but they are edible.
I don
I do not see anywhere on the site with that.
Seems like a really bad site.
I would read the terms and conditions.
When are you home.
Hi, wake up.
The terms of conditions does not seem to mention the preflight details.
However, do lycafly actually operate aeroplanes?
They look like a middle man to me.
Also only has one rating and a rating of 1 on glassdoor.
How are you?
You are awake before me?
Is it nouveau bianche?
Are you managing?
Are you alive.
Hi.
What?
Hello
hello
Hello.
Come back.
Time for coffee and drumstep and go.
Minimal wires, no more falling down speaker wire, hidden computer and router.
Oh, an no more moving sofa.
Did you sleep on the keyboard?
I am trying to add read receipts to mm.
YES?
Hello
Hey
hello
Hey
Hey

Hello
TEST
Hello
Okay well, I have not done read receipts. But I did rewrite mm. This time in a total of 165 lines.
I am missing sending read receipts though.
Hey
Oh wow, a 44% turn out rate in the french parlimentary elections.
Ever oasis is pretty balling.
Can not comment on that yet.
The program I talk here with.
Have an A1 day!
Are you trying to download all of them?
Flash drives break all the time.
Well, sort of clean.
Give them to me next time we meet and I will check them.
Why?
Oh you are nada.
I got confused.
Nada says she might pass by.
What time?
Come at 5:20 and you can help me take the cat to the vet for a shot.
Who looks after them?
Izzy pop?
Are you here.
This sounds peruvian.
Hey, I was suprisingly close.
Good morning.
A food.
I am.
Because there was an IRC client in a similar spirit called ii.
And this is a minimalistic matrix client.
The source title is actually a joke.
# mm (19311931)
I am hoping toka brings home bread.
I like fool and babaganough and ta3meya and bread and bitengen.
This is british egyptian.
I am writing typing notifications now.
Whoops.
I have made a mistake.
Bare with me.
I have no idea.
I think I found the bug.
Okay I think that hell may be over.
hey how are you? o e 
Hey are you fine?
MARIAM, come in.
I now send typing notifications!
Does this improve your life?
Added typing notifications to my matrix client.
Actually, I rewrote it, and it is missing read receipts right now.
Okay but I still have not written read receipts.
I am planning on making them real this time.
Are you learning three things in one day?
Before they just said I read everything if the computer received them.
I never liked classical.
Hey you should try a tom day song.
Or keith kennif.
I am looking.
Maybe.
Finding sheet music for goldmund is very hard.
I really liked learning ludovico einaudi music.
I might have to go get bread.
Toka is still not home.
And I have not eaten today :(
The bakery is still shut :(
Yes?
Yay you.
Yaou.
It is pissing me off that youtube is recommending me videos based on mutliple days worth of viewing history.
With no account, a vpn, and no cookies.
Are they fingerprinting me?
I am home.
No one phoned the home phone?
Nope. 
100% based on my history.
Mmm, "by using our services you agree to these terms".
Most bullshit shit ever shat out.
She has been with her friends a lot, but she has data and credit.
Apart from an hour ago to go get bread, I have been here the whole time.
And yesterday I was re-arranging the living room so the phone was disconnected for a few hours.
When did she phone?
I would not think so, it is every second week.
Did we come last week?
The bakery is still not open, Nada.
How am I meant to live like this?
Also the shop guy told me bookra meya meya and I just looked at him.
I have 8 packs left here.
I am not sure. I have not seen here in four days.
I do not recognise them.
All the photos have been re-arranged a long time ago.
You will have to wait until she is home.
She was meant to be home at like 6pm.
But egyptians.
Out of battery?
She went on a trip to the Sinai dessert.
Do you want to try and phone her again.
Did you see gg have a new way of rating users? SS. And we rank badly.
Recommended has broadband so might have multiplayer.
Probably not today though.
What makes it big?
I was never a fan of zelda dungeons.
But if it feels like tes kind of big.
I hope it is not bad on the wii u.
650MiB downloaded so far.
But on the switch...
Going to look up a performance review.
You told me the strap quality is balls.
Right, I have a 32GiB samsung pro to go.
It has a write speed of 65MiB/s which wow, I never realised.
Turns out I already owned brain training. I assume from that nintendo humble bundle.
Okay, hacked, now to figure out how to install things.
I would never have bought that game.
The brain training.
I heard if you put them back in reverse they never come out.
What do they use?
Are you sure?
I want everything to be a suprise.
1.5GiB so far.
I should get to play it tomorrow after work.
I mean, I have seen only a few screenshot.
s
I am going blind.
I read some text on it.
It seems like it should be fine.
02520348 & 623053
Finally got in.
Also, could you send me a photo of the stuff I left in the room?
Tempted to get a mini itx am4 board for ryzen.
Or just a mini-itx/stx.
Not sure if amd are going to let me do that though.
And stx would be iris only.
Seems to be a lack of small brotherboards though.
8.1GiB
Is he alive...?
Phew.
Are you taking it to the vet today?
BABY
Could you run a command for me?
`cd ~/.go/src/gitlab.com/meutraa/mm; git add . ; git commit -m "remove empty switch"; git push origin three`
Yeah, and enter.
meutraa
dish expansive climatic greedy demeaning fervor flavoring
middle click after selecting this to paste it.
Also, if you could paste the output of `cat ~/.local/bin/message` here
Yeah.
Got it :D
Did the move on your phone finish?
BABY.
Okay I think mm is working now.
Oh, it was the mm message I sent and then realised I needed the new code so used riot and sent babay again.
Not yet.
But water.
Could you paste `cat ~/.local/bin/mm-watcher`
Or `cat ~/.go/src/gitlab.com/meutraa/mm-watcher/mm-watcher.go`
Thanks.
Oh I am so psyched to play it tonight.
What song?
It is the alarm we set yesterday I think.
:D
On tab three, it is still downloading.
What progress is it at?
Hmmm.
One of the windows is showing a size.
What is the size?
`cd ~/wiiu/FunKii-UI/install; watch du -sh`
I think it failed.
in the window that said fatal IO error
press up, press enter.
a gui should appear
At this point you will have to send me a photo of it.
Jesus that is small.
the selection box
scroll to Breath of the wild EUR 
And photo it.
Near the bottom
The order is weird.
Try The Legend of Zelda: breath of the wild
I remember it is near the bottom.
GAME
EUR
Yeah.
Now download.
Yeah, it should take a while to check before it start downloading again.
And it just ended?
The base game is that big.
Did you select to download the dlc and updates when you clicked download?
I mean, when you click download, did you get a prompt for it?
Yeah, do it again but press yes.
Because it has them.
Did it get past the first 130?
Okay good.
I think it is another 2GiB.
Do you have enough space?
Wait what are you doing?
Is it slow?
Did the storage screen show that the lexar card was empty?
And the files you are transferring, where are you transferring them to?
And is it slow?
Okay.
Nope.
DID IT FINISH
It is time.
Yeah, actually still waiting for the dlc.
The internet drops and the application does not resume.
Happened last night too.
I do not think much is left, it has downloaded 13GiB already.
Want to call when I am ready?
I am sweating balls.
The cars are manic and I give the finger to everyone who breaks rules.
But suprisingly easy to cycle with.
No one cuts you off or gives you little room.
Which is suprising given every cyclist here is a kid cycling into ongoing traffic.
Who knows.
I think so.
I better start doing the wank gesture.
Okay, food and water.
Last file at 830MiB.
Oh, interesting, a twm for wayland.
Rust is pretty interesting but my experience compiling it is a fucking shit show.
Do you have the onion farts.
It always fails and pulls in a billion failing dependencies.
With go you just write go get github.com/meutraa/mm
The go program is one of the main reasons I like go so much.
Cargo is just fucking painful.
This gif is still loading.
Also, what happened in it?
Yeah hard to see the 90 turn.
I forgot what the new pound coin looks like.
Not round, right?
Remember my two pound coin balance in the conference room?
I will probably call in ten minutes; I am bored of waiting.
Baby.
Yeah, download JUST finished.
I am :D
Super excited.
And yesterday.
When are you home.
Mariam.
I miss you too.
Me too.
Nice :D
Trying to decide what computer parts to order.
I will see the photos when I get home.
Is it pasta night,
I am hungry.
But almost home time.
It is time.
no
I feel like I am onion.
nilfs has saved my ass so many times already.
Accidentally removing a file or moving to a name that already exists, etc.
What is a time sink?
Oh, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.
time sink alert, jeez spoiler.
It is so so soso sososososososososososo hot.
Did they worry?
Pretty sure there is more than that.
Like where is my mario cube full of stuff?
It is plaaaaaaaaay time :D
Both restart the browser.
Change the username.
Did you break your device?
I do not hear you.
WHAT
HURRY BEFORE THE FOOD BURNS
That last time i crashed.
I think there is a bug with some codec library.
Because for the last week I have been getting crashes on videos every second time.
And the call too.
I tried reverting firefox and the same thing.
I will turn the heat off but tell me when you leave and when you will be home.
Can not hear you.
Are you leaving soon?
You should have blamed it on travelling.
I will check now.
Yeah it went in today.
Oooh an ssd.
What no.
I had fool when I got home.
I can wait.
Ba7777777775hbk
Could you phone toka and find out where she is?
But how far away.
She was meant to finish work 2.75 hours ago.
If she just left tagoma, how is that 10 minutes away.
Horses are great, what are you on about?
The only problem I have is it is easier to pass by stuff unnoticed.
Fourth person here :D
Good morning.
Hey, check the message section in the mouse menu :D
OH I DID I DID
BACK ON TRACK
Are you fine now?
Whoa Mariam, getting a little exclamy there.
I am fine. 
Super hot though.
What did you do today?
What are you doing in general?
When will we meet again.
Working, eating, playing games.
Typing, coding.
Everything usual.
You should know.
I unplugged the phone to charge the gamepad.
The electric or something man came and it was 16.
Yeah.
We missed the water guy though.
No idea about dinner.
No eggplants or peppers.
When should you be home?
Bring tissues.
And orange juice.
We still need peppers though.
Hard.
Hello Mariam.
All I want to do is play zelda now.
I think I went the wrong way.
Ended up going to zora and just about at lylel now.
Being a server administrator is the best job.
I am home when are you home.
Jeez, alexandria is 30C right now.
And aswan is 46C.
No wonder people live on the coast.
There is a place in saudi at 48C right now.
Why were they playing music aslan?
Is your adsl fine now?
Does she know how to tell the difference between dogs that will hurt her and not?
Because almost all dogs in public will hurt her.
Pets are always a mistake.
I have had pets forever.
And always regret them.
though
Where is the water.
This is from beauty and the beast?
In our taps.
Just got the basic upgrades for the slate.
I can not wash or clean the dishes.
Or shower.
Wait, which thing did you say you spent ages on?
I got stuck on a trail.
One with two cubes.
One you could hit three things and they would rotate.
It pissed me off so much.
I just left.
It seems like a puzzle that should not have made it through playtesting.
How am I meant to remember the names?
It had spikes like the do not step on the flowers quest.
How can I know.
Why.
Thinking about it stresses me out.
Did you discover the one where you use motion controls and a maze with a ball?
Did you use cheese?
You can turn the controller upside down.
Good morning.
Morrrrrrrrrrrning.
Viper.
Or Venom.
Or Viscious fucks.
She should phone, not email.
Especially for one days notice.
Email is not reliable and has no verification.
If you email a change in plans, and there is no response, you can assume they will use the old plan.
I am going to write anything we should get this month here as a reminder when I get home.
Drying rack.
Pants.
Drain cleaner.
Because of the schedule change?
Did they not pay you correctly?
I am not being paid until saturday.
I washed crazy eyes.
Oh wow you did the dishes.
At least it is not a waste of time.
The cat is stinking everything with its wetness.
Yeah, just before I fell asleep.
Give me a time when you are home and I will have roast vegetables ready.
How I feel when you give me guavas.
Well he can not come until you are home from work with pay.
He came.
MORING
Want to hangout today?
I will just have breakfast and then call.
What?
Which devices?
You have one guess.
Waiting for a second fool to defrost.
That one was too small.
Hi.
I am good.
Going to fiddle on riot.
riot.lost.host
Should load 3 times faster for you without cache.
And pretty much instantly anytime in the following year.
Confirm so I can stop the other address.
Could I get you to open some ports on the router?
Actually, never mind.
ping riot.lost.host
What is the address?
What is the address?
Ah yes, I see blank.
I fucked up editing the config file.
Should be fine now.
Also, this dropped in price more than I ever expected.
At this point I say cache.
Try in a private window.
Oh yeah.
What the hell.
Pretty sure it is cache. When I try in private it does not work, but if I hard disable cache, it works.
The riot web guide has a security note recommending not running it on the same server as your matrix server.
And this server is much faster any way.
All communication is still send straight through lost.host
Just riot.lost.host loads the webclient.
What are they doing?
Do you have food?
Why are you not in a cafe with me?
I only know one of your friends.
You could have just cleared cache for the last 10 minutes or so.
They are finally working on a go matrix server.
I fucking hate having 60 python libraries installed.
Because games and programming sound fun.
Not dirty desserts.
What?
If clearing cache, how many websites did you get for cache in the last ten minutes?
I notice messages take a lot longer to send.
Zelda.
Ever oasis.
Which is odd because my terminal client does not take 30s.
Or a minute, jesus.
Actually, I think my connection is fucked.
Zelda and ever oasis.
REDACTED
Gary asked me what games I have been playing and I replied to you.
Yeah, hacked the wii u and downloaded it.
It is great.
Only 30 hours in or so.
Who are your closest ones?
Okay so I am not missing any.
I am super hungry.
But toka is still not home from work.
Can you ask toka where she is?
Toka finally came home.
And almost have dinner ready.
Why will you not sleep?
Goron City I found.
Not sure if that was it.
Balls if that is a city though.
Can I have a hint about why I need money?
I discovered all the areas bar the one north of the wastelands.
How expensive?
So I am thinking of buying a new computer.
But the parts I want are a bit expensive.
Well, I am getting a new one so all the parts are better.
It would be a case of giving you money when you come here.
Maybe instead of buying egp for the trip.
Comes to 800gbp total.
Going to hold off and hope the price comes down a bit.
Think I have 610 in the bank.
Decided on blowing my money on the m2 pro 960 500GB.
If you hear of anything new in the next two months, give me a heads up.
I am fine. Almost finished work.
I am super hungry.
We went shopping.
She stays up to 3am too?
Good morning.
Oh wow.
Doing what?
A summer class for what?
Are you talking about special K all night?
Baby, coming home now.
Guess who got another 4500 today :D
He said I was one of the only people who deserves my salary haha.
OH I HAD NO BREAKFAST THIS MORNING
When are you home today.
I am home. Wake up.
Hangout in 15 minutes?
WHEN
I discovered the whole map.
Found a second great fairy.
Also, have you done the fountain of power?
North of the wastelands.
Not sure what it is called.
38 shrines now.
Might be free tonight.
Not sure what I will do yet.
Not far enough in.
40 hours I estimate.
I will probably try and find most of the shrines before googling stuff.
Are you awake yet.
I am awake too late.
There are dogs on roofs and I want to kill people.
Guess who got paid 4500 this month :D
What is a good puzzle game?
A real life game or a computer game?
Hmmmm.
Yeah.
I have no idea of any names.
But I played a few good ones.
I get bored of puzzles though.
Are you visiting before next friday?
Baaaaby.
I am home.
How does that work?
I am sure you can find it on the pirate bay.
I am transferring something from the server.
If you need internet now and you notice it is slow, just tell me.
Just tell me when. I need the file for work tomorrow and it is 13GiB.
It should take 3 hours total. But there is all night so tell me when you are home and I will pause it.
Did you like the pretzels?
I ate them all.
I did not want to finish them because they are toka's but she kept not hiding them.
Did you get the full climbing suit?
Oh wow. Same on both cases.
35m I think.
Not leveled all the peices to two star yet so no spoilers on the set bonus.
Off to do that now. I just need the electro keizos.
Where are the electro wings?
I guess the jungle.
Did you get the shrine in the jungle that is in a mound?
That is the spoiler.
You just told me it is not something cool.
Probably just faster climbing.
Yeah but I would have still had an hour of hope.
I really want fateer.
Did you notice pro UI mode in settings?
Gets rid of all the permenant hints on screen.
Never heard of it.
Are you home.
Guess who got a 200 bonus :D
Tell me if the internet is slow in the next two hours.
Like if you need it and it is slow.
Is it still unlimited?
Just generated a password that started with zGay1maN
Waiting for the day I get <zY34hG4yBoOo1I!I[sT
Mariam.
Hi.
I am going home now.
Yeah, I gave him the five hundred and he said, "paul", "yes?", "here, a bonus".
I guess because I gave the money back with no problem.
COMING HOME
It has been since cake decorating I think.
I am home now.
Marzipan plain?
I wonder if you put nuts inside if it would be better.
Something like hazelnuts.
I had chocolate coated peanuts this week and they were good.
Correct.
Remember the raw cocao beans?
Those covered in chocolate.
Pretty dangerous.
My grandad has slipped disks.
When are you home.
:/
They should have called it in work hours.
If you called them at 4am and told them to go somewhere, the correct response is fuck off.
No. Why would you think that.
HURRY.
The first level?
You should record you saying busted during a burp.
You should google how to.
MORNING
Oh god why.
You can send me photos.
I am just going home.
Will you paint it?
20,000?
Just a guess.
I still only have two.
Over 20,000 would be crazy.
The mira's power thing.
Does it work over and over?
Recharge...?
And does her spear break?
Never realised I would get rewarded for defeating it.
Now I want to go do the other four.
*three
HUNGRY
When are you home.
I had two rolls.
Did you have any?
I made some soup and fateer.
This song is very good.
That fateer tastes fresh.
Why are you not home.
I wonder how many registered hitlers there are in the UK.
Less than 3 in 2016.
Also, try botw with Japanese voice..
I found your cv and did some edits to it.
The left is my version.
Also, only ever send a cv as a pdf, with the file name as Resume-NadaAbdelKaderKhaled.pdf
Toka is wondering about your results.
I fixed so many formatting errors.
**toka**
WHERE ARE THE PHOTOS
When was the last time you cycled?
Does your driver cycle for you and you sit on the second seat?
I was sick today.
It was awful.
Qualified, .NET.
.NET is a shitty Microsoft only language.
The boss in divine beast vah naboris is unfair.
Is there even a way to dodge it.
The aim button fucks up 80% of the time and I have one one handed weapon.
And 7 hearts.
I get to about 20% health and I can not block any more because it makes me drop my weapons, also, I die, so the spirit thing brings me back, then I pick up my we- no it one hits me again, pick up? no one hits me, game over.
The last part where you can not dodge or block is just bullshit.
What the hell.
Oh mmm food.
The zoro one was easy, you just kept shooting it in the face with arrows.
Down is whistle, rb is throw.
Getting past the guards was easy, but the last room left me puzzled for ages.
Of yiga hangout.
No, the metallic dor.
At least twenty minutes.
Trying to get enough hearts to get the sword from the forest now.
I really had no problem.
Went up to the banana room.
Jumped down to the end part,
jumped out for a second, ran around the other way.
I agree that the design of the rooms was bad.
But I had no problem going around getting all the items.
Also, their vision cones do not extend vertically.
Jesus.
Are you finished are you coming home.
What do you want?
I am hungry too.
I agree.
When will you be home?
No, when will you be home.
Can you ask daddy if he wants to video chat today or tomorrow?
No that is too early.
Toka is not home and we have to have to make dinner.
Still the first level?
Apparently the latest version of it has multiplayer.
In 1.5 hours would be fine.
The photo is a bit small.
You should take the outfit to egypt with you.
I start shivering at 23.
Is there a person dressed up as a door in the middle of that stage?
mmmm game of thrones.
Download the image called nada-ahmed-wedding-index.png first.
Also, tell your torrent client to not download any files.
Then individually select the ones you want and set a high priority.
riot.lost.host on the pc
get a torrent client
Like qbittorrent.
And open that file with it.
Are you having a laugh?
Send me a bigger photo.
That is tiny.
You did not open the file I sent.
riot.lost.host
Actually, hold on, did it find any peers?
Also I said to download qbittorrent.
utorrent deserves zero trust.
They shipped malware with their software at some point.
utorrent got banned from most private trackers.
utorrent bad, infect computer.
delete utorrent
download qbittorrent
install qbittorrent
open this file.
64-bit installer
Probably.
What link?
exit
Go to the tracker tab.
right click, add new tracker
(just finding a working tracker)
In the tracker list, jesus.
Are you 105?
Right click everywhere until you see add new tracker then.
How much effort is that?
There are two main lists, the bottom one.
When you clicked the tracker tab, only one thing changed.
That thing that changed is clearly the tracker section.
No.
Add it as the tracker.
It is not a website.
It is a tracker.
I am not going to start explaining the concept of tabs and lists to you.
There is nothing unintuitive about this.
Do you want me to tell you how to right click a mouse too?
->>>>
There?
This is text, not fingerchat.
Show me.
You have not opened the torrent.
Okay now click content
Untick the folder at the top.
Tick the nada-ahmed thing.
Once it is finished, open it.
You have no torrent again.
I did not tell you to remove the torrent.
You just sent me a video with no torrents.
Did it send late or something?
Untick the folder.
Click name to reverse sort.
Tick nada-ahmed-wedding-index.png
Are you tripping,
Untick the folder.
You have done the literal opposite to what I said.
Click select none.
Make sure that index file is the only thing ticked.
I hate windows so much.
Try selecting all the files not index, right click, set priority, not download.
How verbose do I have to be with you?
But the index is ticked?
nada-ahmed-wedding-index.png
Tick it.
Then when it is downloaded, open it.
Crazy eyes is getting shaved and ball wire cut right now.
Yeah, she took a taxi, the fan installing man is still here.
I think it will still have some hair on the top.
I think they can fix the knots there.
Living room fan is going to be glorious.
Cool computer time :D
..., you can get the full version with a torrent.
Copy that.
Sure.
Just be careful, it is public, and anyone can upload stuff.
I would only download things by VIP or Trusted uploaders. Green and purple skulls next to the usernames, respectively.
Well, I would not download anything from a public tracker.
Can you tell toka to phone me?
Did you see the index file?
Just figure out the number of the image you want, then tick that image.
... open it.
Look at it.
Tell toka to phone me again?
Text message,
?
Is there anyone else that can phone her?
It is pretty urgent.
Install 7zip
Toka was crying after the operation.
16.04 (not beta), .msi 64 bit.
Castration.
Because he is heavily drugged.
yea we did it
He is trying to stand up now.
It has been about 3 hours since.
Going to limit your download speed a little, it is killing our internet now we are home.
Remind me to set it unlimited later though.
Never used it though.
Baaaaby.
What is 100%?
Of the photos you selected?
Jesus.
You can not come earlier than around 5:20.
No one will be there.
And I have to leave for the vet at 5:40 exactly.
Hard mode of what?
Yeah I know.
The kitchen is still not clean.
No idea what hard mode is.
Magdy is in the Minia branch.
And he just messaged me super excited.
No...?
Good morning.
Where is your cycling video?
What does?
I asked mummy if the internet was still unlimited, before I transferred quite a bit of data.
She said she did not know.
Mummy has never mentioned changing bandwidth packages.
If you mean your laptop says "connected with limited access", then the router has not connected to the internet.
But I can connect to the server, and we are talking, so I guess not.
Can you phone the vet and ask if the injections were included in the procedure cost?
I need a pump tonight.
I had to walk home.
If your brother has a bike pump, please come tonight.
Or I will be walking to work.
You do not talk to him? I do not talk to him
I am back.
They tried lecturing me on the collar and I effectively told them to fuck off; 65 is extorsion.
Would it not be awful if your cat got very ill, they need this, oh we happen to sell this, 65.
That shop is robbery.
hundreds for some scented stones.
That last one is cheaper and has padded fabric on it.
A velcro fabric one.
You can even get a coat collar for cheaper.
Those ones with rubber cost no more than 2.5usd.
The litter.
I hate that shop so much.
No.
Have you ever seen that cat lick itself?
They looked at the balls and tried to blame not having a collar for it.
The reason the area is dirty because the cat is messy and never licks itself.
No.
Also, can they not just give us the medicine, and we can buy two needles?
Do they realise how inconvinient it is for us to go there for 30s each day?
Yes.
I need a pump.
My wheels are flat.
No.
Can you put out a national broadcast for one?
That it is a schrader valve.
Why is my pump not working though?
The type of valve I have.
Let me try one last time.
The pump is for both types.
And I can deflate the tyre.
I did a hack.
I stuck a small stone in the pump and it works.
The stone has to be the right shape, and some are too soft they break.
Pretty sure the pump is broken.
But if I can find the right shape metal thing, it can work.
Could you see if you could take the cat earlier tommorrow, and by taxi?
By the way, almost all cars use schrader valves.
So every person who said no yesterday was an idiot.
Before work earlier than 6pm.
This is my tire.
Actually, mine is not there, it is the 25mm version, that starts at 32mm. But it is the same model.
I adjusted my brake wires and tightnesses.
Okay time for food.
I just get angry.
I found a way to make the pump work.
It is weird how I notice you looking older and older.
Were you stranded at sea?
Did you send your family swimming with the fishes?
What?
With what?
Do you want to put 79?
I think you should, it is a high grade, but I also know no educational body here knows how to grade or the purpose of grading.
When you have people scoring 95+% you have fucked up.
I would not work for almaqarr.
I feel like as soon as you start Abdelqader will have some weird type of control over you.
And will actually exercise it.
For a while.
I would not accept anything other than him believing it.
I would hate them until that.
Believing that it is genetic.
Yeah, I would hate him until I thought that he no longer thought like that.
It is just stupidity.
Well, he will not consider it a loop hole.
Solid theories do not have loop holes.
Yeah Toka mentioned it.
I tend to get angry and then just leave and ignore it.
And then continue to ignore it for the rest of time.
But angry if they bring it up.
A simple reinforcement training.
What email?
Pfft, you have plenty of time to find something.
You have your parents to sponge off of.
My company never replied to me.
Toka phoned them up asking, and then they phoned me for an interview.
They just never pay much attention to their email.
I think always phone to start, then email the deets.
Oh.
Toka is asking about Axeer.
Toka says not to accept almaqaar until the last moments.
Yeah you need to come around for the photos.
I might be home at 5:30 tomorrow.
Toka might take the cat to the vet earlier.
Yeah, but for three days.
*xe
Okay good they can not judge you anymore.
I guess they will answer around midday.
Could you send me my soundcloud password?
`heavily vanquish sudoku self chatter enrage impart`
press control + y to paste it into the bar menu
you have to copy the password first.
riot.lost.host
It only works in the password menu.
Or just press alt + (my m key), type toka, press enter, control + y, enter.
Wait no.
After getting the password.
Thank you.
Take a taxi?
Or the bus.
Bus then.
Oh wow that was quick.
How was it?
Again.
Did they comment on the cone?
stitches.
They do have incisions.
they singular
Have you met the female before?
Yeah.
Ameny's dad came in today.
I think magdy is still in Minya.
Cheap labour.
Buildings are actually 20% more, and the rest of everything is about 40% cheaper.
He makes money on interns anyway.
From what I hear, there are a severe lack of any devoloper jobs outside cairo.
It is 2017.
Hello.
Are you fine?
Did you paint anything?
You are home?
I finally managed to pump up my bicycle wheels and cycling is nice again.
It is 7km a day I do.
I think I am feeling back to normal now.
Our cleaner/cook has been on holiday for around 3 years now.
Are you coming today?
Baaaby, I am home.
The bike is so much faster :D
Another two months.
And mum.
Are you Pam?
From the office.
No, she thinks she is not coming today.
Yes.
Also, not really tonight.
Practically tomorrow.
Did you notice frozen bread sticks are perfect?
They are just slightly colder bread sticks, nothing frozen about them.
I really want to finish botw so I can see that speedrun.
I wonder what my hourage is now.
When are you finished.
For the first hour here it is just me and 1 or two other people.
Everyone is late.
We still have the drops.
:( I have to take the cat.
I might remake the cone so it does not look so wet or dirty.
The hardware could be broken.
Yeah, it is dodgy.
I think.
A few of my SD cards are iffy.
What?
Because it was all I had.
When are you home?
I am leaving for the vet now.
KHALAAAAAAAAAAS
Yes.
WHEN ARE YOU HOOOOOOOOOME
Game of thrones..................
One hour until the "catch up".
Then the episode in 1080p at 10pm.
Did you forget.
Should I have the fateer?
Yes.
THERE ARE ZERO DISADVANTAGES AND MULTIPLE ADVANTAGES TO STORING ONES BREADSTICKS IN THE FREEZER. IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO DOES NOT DO THIS, COPY AND PASTE THIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TIMES OR THE SPIRIT OF UGLY BREADSTICKS WILL HAUNT YOU TONIGHT.
OoooOooOo
I will start processing them to jpeg.
You can take both sets.
Nada is coming over.
I will tell you one thing: I fucking hate mazes.
What kind of game is that?
It is just brute force or frustration.
What are you on about with ffs and ff9?
What...?
I made paul.lost.host and toka.lost.host, so we can both be signed into riot.
Was it good?
Anyone home to check the router?
I need to check a port.
Could you log into the router page?
An estimate?
Jesus.
What are you shopping for?
Used it for a while but it was too unreliable, I was using two linux machines and I ended up using a more basic reliable tool.
An old x tool.
Forgot what it was called.
Give it some time.
There are not many alternatives.
Just one I think.
It would just crash and die, and not auto restart the connection.
Both.
It was over a year ago.
Maybe bugs have been fixed.
Days though.
I assume both computers are on lan.
Because I tried wireless and it is not useable.
Actually, that was my hardware I think.
It would be 1ms, 1ms, 1ms, 200ms, 1ms kind of pattern.
Hmmmm
panasonic g something
Mirrorless micro four thirds.
I am busy for now.
Maybe the G3
G5 I think.
I have some time now.
COMING HOME
When are you home today.
What the fuck.
Did they fuck up her treatment completely and now the only option is chopping it off?
Did you just leave for work ...?
Now?
10 is so late.
Is she getting a fake foot?
She must.
Yeah, let me open it.
After fucking up her foot, why should she trust them not to fuck up the amputation?
It makes me angry.
The hospital being incompetent and leading to a 'oh well, best we can do now is get rid of it'.
The only time you need to chop off a foot is when you stand in a meat grinder, or on a mine.
Yeah, having trouble calling.
Yeah.
Failing to connect.
Can you call here?
Could you bring back some tablets for heart burn?
They are literally chalk, with some flavor so make sure they are not expensive.
Toka is not home yet.
But I had two mangoes, a cucumber, and fool.
They are here, and cheap :D
The cheapest.
10-12.
I think there are cheaper ones.
Did you go alone?
Have you traveled without your parents before?
Oh I remember.
How was your interview?
Are you finished.
Hmmm, I have heart burn.
And am very hot.
There is somebody watching.
The window pretending there is an outside.
Should she be touching things?
Why does he have no eyes?
This is called working for free, and is a bad start.
Fady is leaving too :O
Hello.
Nah, you are still on infinity unlimited for 32GBP excluding tax a month.
I might get a pay rise next week.
Magdy said he would make me a new offer and salary next week.
Maybe with fady and rohyme leaving he is scared he will lose me.
I am hoping the offer has nothing to do with minya. Which is why I said might.
Or anything managerial.
AH YES I NOTICED THIS MORNING
Dollars would be a nightware because I would have to go to the bank.
We have a hard enough time spending 200s.
Well, lisa mentioned something about limited connection last week so I was worried a bit.
What are you talking about?
Maybe ff9.
Did you do the Tenny Town quest?
I never noticed the upgrade animations.
Also, you can get the legendary weapons remade when they break.
Not sure how long I have played now but still only at 66 shrines.
Ah.
Gives him a blowjob for the final?
I think I have seen it but I tend to mash skip.
I have started collecting all the types.
Nowhere near that stage of the game yet.
Have you finished the game?
I have never went around farming materials.
I just upgrade what I can sometimes.
I should do the last giant monster thing today.
I think it is the only cross platform solution for that.
Bt now let you lease a line at 10,000Mb/s up and down for 240GBP a month.
Which is absolutely insane.
Do you know where the tweezers are?
Also WHAT DO I EAT
I think we have NOTHING
Yeah.
That speed is faster than almost all computers can handle.
It is downloading (and uploading at the same time), 1.25GiB a second.
A full HD movie in 4 seconds.
It is 80,000,000,000,000, 80 trillion bits of data a second.
I had some fool.
Getting a new salary offer next week.
Hoping it has nothing to do with the new office in a different city, and nothing to do with management.
I was told today that when he gets back from the other office.
Are you home.
When will she come,
It is the 200th FF on factorio tomorrow.
Yeah, do you want to go to the hospital instead?
Which trip was better?
Did you play demon's souls?
Which of the games have you played now?
Where are you.
Can the ps4 not play ps3 games?
Have you played ico?
Can the ps4 play any ps1 or 2 games?
Mariam hello I miss you.
The cheese cloth?
What are you talking about.
I feel like I never have context anymore.
I think we have talked about that before.
Similar process, but the outcome is barely comparable.
Let me check riot.
I like vegan cheese.
I guess they are not made the same either.
Yeah, riot has the message.
That is pretty cool though.
I imagine difficult to do well.
Pfft, just play the originals.
Come to think of it, I can use my vpn as a seedbox for music.
Do you know of any decent music trackers now?
gazelle based I suppose.
I am pretty swank at writing bash scripts these days, I could probably automate a lot of conversion stuff.
Which level is it?
Have I done it?
It becomes an issue when you overtake me.
Ah yeah, I think that is the one we completed, right?
I think so.
We drove a car to kill half the dancefloor.
And the vip section was hard.
Yeah, we totally did.
Why?
Why do you?
They are nice colours but they are not bright.
Okay, yes you look beautiful.
We went to see toka's grandmother in hospital, then we ordered some chinese food. I got Shang tong or something. It is battered kosa and it is delicious.
Other than being bright, what are you doing tonight?
Why is your wardrobe a mess?
Hi.
I am sleepy.
But I can try.
Hurry back from your shower.
Did you drown in your shower,
Did you drown in your shower?
Let us talk all day tomorrow.
The most we have ever talked.
I will go to bed now though.
Be here tomorrow or be square.
Okay wake up.
Does tofu go foosty?
Well, I hope so.
Apart from when the Zman steals you for the gym.
Or your dad forces you to take forks.
Or hla needs some stationary.
Or people want to interview you for secret exclusive clubs.
You have the largest history on riot with me.
I do not have all of it locally, but you have 44MiB, toka 32, and ben 22.
You can search the chat for hearts to find special times.
Wake up.
Hello.
I feel violated.
Hello.
There is a no work rule here.
You need an equally cool photo.
Thursday.
Cheese takes quite a white though.
Is Wednesday your last day?
Okay, I will try not to forget.
Not sure how relevant this knowledge is, but bread sticks, freeze them.
They taste the same straight out of the freezer, but fresh.
Which one?
Riot is better than what?
I used to run an XMPP server but it was ugly.
And then the Matrix protocol came out.
And Riot is a matrix client.
I have been very happy with matrix.
Also, iOS has zero decent xmpp applications.
But Riot is on iOS.
So my iOS friends could talk to me.
A little.
Refreshingly cold.
You would not think frozen though.
I think they must all be parts.
I am not sure though.
NO WORK
Jesus set a nickname on riot.
You are renting a roof?
You are moving in with people you know, right?
Hmmmmmmm.
They are 65p for a kilogram here.
I failed the master sword trail twice now, once at 6, once at 8.
It is bullshit.
I have three friends on here, and four family members.
I only lived with one indianish guy. He was an Indian Londener.
This is me as a pirate.
Obviously.
The cat keeps looking at all the windows like, "I tell you bro, I have seen the other side, I am not crazy, the stories are true".
I mean, I have the hearts, how deep is the trail though?
trial
"idiot proof"
WHERE ARE YOU
Okay hurry.
Dunst, got it.
Tell your driver to step on it.
I have done the shrines, and pulled out the sword.
But the "Trial of the Sword".
It has levels.
Will we voice chat today?
Oh.
Well I hate that trial.
Did you go in the basement of that labyrinth to the north east?
If you need guardian parts, go there.
I kind of feel like minecraft today.
Yes, lots.
How high do the stars go?
None then, I think I have most sets at 2, and the climbing at 3.
I have only played 60 hours so far.
I only have the champion tunic.
I have nothing at 4.
I do not have the champion head or bottoms.
What.
No.
I expected everything to be a set.
Tell me when you can.
I had my coffee.
What was that program I recommended for notifications?
I am off today, I worked thursday instead.
I have no idea. Eating and talking to you.
Maybe later I will play a game.
Do you have other plans for today?
Why do we not meet today?
Where did you go.
I had a mango.
Is that a no go on minecraft?
Oh wow.
HURRY WAKE UP
I had no idea.
Will we voice chat.
What are they playing?
It was also castrated.
Why does your landline never work?
How did you just send a video.
Why is it purple?
What will I do?
Yes.
I can not take videos though.
I would have to use toka's phone and she is not here.
You always disappear.
No body has been to our house in a long time.
But the cleaner and Nada.
Did you see our shaven cat?
It went to the groomer because it had matted hair.
Jesus, like I did not see that coming.
They can wait until they move out.
You get a puppy for half a year, then you get a dog for the next twenty years.
A dog that needs daily walks.
Today is very boring.
Oh no.
It is going to mega jump bite you, fall, break a leg, get pregnant, let two of its children die and be eaten, and bark the whole time.
How can your parents let that happen?
She could lose a hand or die.
No, they should be more protective here.
You can record it.
I am going to buy a new computer in the new month.
My mother will take it with her to Egypt.
Only a little.
I never saw them while I was at university.
Toka works too late.
I started learning Stenography.
The typing kind.
This kind.
Instead of pressing one key at a time, every word has a chord of keys.
Special steno keyboards are expensive though.
It takes years of studying.
Like 3-7 I think.
Maybe.
The plank keyboard I have waiting for me in Scotland have a steno mode built in.
I learnt to type 35 words so far.
Just a few more thousand to memorise.
Is it voice time yet.
Where did you go.
When are you home.
I made hot chocolate.
But it was too strong.
I am bored.
Nope.
I have a fan in the living room now.
Nope.
I want to see the view from your everything.
It looks a lot better than the view from my window.
It will still be over a year away.
Yeah.
And I would have to cycle 20km a day.
riot.lost.host is the correct address
I think there are buses that pass my work though.
Toka takes it every day.
Toka takes it every day.
Hangout with me.
I have no idea.
:(
This is riot.lost.host?
A riot webapp?
This is just chrome that can only go to one website.
riot.im?
I think I just want to nap.
Toka comes home too late.
It is too late to paint.
I am trying not to.
Because I said "jesus, set a nickname already".
Have you ever spoke to her here?
This was 15 years ago.
Are you interested in that?
He has not came in yet.
Where are those settlements though?
There is a trailer for westworld 2, and a teaser for stranger things 2.
I got a puncture in my front tire.
So I got Rohyme and we just went and patched it.
Hopefully it worked.
I think he might not bring it up today.
It is getting late.
Eugh, what a long day.
Oh wow, spoilers.
What is there moisturiser there for?
That trail of the swords has put me off everything.
More than the island challenge.
I am home now.
Not literally long.
Just problems.
Also the repair of the tire failed :(
I had to walk.
I will have to try again.
I will watch some videos about it first though.
LOVE YOU
Be home now.
One of the problems is that I do not know what is dlc.
And master mode?
I hate any time it prevents you from saving.
That is what drives me crazy.
Yeah.
I think there are a few more differences.
Floating islands.
All enemies are up one level type.
Rewards are higher.
900 korok seeds btw.
I am not sure I will get all shrines.
I think it is not a 97.
More like a 87.
So much of it seems like doing the same thing over and over, with a different landscape.
There is a lot of attention to the graphic design, but it is just pretty to look at and that is all.
Korok quests, there are like 6 types.
Shrines are just little mini puzzles, all with the exact same graphic theme.
Side quests are _usually_ really lacking. 
The 4 beasts are almost clones.
There are a handful of enemy outpost types.
A handful of enemy types.
Everything just seems too shallow.
But plentyful.
From where?
Oh jeez is today the first day?
Too many exams already.
I am just back from work so I will be playing after I relax.
Is that safe?
Is that the end of the story?
The bike worked.
Let him waste his money and a) conclude doctors are shit, b) nada is unfixable.
When are you home?
Good morning.
What?
2 more hours.
Or 1 at max speed.
Why.
Yes.
I believe everyone should be equal.
I do not make choices for other people.
I can disrespect my father for things, and respect him for other things.
What concern is his money to me?
When I become an adult and leave, I would not take his money.
And when he dies, I would give it to charities.
With disposable income comes more responsibilities to use it in an ethical way.
I think there should be a 100% inheritance tax on death.
Did I send you this one?
When are you home.
I am considering a bakery run.
Any idea where the tweezers are?
Indoor cats stink the whole house of poo.
Can you not call rspca or something?
Or animal control.
Or phone the council and tell them they attack you when you go outside.
Seagulls are endangered so you are not allowed to touch them.
I think these are them, and they are not endangered.
Actually, I take that back, Britain considers them at high risk.
I can not find my tweezers.
I use them all the time to pull hairs out of my chin.
I have been doing for about 10 years.
How do you not know this.
It is an obsession.
I get stressed when I have hair there.
I am waiting for toka to come home.
Did you like the first episode?
I found the tweezers.
Oh yeah, I thought you did it again.
And right now, I thought you really got arrested.
Because I read 'I got arrested first' and had no context.
No.
I think she should be finished work now though.
SPOILER
Yes.
Hmmm, I do not know her login details.
Why does here not work?
When?
I will start cooking.
I think I should start cooking.
I found them.
Kosa, bitengen, red pepper, yellow pepper, tomato sauce, vegetable stock, salt, pepper, garlic, sunflower oil in one pot.
Pasta in the other pot.
Tomorrow I find out I think.
What is dip and dip.
I watched the second episode.
But the first half was bad acting and the second half was just fighting.
Mostly deneras.
She is really bad.
BT now offer a leased 10Gb/s up, 10Gb/s down for 240GBP a month.
Pretty sure that is crazy.
Well, they have to install a line for you, so I imagine any exchange with fibre to it.
Are you using a map now?
That is what a leased line is, right?
10Gb/s, that is faster than probably 99.5% of people's computer ports, and who the hell has a 10Gb/s modem?
Weird how they do not offer anything between 96mb/s and 1000mb/s.
*10000
Yeah, it never used to have that and it was better.
But recacted images have their purpose.
Can you still edit posts?
Test
Tesh
Odd.
No need to request, this room is lawless.
BABY
COMING HOME
Hi.
I am home.
When are you home.
I am fine.
I will have fool.
Come watch the movie with me.
Are you working with Lina now?
***just do not take your children
Oh wow can no one keep a job.
Yeah.
There was so much shit with that island.
Half the island were jailed in a prison they had to build for them.
I imagine it would be easy to escape.
But then impossible to not be found.
Escape, rape a few little girls, go to prison.
I think the population rapidly declined at some point.
Well, the point were people stood up to the rape.
Did you forget to send a link?
Hahahahaha
It is paramount because.
The site has no certificate.
4 children ***away at school
Same sex couples are also welcome on Pitcairn and can legally marry.
Not much choice leads to experimenting?
$9464.00 a year expenses to live there.
The average Government income is NZ$6000 per annum.
Most community members supplement their government income by selling curios and souvenirs to visiting cruise ships and other visitors. Souvenirs range from wood carvings and handmade Jewelry to t shirts, caps and general Pitcairn memorabilia. Profits from this source might average from between US$ 6000 to US$10,000 per household. Its also an exciting and rewarding part of Pitcairn life.
These people sound like they are trapped.
You need 17,000GBP in savings to move there.
A fair estimate including importing all building materials and furnishings, and paying local contractors to build a 3 bedroom house, of around 125 to 160 square metres in size, might range from approximately NZ$70,000 to NZ$150,000.
However, land is free.
That does not seem cheap to me.
Yeah, but their incomes are around 7000GBP a year.
The labour costs should be much much lower.
I think if you go there people will have the attitude of giving up on life.
Or they are descendents of people who gave up.
Hmm I guess not that much.
Because they were all immigrants not that long ago.
Yeah, but that is only 3ish generations.
And the must come and go.
I imagine children grow up and want to leave asap.
The beginning of this I was looking into a mirror.
Almost.
But distractions.
Tomorrow, it must be.
I think he might want me to do android, iOS and the backend.
iOS, Android, and Php development.
And they host email.
Will you be fine with food?
Will you be starving when you get home?
No film.
What?
Yeah, I am waiting for you.
The one we did not finish.
HURRRRRRRRRRRRRY
Hi.
Yes.
I was making edits to mm.
But now it is bed time.
Is it fast, is it unlimited?
What will you do?
Why is it possible for her to contact you?
She did betray you.
I have pooed five times today.
And peed six.
Good morning.
I do not like thermodynamics that much.
:`
THREE MORE HOURS
He wants this branch to be a senior branch, and he will open another two branches next year.
So he wants me to learn iOS too.
Which is fine.
He will discuss my salary next week after I have spoke with Eslam.
Yeah, to program with it, but also so I can train other people.
Why did you take it aslan then?
Will you pass it?
15 MINUTES
I AM HOME
What will I do?
Are you coming home before going out?
I am free for the weekend.
Do you need anything?
Will you meet me tomorrow.
Waiting for fool to cool is too cruel for a drool mule, ya gruel pool.

Open the room settings, disable notifications, enable them again.
Come back.
Yeah, he wants me to do what I thought.
Why is Deus Ex: HR 16GiB on the wii U?
And why is bayonetta 2 15GiB?
I imagine it has a lot of these.
Security is not exactly their aim.
Minecraft viruses.

Are you fine.
Where are you.
The cat is sleeping on my keyboard.
Why :(
I had a dream you said no.
Meeting me today.
Good morning.
Yeah my dream was you did not want to.
What do I do today.
I just woke up after 11 hours.
What no.
Painting walls is the worst.
And I am the worst at painting.
I was good at oil pastel, and pencil.
What is for breakfast.
I think there is only mango.
Moorrring.
But soon.
What do you want for dinner?
Minecraft today?
No, just started moving the files to the other server.

Just spent the last of my money on water :(

How soon?
Should I start the game?
Mariam, hi.
Notifications are iffy on all mobile devices.
What kind of jar is this?
What is in it?
Here.
Hi.
WHAT IS IN THE JAR MARIAM
I have pineapple juice.
Why did you open the jar?!
Is that how mariam began?
I will go to bed now.
Goodnight Mariak.
I will play something in bed for a while.
But mosquitoes.
Another side effect of PooF.
Oh wow the android riot app looks so different now.
hi
Wake up.
What about jacksfilms?
Is he the guy making fun of jake paul?
Is there an update for riot?
What...?
Multiple IP's finally got around to us?
Did this not happen before?
Toka got a hair cut :)
Yes it is the best one, but she does not like it.
The uk cracking down on those middle eastern intruders.
Hey.
Heylo
Hey!
Egypt is not banned from any of our trackers I think.
Watch out.
Toka says it does not.
I think it is the best.
Nope.
Short hair is better.
Toka is saying that everything is the worst, and that she will be harassed so much more, and she looks like a man from the 80s.
Her hair was so knotted before, and impossible to brush.
They claim it is automatic.
The story is one of us moved to egypt, but use a computer back home to seed.
Also that we have a vpn in france.
What, is it a permaban?
This is a legitimate use-case.
Getting banned, you go into the irc chat and make a case.
Then they give you a slap on the bottom and let you back in.
I remember we got banned somewhere else.
But I was too pissed off at them.
Or the same place, who know.s
Might be worth asking why.
There was no warning or anything in our messages.
Okay she is not here now. What is it out of ten?
I think 9.
I think you had to see it up close before and after.
How long must I wait.
Does it not work on your phone?
Clicking it should download the file I think, then you can play it with a music player.
Yeah, I spoke backwards then reversed it.
For a jar of poof
That seems too expensive.
Fritlitlliz became an openmw dev.
Hi

Baaaaaby
If you can not open chrome, restart the computer.

Looks like it.
I am okay.
Pooped 5 times, peed 7 or so.
Good morning.
I am so hungry.
What will I eat when I get home?
Oh we are getting two pots of ma7shy.
I am so excited for ma7shy jesuuuus.
Euf I am HOMEEEEEEEEE.
How much is it, when will it arrive, when are you home, I love you, why do you love your hair today?
I am home.
Are you fine?
Also minecraft?
Mumble
I AM SO EXCITED FOR MASHY
When are you home.
When is she here.
Was it because I was talking backwards?
No no we eat together.
AM WAITING
LOVE YOU
I am fine.
I am waiting for toka to come home and mashy.
Will you send you.
Still forever away.
Oh it is nice.
The beach is not hat though.
And why are you listening to not the water?
Ish.
Are you guys ready?
They poop and pee, and wake up you, and take more effort than zero.
Are you training her to be a super soldier?
She does not pee in your bed and poop in the kitchen though.
Hi.
alt + enter, set-layout toka us, enter
I think.
On your keyboard?
alt + enter, st, enter.
set-layout toka us
Oh, of course on your keyboard :/
pkill sway, type anything other than nothing, enter, startx, enter
Good morning.
How are you?
Oh oh I will have foood soo sooooooooooon.
Minecraft?
I AM HOME.
Did you heat it up?
I love you <3
Of course.
Oh my god
Do not put wool or delicates in, or new colored clothes.
Put washing liquid in the compartment, pick your mode and settings, go.
The big one.
Washing detergent.
Correct.
an eggs worth
Depends on how much clothes you are washing
an egg for a full wash
When are you home?
when are you home.
Why.
Why why why.
If you are done and want to play before mid nine, tell me.
Okay.
I am sleeping for 8 hours but it feels much less.
Okay, we will look.
We have to look at hotel prices for my mum tonight.
7 weeks
Okay.
That site is clickbait hell.
When are you home.
19th of sept
Minecraft?
That is 7 weeks.
Mumble.
THEY did.
I got some food.
fool, bread, sticks, buns, mangoes, grapes.
My usuals.
The end of this week he said last week.
When do you sleep?
Fine.
How are you?
Fine.
How is yours?
This highlights everything I hate about java.
Do you not have anything to do in the day time?
Hmmm, I just phoned, they told me to come in, and got me to quickly fill in a form before a weeding out interview.
The others were dressed up a bit more and had prefilled applications and such.
Pretty sure they are just filtering out real trouble makers though.
It is hard to know were to even start.
HAPPY AUGMENTEST.
Good night?
Oh yeah.
But he does not know yet, only brandon.
When he gets home.
If it is fat, you do not.
You can try something like
sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/sdc1
Hello.
Wait, is this the secret message?
Hot. 37ish.
Yeah take a swimming costume.
I think we will go to alexandria to a nice beach we know.
We have two fans, honestly, it is never too hot in our flat right now and it is 40 most days.
Actually, we have three ceiling fans now.
New underwear would be nice.
I need new socks too but I need to order them.
Take some clothes you can wear in front of us but also shows all the skin.
Summer is just living in underwear.
We have had thunder a few times a year.
Me and toka need to find hotels so we can think of stuff you need when we do that.
Me and toka need to find hotels so we can think of stuff you need when we do that.
I mean sure, that is fine for outside.
But in the house, you want less.
Yeah, I would not wear shorts outside.
But forget jeans.
Light trousers.
Hi.
Haha no.
Unless you are allergic to stuff.
Take like 2 or 3 sets.
Clothes dry in hours.
I suppose when mummy needs her washing done she can just give us a bag.
Yeah it is taking forever to come.
I want toka to try so much british food.
Just sit her down to a dinner of robisons crumpets and fake sausage rolls.
All these foods are completely alien to her.
She will have seen nothing like it before.
Nope, no diluting juice here.
There is, but it is really shit, and unpopular.
Master Rice.
We can list loads of things when I get home.
Hi. I am coming home.
COMING HOME
When are you home today?
I know.
Be home early.
There are mangoes to eat.
Minecraft?
Prime time here.
Where are you?
I am home.
I was home ages ago.
Where are you.
If you pay for damage and losses.
I think 66% the current cost of the camera it it is unrepairable, and lens replacement if you break then lens.
Also stay away from sand.
And always use the strap.
You can statis a rock/tree, hit it, and jump on it in botw.
Where are you.
Will you bring noodles?
Right, my weekend is soon. We can call then.
I KNOW
THAT IT IS AUGUST
nautilus
Did you get it?
:O
Why?
Oh nice, are you ready to start?
Wait, elgin? Or aberlour?
Aberlour is much much much better. And better transport.
Also backshift is much better because it is only 6 hours.
And the work is exhausting.
First you have to decide what you want the computer to do for you.
Or your phone, but android is more difficult to start.
Well, first you have to think of an app you want.
Then, you have to be home early so we can learn learn learn.
<3
You look super.
When are you home.
They will ask you.
They will negotiate it.
They will say they have positions in elgin/aberlour morning/late.
Up to you to agree on one.
Bring noooooooooooodles.
Minecraft?
Mumble?
Dowry
That was not fast :s
Do you want two rooms or one?
You want three rooms...?
You will not sleep in the same room as emma?
Single rooms are looking at 10GBP a night.
Double is 13.50 a night.
Triple is 16.60 a night.
They are all in downtown.
It is the very city center though.
Only 100gbp a night hotels exist outside downtown.
Holiday home was 20 a night last time I stayed in it.
No.
Nothing is near us.
But we can get a 1 hour bus there.
It is a big city with shit drivers, and too many of them.
Though, I could probably cycle there in an hour too.
They do not have a working phone number, we can not tell.
But prices have went up a lot since you last came.
And this place I found is the 5th best rated non-hotel in cairo.
There are but they cost over 100usd a night.
This is the place.
Trip advisor has lots of photos and reviews.
Though, you can look through the "Cairo Speciality Lodging" places and pick yourself if you want.
Most are around the same price.
Downtown is one of the nicer places in dense cairo.
I think I will.
Anyway, tomorrow.
No, these are the cheap ones.
Under the B%B/Inns section.
You can just have a look around.
Oh brocolli is out of season right now.
We are waiting for it.
Plenty of carrots though.
Grapes are 40p a kilogram. 
Not in season yet.
But you can actually get some of these from the supermarkets.
Breadsticks are super cheap too.
Rice is cheap.
Peas, hmmm, they have broad beans.
Not garden peas though.
You should have a look around though.
Oh, they have crazy cheap grilled corn on the cob on the street.
But that is out of season too.
Oranges are out of season.
Mangoes.
Not sure about chocolate.
Yeah.
All the places are basically in the same place.
The do not have chocolate bars though.
You would have to go to a super market.
Same with biscuits.
Even if they did it would be very weird.
They do not eat pig.
Or have toast.
It would be egg, bread, and a tomato.
Probably best to get used to the egyptian breakfast (which is way better).
Fool and ta3meya.
Yeah, but not as cheap.
They eat a lot of feta cheese here.
Not hard cheese though.
And a big pizza cost 3gbp.
Something like 22 egp to a pound.
No toaster because no loafs of bread.
No idea about visas.
Probably 20usd.
MineOS?
That seems like a lot.
We have 4MiB before.
I am taking a week or so off.
I asked a few months ago.
Toka will have trouble I think.
Mariam.y
I woke up.
Yeah I sent that one yesterday too.
We can give them a call later today if you want.
Okay.
Get some of what?
The place only has 5 or 6 rooms.
Mumble?
Wake up wake up.
Is it over yet?
Did you eat today?
I had a giant mango.
But I think I will have to go to the bakery for food.
I am so hungry.
Is it............
Gin and movie night.
Jesus that is so late.
If they want you doing more work in the mornings, schedule less in the afternoons.
You already work the maximum legal working hours, it is illegal for you to do overtime.
But Egyptian law should give you a baseline of morality.
They are exploiting you more that morally agreed on.
No body should sue.
They should reject.
Contracts are not legally required.
You just want one for when they decide to alter history and claim you agreed to 50 hours.
I just went to the bakery.
What do you want to eat?
I have fateer.
And popcorn.
come come come
Are you home yet.
Okay but undercook.
What about fattah?
Why are you using my name?
Okay. Have you left,
No, toka just got home.
230 for a single room with a bathroom.
350 for a double room with a bathroom.
300 for a double room with communal bathroom.
4770egp for 9 nights with 1 single and two doubles with shared bathroom.
About 230gbp.
Oh wait, that calculation was wrong.
8370egp then.
415gbp.
I think booking.com comes out around 8000egp.
Slightly cheaper, but not sure they include tax.
2070egp for you.
6300 for your sister, boyfriend, and neice.
88.5gbp for you.
269gbp for the others.
You pay when you are there.
We can book if you want.
Ready to reply quickly?
single does not have a bathroom inside.
Fine?
The bathroom is clean and big.
Inside the room.
It is in the hotel, jeez.
Lisa, you are sharing a bathroom with two cats.
Bladder.
Okay, it is booked.
No, because then they will shit in the kitchen.
Toka says she can not wait.
I think you guys are half of the guest assuming a full house.
There will only be one or two bathrooms.
Well, I want to buy stuff from amazon, but more than what is on my card.
So once I decide, I can offer you how much I need in egp.
Hello.
Wake up.
I am going home.
I am home.
Hmm after the cleaner finishes.
It could be two hours though.
Well at least I hope she works that long.
She is gone now but I guess it is not a good time.
What did you do today?
These last songs have been great.
I will be on this evening.
Good morning.
Oh, well yeah, you drive. But Elgin is much worse.
The macs here are from 2008.
But they are dual processor, and 16GiB of ram so I think they are fine.
32 threads in top is something I want to see.
Wait, 16 threads.
Ohhhhhh.
The phone is always there? Or was it an item?
It is looking like 251gbp or 5800egp I will need.
Baaaby, how are you?
To buy the computer.
Not buying it yet though.
Just in case the price comes down.
I am still trying to transfer to a mac.
Oh god.
I hope it is not a photo of that.
I am sooooooooo hungry.
I hope you left some pizza.
I will go home for fateer :D
Me too.
I have enough, just not in gbp.
t
Why are you doing exams again.
I think I will get two parts from ebuyer.
Hello.
I have been trying to update this mac to sierra today.
And taking the 10000 backup zips off it.
NOP
I just gave him a "shame, shame".
I did, then I told him off.
I expect next month it will be on time.
It is that one, but it does not make a noise for me.
Also, fan issues are fixable.
He transfers internationally to his egypt account, and he did it late.
I told him to do it earlier, and that payday is the fifth, not the sixth.
He admitted his mistake and said sorry.
I AM SO EXCITED FOR FOOD.
pizza and fateer.
When are you home?
I think it is pasta night.
We have kosa right?
Should be home in around 25 minutes.
No, but I am patching the installer.
2008
What computer do you have there?
251
There is a small probability that I am already home.
What, no.
It is 800 something.
I have 608.
I am short 251.
Yeah, that is the plan.
Skips the middle man in exchanging currency.
I already did.
The numbers are in this chat.
Then I corrected myself.
Something like that.
Heading home now
Ready.
I am home.
Already ate the pizza.
But where is my minecraft time.
I think I do not have long today.
I will start cooking when you get home?
Are you coming.
No, there are three parts.
Tiny things.
About 2kg max I think.
Yeah.
88.5gbp for you, 269gbp for the others.
358 total
300 is probably enough for me.
Which is 7000egp.
Look at you with your fancy new computer.
What hardware does it have?
** Good morning.
I thought about it too, but for the same price you can buy modern hardware that performs much better.
So I quickly rejected the thought.
This one is 2 x quad 2.8ghz second generation core processors, 16 GiB of DDR2 667mhz.
And a Radean HD 2600XT 256MiB.
It really suprised me by the hardware for such an old computer.
It must have cost a fortune when it was new.
No way.
Never ever buy a hard drive.
Or a laptop :/
Or respond to an ad that does not list the exact processor, and age of the machine.
Also intel HD 4000 is too old now.
The zombie level?
Yeah.
COUNTING DOWN UNTIL FOOD TIME
Why is it not here?
ME TOO
I managed to get 10.12.6 installed and my passwords and ssh/gpg keys working.
:D
Mumble?
I AM HOME
What no. I only want to buy 300gbp.
You will have to convert more money to egp for the rest of the costs.
You give me 300gbp in my bank account, and I give you 7000egp when you get here.
You need more egp than that to pay for the inn, and food, etc.
Yeah, but you need to get that from the post office.
Yeah, if you want.
Wait.
I might get something cheaper.
Okay.
Not sure yet.
Want to do a video tour of my items?
As in a video call.
Is she home?
Did she not reply?
Where are you.
No idea.
I asked though.
She should be home any moment now.
Hmmm, 5:17 probably.
Okay.
Toka was at work.
We can do it tomorrow, it is late now.
Or now.
Toka fell asleep.
Wake up.
It is music, and almost bed time.
Why are you not home?
Did you see anything?
Anything worth note.
I made a shopping list of computer parts.
Okay juice and bed time.
Hmmm, I had a sugar bun.
No power in a new city?
You should have to kil yourself in the last mission.
HMMMMMMM.
IS IT OUR WEDDING ANI
Wait, trying to get my layout working.
Because the 8th of something and not 9/11 because that was the engagment.
What is the b.
Good morning.
It was dark and gloomy.
Yeah okay.
I am so hungry.
I have fateer at home and apple juice.
The shop no longer sells orange juice :(
Have at 7 too.
Going home now.
I am home.
Twenty minutes?
Not yet.
Actually, maybe not. But maybe.
Home to do a tour?
No.
Oh.
I never got those messages.
Hold on.
Do you have the option for video here?
Yeah, it fails.
Oh, yeah they will have a lot of interviews.
I am home.
Hmmm.
Nothing serious.
Just your preferences.
They are just checking you are not insane.
I think the fact you got an interview means they are going to give you the job.
What?
Morning shift finishes at 2:30.
They have a lot of positions.
They double their employees this time of year.
I think not public ones.
There is not much childcare at all.
Not much care at all.
In Cairo?
Well yeah, you probably could.
People love foreigners.
Do you want interviews in your time here?
Are we moving the Meredith family to Egypt?
Also, jamie.
Your pay would not even cover the flights.
You are looking at 2 months work for a single flight.
I mean, I easily got a job in the field I really wanted in.
And I imagine doing the same in the UK would have been impossible.
Neither can I.
I suppose children can not speak English.
Anything to do with childcare?
I will keep an eye on the job lists.
This is the best site for it, I think.
The top posts are extra paid to be at the top, so skip past the top.
Quite a few preschool english teacher jobs.
Not seeing anything with childcare though.
It is possible, new cairo is a city outside cairo though.
This is old, but the same area toka works.
3500 should be your absolute minimum wage.
Like you do not get a quote in the interview for a solid number, you should reject them.
You can really negotiate here.
Another one in the same place as toka.
I still have no visa here hahaha.
No work permit either.
See if you can survive a week first.
Is poppy going to hold you back for the next five years?
Where are you.
I did that once.
Hi.
Fine.
It is our aniverisary today.
It is bad at first but once you get to know everyone in the factory, it is good.
When are you home today.
Jeez.
Oh nice. Which factory?
Morning or back?
I was in the biscuit factory, which I liked, but it is the hardest.
All the others are so slow.
Jeez.
Cracked at the ferris wheel.
You should have certificates for those things.
Canteen cover is making food and selling food in the canteen.
You actually have to make sandwhiches.
Covering while the permentant staff are away.
They do not care about lack of experience, you should claim you have none.
Okay.
He came.
Maybe his stream.
Probably just people looking through matches and gamemodes.
Are you finished.
You should do a few hours checking an online food safety course.
Should ease your lie.
There is probably a good video on youtube.
And refilling the vending machine and counter.
And cleaning up after everything.
And doing the dishes.
And putting the chairs out and back.
And topping up the free biscuit boxes.
Keeping track of orders for the week.
Heating up soup.
Keeping water jugs topped up.
Canteen is not a full shift I think.
Usually 8.5 hours. 50 minute break or something. Depends on the factory.
Pull you through?
So you are not working in the canteen.
Just covering when needed.
I thought you were just in the canteen.
Good morning.
I never noticed it.
I just thought he was saying there are fewer men.
Is it disco day, or karate day?
Hmmm yes.
The t-shirt has smudges on it.
Hungry.
That is all I am.
I had none at home.
I miss my linux already.
I need my tiling window manager and freedom to edit how things work.
I wish xcode was on linux.
I think me even more so because I wrote patches for the software I used all the time.
Here I also do not have full control over my keyboard input.
NO
I am really busy right now though.
I am late today.
I am so hungry.
And there is no food home.
As soon as I get home I have to go back out to get food.
IT IS MY WEEKEND
I learnt to sing happy birthday backwards yesterday.
Let me sing it to you.
I recently got a new hobby.
i started learning how to speak backwards.
Here is me singing happy birthday backwards.
WHO HAS A WEEKEND
IT IS A SCARY PLACE
FOR A LITTLE ANT
Meredith chat.
Hi.
Okay I am really home now.
Can you voice chat today?
You just missed the longest yeah boii ever (NEW WORLD RECORD 2017)
Mine craft in an hourish?
Wow, that was not phone worthy.
Well yeah, when no one speaks for ten minutes, I will leave.
15 minutes later and he has not replied :/
You heard me.
I am a liar.
I have stuff getting in the way.
What are you doing?
Only if you bring juice.
When are you home?
Nop.
No koshary?
What happened.
Did you tell them to get fucked?
And ran.
Do I cook?
Pasta?
ETA?
Okay, your order has been placed.
When do you start?
It is an mp3.
If your phone can not play an mp3...
Try not to talk too much to people until you know who is who and who is good and who is bad.
Because you will have to work with them every day.
So you want to make the correct impression, and talk to the better people.
You get an upper hand if you just pretend to be quiet and shy and observe the others.
Then after a while you can know what not to say to each person.
Just say yes to the manager, and do what the manager says.
Pretty sure morning shift has a lot more older people on it though.
At first you will also be too slow at everything and fail a lot and be annoying to others.
But onec you are good at everything it is easy.
You get given shoes.
Clean them each morning or you will have disgusting shoes eventually.
They provide wet wipes and shoe spray.
Do it each morning.
For the first few weeks you will be too slow at everything and it feels awful.
But eventually you do it without thinking.
Also, people are used to really slow people coming all the time.
Still annoys them though.
Also, I would leave your phone at home.
You get a locker, but they are shit.
And if you want to lock it, you have to take your own lock.
Curious to know which factory you are going to.
I think you will not be canteen.
I know the one, yeah she is nice.
Canteen is usually permenant staff all year round.
She hires too many people jeez.
I was also like four years ago.
And she saw me once.
Keep an eye out for Phillip haha.
I have to go cook dinner.
Take your home keys.
You get free biscuits at lunch.
And free water.
If you want more than that, bring a pack lunch or a couple of pound for buying a lunch.
My pocket.
Most people do, because they have locker keys too.
But make sure you do not lose them.
And a key comes in very useful opening things when you do not have a knife.
No idea.
What the fuck is that pallet mansion?
Are you becomming a shopoholic?
But what happens when you eventually do have enough money.
Well yeah, but it was edited to look like he did it alone, and it was massive.
Come in.
I woke up.
Why did you fall asleep so early?
Yeah.
About an hour ago.
Thirsty.
Oh wait, coffee.
You left half a tomato here.
Minecraft?
Look like 20% to me.
Starting it now, let me get coffee.
I put it in the bathroom behind the toilet.
And marmite.
Hello.
How old?
Hmmmm.
Scobby doo?
Spongebob?
6 year old, dorra the explorer.
6 year old, peppa pig?
Scooby do then I think.
Who. 
I think I am the wrong person to answer though.
The bus to where?
What are you doing?
Did you hear my recordings?
WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SHOW THEM?
Dinna be stupit peppa, yer da's a fat fuck.
Yes.
If you promise not to cry.
When are you home though.
Do we get 7up and juice?
Do we get more gin just in case?
Okay, but juice?
Is it too late for samboooosa?
(Is it too late to sampoligiza?)
They both do.
The chrome default ad blocker is a disaster.
Also the number of people who use the internet without blocking ads is disgusting.
If it was a choice between the internet with ads and no internet, the no internet choice would win for me.
kurgsgraft
Firefox also has sponsered content on the new tab page, and some vodafone owned voip service built in.
They also track users (without exception) during the installing extensions process.
They consider the data too valuable.
I think the best bet is any browser with plenty of privacy extensions.
Where are you.
Where were you?
Hmm, no.
I am mainly just fixing everything right now.
You woke up at 2am?
Come in, wake up, be here.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Did you hear my recordings?
Why are you always out or asleep.
We had roast vegetables tonight.
And samboosa for lunch.
What will you order?
Fattah is just rice and bread and should be the cheapest thing ever.
I already had samboosa today but I am craving more.
Can't a boy have his hobbies?
What is.
Did you see the new D8 compiler in 3.0 beta?
Well at least no one will know me there.
Maybe.
Hmmmm.
Have you abandoned pineapple juice?
I have pineapple juice here.
Oh no, I got pomegranete instead.
Why are jam jars so hard to open.
What is your favourite food on earth so far?
Why do I like the smell of onions on my hands so much?
This is the most boring thing.
Yes.
I would rather eat almost anything else.
Only a few things are worse.
Like guavas.
And rye bread.
I had more samboosa.
I do not want to sleep though.
I never want to sleep when toka is not home.
I do just want to keep eating though.
Both.
Had MegaPoop 2.
Nope.
But I should very soon.
Hi.
I want to eat.
I am going to hamza's in Nasr city with two coworkers.
Or maybe primos.
Working on Qabi (Cargo) again :D
I am home.
I am so so so so hot and thristy.
It is a new name for Cargo.
Fixing things. Or putting things in that never existed.
Like server sms verification :/
Did you find a bus back?
It was fine, a lot of walking though.
Have you heard of family park?
I do not count them as friends.
In rehab.
They tried to make me go to rehab baby, I said oh no it is too far and they have gates.
But family park looks nice.
But I am scared to go anywhere.
Is it better than rehab?
I havebeen to rehab four times.
It is nice but I do not like the whole gate, walls, security thing.
It feels like you have no freedom, guilty at all times, and that they put themselves above others.
Onces walls start being built...
Learn to live together.
Did you hear the recordings yet.
Will you just forget them?
Hello.\\
I should really really sleep.
I have six hours of sleep now.
I never get sleepy when toka is not yheremb
This is not my keyboard.
Toka'sw mine is still in my bag.
Nope.
But I am going now.
Goodnight mariak.
Yeah but leaving now.
Wait until I get to work.,
Morrrning <3
:(
When did you get home?
:/
When are you home today?
I am going home now to work.
This computer does not work with the emulator and no one can lend me a phone.
And I have lots of work to do.
Who.
Hold on, let me get home first.
I may be working late today.
Until I am finished.
Are you finished?
Hmmm yeah.
I might have to work until 9-10ish.
But there is no way I am working 5 days this week.
Okay.
Be fine.
<3
I am full.
Hi.
I worked 13 hours today :(
I am making samboosa.
Yes.
Can you not not watch the match?
Is no one going to light it?
It is too everything.
Toka is sleeping.
So I had to eat all the samboosa.
She went to the north coast yesterday and came back at 5am, then got up for work at 8am.
Then come come at 9pm.
Or 8pm.
And me.
Not yet.
I am exhausted though.
I think I want to eat even though I am not hungry.
Even pineapples and mixed berries?
Even special K?
I have not had it here.
Even 35 is too much for 1kg of cereal.
I will sleep.
Goodnight mariak.
Good morning <3
I need so much sleep and caffiene.
Sleepy, exhausted.
How are you?
Will you suggest something to eat tonight?
Oh earrrly.
I had four cups of tea so far.
I need more coffee.
Hmmmmm.
I just want to relax tonight.
Magdy is in the other branch for a week.
Also the cleaner has not been in three days and it is looking dire.
Well, just the kitchen.
Mr Noodle is using every dish possible.
And cloggin the drains with noodles.
Hmmmm noodles.
To be fair the cleaner is at fault, not us.
If magdy wants to pay 4500 a month for a cleaner, I will clean all he wants.
No idea.
I think he is paid by the day.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
You know all the channels I like.
If they like history, lindybeige.
He does nice long videos on interesting topics.
And slow and clear.
If they are interested in lockpicking...
Oh.
Whatever the name is.
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY
It was my sister's first day at the factory today.
Is it even a program?
Oh shit.
Oatcakes lines usually never change.
Very repetative.
Yeah, dominate the thing to make sure it registers.
You can swipe again, it does not matter.
You found the bus place though.
Yeah, every 30 minutes or an hour you move around.
That way you learn to do everything.
Anyway, glad it was fine.
She said it was fine.
When are you home.
Jeez.
When did you leave?
Which class?
Still leaving at 8?
Maybe.
I hate having to take all the seeds out of the eggplants though.
Nevermind.
Pasta for dinner?
Yeah now it is close.
I am home.
That is not an android navigation drawer.
The SETTINGS text is not centered.
Like someone has placed it manually.
Nah, you will last in shortbread 2.
It is nothing like elgin or the biscuit factory.
Once you get the hang of things, nag the trainer about "getting your jobs signed off".
Once you finish 3 months, you get a pay rise.
Then once you get 20 jobs, another pay rise.
Eugh mine too.
You will be home around 9?
EUGH NO BREAD
Called it.
I mostly only like material design.
Everything is very strict.
Easier to do the real design than mock one up in photoshop.
How are you?
I will go to the bakery.
The internet keeps dying.
The ETA is 3 hours 50 :(
Which as long as we blast, is tonight.
I went to the bakery.
I started it as soon as I got home.
It is downloading sequentially, so we can start about 3:10.
I got breadsticks, bread, bread buns, and bread fateer.
Then I went and got bread fool mahawig.
The very first thing I designed was paulmeredith.com
I ran a website that was basically a profile for me and my friends.
If you have 23 pounds, could you get coffee?
Okay bring orange juice too.
And noodles.
And a motorbike.
Make sure it is the big coffee pack, once they charged us 23 for the small one too.
I used to have a running joke with my mum.
Every time she asked if I needed anything (which was a lot), I said a motorbike.
Or if I came downstairs and she asked what I was looking for, it was a motorbike.
I really want one of the browsers to officially ship as an AppImage.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I am okay.
Are you fine?
What is wrong?
Anxiety for a reason?
:(
No, I told magdy about my excess hours and asked him if he had a preference.
He said he will pay overtime for the hours.
Why are you accepting that?
Overtime is always optional.
Their fault for not scheduling correctly.
Their fault for not hiring enough workers to do the hours.
Why do you take the fall for things they are doing wrong?
They should suffer for making mistakes.
No, you offer to suffer instead of them.
How is an 11 hour working day not suffering?
I still have an hour.
I am home.
Are you drinking too much caffiene?
Too much caffiene is the only reliable way I become anxious.
Are you hla?
Does she still have leukemia?
There are a gang of 7 year olds with sticks hitting everything outside.
I hope they hit each other.
One of my friends has luekemia when he was 8.
He was fine by the end of primary school though.
They are actually worse than the stray dogs.
What is the thing you like best about you?
Any, both.
I like being happy and I like orange juice, but I like one better.
The entire thing, not a single flaw.
Every perceives reality slightly different, but too big and you are failing to correctly observe reality.
You can perceive it with a different perspective and interpret it differently.
But I think this can not be the best thing.
This is just different.
I do not like mashed potatoes because my family made too much of them and made me eat them.
So I view potatoes with negative thoughts.
What part of your body are you least satisfied with?
Well, that seems normal.
You should try to stop caffiene for a while.
See if it helps.
Although, the first few days can be hell.
My description is: no motivation to do things, sleeping all the time, and someone trying to spoon your eyes out 24/7.
Did you leave.
If I remember correctly, tea has about 30% the amount of caffiene.
Not sure about the dust tea here though.
It seems stronger.
Are you ever coming home.
I am sweating so much.
Prepare for onion farts.
Hello.
What can be wrong with thighs?
My thighs are like a horses.
My waist is a little fat though.
My worst part is probably my bum.
It gets ingrowns and they irritate and are red spots.
And it gets so hairy.
My eyebrows grow too much.
So many come out when I pull on them.
And it joins in the middle when I forget to pull the middle ones with tweezers.
I do not like anything that is a contious lossing battle.
continuous?
perpetual
No matter how many times I shave my legs, they are always hairy.
Tired I think.
For a short while.
Sorry.
No. I leave her for a moment and she gets sucked into her phone.
Not yet.
I just do not want to order and the next day something better comes out.
I am about to now.
I was shaving and cutting my nails and eating.
Goodnight mariak.
Leaving work now.
Wait.
I am still here for a while.
But using the phone so I am slow.
What did you have?
Where are you.
Fine mostly.
I am almost off.
Good morning.
Are you still alive?
I need more coffee.
Home time now.
I want to get a build first though.
Quickly.
With photos?
All there is for that is suffering.
Unless you have a great camera, and consistant bright light conditions, any photo recognition is unusable.
Somethings work when they have high contrast.
Like bar codes.
And there are so so so many different coins and notes.
And are you meant to lay out all the currency without overlap on a white table before taking a photo from the roof?
This is like trying to train your dog to clean the house.
Even if you did, it would be shit and slow at cleaning.
Our coins are designed to feel different and unique.
Our notes are different sizes.
Google has a cloud photo recognition service.
But I really really doubt it will work for currency.
Yeah, give it a few weeks and it will be easy.
Everyone is shit when they start.
Is the feeder the hardest for you?
Or the boxer?
Eventually you stop counting.
A tip is to count 2,3,4,5,6... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Just skip counting the first one.
Do you do skillets?
I will be back in 30 minutes.
Yeah eventually all these things you do with your eyes shut at double speed.
WHO HAS A WEEKEND <3
No more onion farts :(
I am home.
Late but home.
If someone can use machine learning to do that task, they belong at google.
I like the smell.
He probably just realised that people are insane and like a show more than their children's welfare.
Eat, watch, sleep.
Now is my rest time.
What will you do.
No.
I will wait until next sunday.
Will you watch rick and morty?
Tell him to hold his horses.
I did some code edits to dwm to make it work a certain way.
I think you are going to love it.
Hi.
No.
I am configuring stuff.
I made an edit to the source of my window manager that adds a property to windows which makes them ignore focus shifting and not draw borders.
And I made a dock appear on every tag.
So now I am getting the icons on the dock nice.
Are you awake?
I was waiting for toka to come home.
And now I have no idea.
How are you feeling about people?
Rick and morty.
Do you want to commit your life to him?
Until you do.
Your parents would probably only let you live with him if you marry, and then you are stuck.
Probably stuck but it is good right now.
I should go to bed before my body collapses.
Goodnight mariam.
I am still not tired.
Between 17 and 20 I was not looking for a partner.
I never was.
But I found one.
I woke up.
Oh wow.
Does it make you hate teaching them less?
Hahahaha.
Sabah el whereismycoffeenooor.
Yeah, but can you even take them?
Hello.
I am making coffee.
I have coffee.
Did you just wake up?
Chanting children woke me up.
Well they signed up for the rest of the year.
Good morning.
What the hell.
A new mitchel and webb series is coming out.
But not sketches.
Just a comedy series where they are brothers.
Although.....
Going to order it now.
The computer should arrive between the 22nd and the 26th.
Then 21-22nd should be a usb card reader, two cables, two micro sd cards, one pack of two ram modules, one samsung ssd.
Yes, but it is tiny.
Hungry.
Hungry at work, hungry at home.
How are you? 
Did you stop tea and coffee?
It would help if you put two of the things inside the computer.
I can step you through it in a video chat.
Then it will look like you are just taking your computer, with two cables, and a keyboard.
And the fragile things would be safe in the computer.
I ordered the shopping list.
The ram went down 4gbp, but it is forcast to keep increasing to the end of 2018, which is insane.
Of coffee?
When are you home?
Getting paid weekly will be nice.
I miss that.
A lot of people leave.
I just switched my monitor to dp1.2 for a period of 4k in 60fps, rebooted and it started x with the correct settings.
Never happened before, not with the daisy chaning thing.
It is too slow.
Hi.
Scared to turn off the monitor though.
I have a white spot on my finger tip.
And I can see it pulsing.
It is weird.
A blister.
Yeah.
I switched back.
The UI.
When my 640 pro gets here.
I ordered today.
Have you treated it?
It turned out to be one of the tiny blister things I had a few weeks ago.
I really want to know what the problem is.
Oh wow.
Good biscuits?
The chocolate ones go fast.
I only buy nucs these days.
What kind of juice?
Unlimited?
I found what it is.
Dyshidrotic eczema.
Shit.
Always leave the tls certificates until it is too late.
You might get deliveries tomorrow.
Oh.
Oh yeah. Between 22 and 26.
Forth poop today :O
Moorning.
How are you feeling?
I ordered my new computer yesterday :D
It is an intel nuc 7i5bnk with 16GiB of ram, and a samsung 960 pro 512GiB nvme m2 drive.
The storage and ram cost more than the computer :/
Oh the processor is a i57260U, with an iris 640 pro.
I told you multiple times.
It is opening on your laptop screen.
Click the monitor looking screen in the dock.
Tick use external only and disable laptop.
Apply.
Close the settings, open the settings.
It is very very different.
Everything is observable or an observer.
Reactive programming seems to be the fad right now.
But I think it is not simple or easy for people to understand.
So I am not much a fan.
It says the cause is unkown.
But the things that could apply to me are washing my hands too much, and an allergy to something, maybe dust mites.
So I am trying to use less soap and changing the sheets more often on the bed.
When are you home today.
We have a movie to finnish.
And a programming class you skipped.
Eating alone then :(
I am coming home now.
<3
What did you eat?
You left the music on for the cats.
Someone did the dishes :*
Hi.
Hello?
Come home before I bore to death.
Bring something tasty.
Good morning.
We are having a fun day on the 17th of september I think.
To fayouz.
faiyum.
Also we get 5 days off for the feast.
Yeah.
fouryum
I need mega tea.
dagger is something I tried and will for sure use in any projects from now on.
I am full.
I got banned from my gaming tracker :(
The most seeded torrent on thepiratebay will probably be fine.
Or any uploaded with a pink or green skull.
Godus is the game on your phone?
For the pc?
Where are you.
Are you too weirded out by my fingers.
Need mega food.
Uh oh, I think I am out of fool.
Why were you home at 3am?
Had to double take at 21:20.
What is your favourite thing you have done this week?
I found a way of stopping the cats from laying in and making a mess of their food.
Maybe.
Or ordering the computer.
I am not sure.
Why are they yelling aslan?
I mean, she sounds right.
Is she really yelling?
Are you home earlier today.
Everyone is making a mistake by not getting toe shoes.
Did you ever hear my recording?
Yeah.
Where are you.
The first 20 seconds of this, what is it?
The melody at the beginning is from something.
It is driving me crazy.
Like an old game, or a guitar hero song, it must be something.
I have tetris or russian polka or folk.
This is my target.
Oh.
Open scratch text editor.
Two of them.
In one open ~/.source/dwm/config.h
The other open ~/.source/dwm-6.1/config.h
Scroll down until you see the key mappings.
Make the letters on the dwm-6.1/config.h into numbers like the dwm/config.h one.
Match up the correct lines though.
Then when you have finished, open a terminal, and type `cd ~/.source/dwm-6.1; make install`
Then press ctrl+alt+q to restart dwm.
They are text files.
Or wait, there might be a program to help.
Are you home today?
Jesus I can not even connect.
The internet is bad here too :/
`go get -u github.com/spolu/warp/client/cmd/warp`
Then type `warp open poka`
Did you do it?
No, the go get and warp thing.
Yes.
Let me go poop.
Hmmm.
My internet is dismal, hold on.
Bismal?
abismal?
abysmal?
Dismal is correct.
But I morphed the word into abysmal, which also applies.
I think the devoloper has not renewed their tls certificatse :/
The warp developer.
You can learn ieon malesh.
Yeah.
FASTER
Because you go back to qwerty because it is faster for you.
alt
Left alt, right alt is the third level, right shift is the second level, left control is control.
I think because they are already open on tag 4.
I definitly had qbittorrent open.
terminal: `pgrep qbittorrent`
Yeah it is running.
You can type `pkill qbittorrent`
Then start it again.
Also set the limit high.
It is at 20 right now I think.
Food morning.
Magdy finally got coffee so I am okay.
WHAT IS IN THEM
ANY NOTES?
Coffee is coffee.
Sorry, sensitive topic.
Yeah.
I am actually really hungry.
I have at home some really datey things from the bakery.
I am looking forward to them.
Nice.
You can open these up and put them in a little bag.
They are tiny.
Because I never eat.
Yesterday I had green beans and spinach cooked into a sauce thing.
I had three of the date things.
I had a fool with extra chilli in the morning with two breads.
I had orange juice and lots of water.
And two large coffees.
And one tea.
I had a few grapes.
Oh I have onions now, I can make crispy onion bits.
I had a spoon of flax seeds.
And a little bit of doum.
That was yesterday.
Today I had the same breakfast, and three of those long rolls with some cheese in for lunch.
And two large coffees.
Like a little fabric bag with a fastener on.
Just anything small that holds small things together.
But that does not look like a drug bag.
To stop them from getting misplaced or lost, or eaten by a cat.
Also, maybe take a pen drive or something to egypt so I can give you loads of photos to take home.
I have had fool everyday for ages.
But I recently started adding chilli to make it tastier.
Baroody always gives me the chilli in the morning breakfast.
And I always eat it.
I am not very good with hot food.
But I think I am getting better.
Four more items are due for delivery today.
What the hell.
Out for delivery, Perth, GB.
Nah, it is correct.
Who knows, it is Hermes UK.
The items you have were Royal Mail.
Yes.
Not there yet.
COMING HOME
Princess Diana, it's in the name.
That joke requires arabic, english, and a childhood playing EA sports games.
The reference is EA Sports, it's in the game.
Hello Ms Mariam.
to
I feel like a king coming home to orange juice and date.
A date with the orange juice.
Because it is the version that does not indicate marital status, and is the only version that should exist.
Did you eat?
It sounds similar to teeth grinders.
Just the eclipse.
What will you do today?
Shit.
We hit our 150GiB quota.
Hmmmmm.
I just paid for the internet with my card.
But I also requested a change of plan to the one we wanted.
The download has 11 hours left :(
We hit our download limit.
BE HOME ALREADY
It was game of thrones night but not any more.
I woke up an hour early by accident.
And I noticed a few minutes before I was going to leave.
I have a lot of september off.
It is a holiday time at the start too.
I asked for it.
No idea, did things arrive?
I watched a video but I forgot what one.
And I read news.
22/08/2017\t09:37\tDue to be delivered today
Odd.
Are you sure you want to take it to work?
It is expensive.
Oh that was early!
We are going to game so much together.
You can replace ben.
I wonder if we have internet.
I forgot to set the download :/
Yeah.
There should be more arriving today, the rest.
Aparrently the four other packages went through the letterbox.
I am still hungry.
COMING HOME
You are home early today?
Tap is tomorrow?
OI WHEN ARE YOU HOME
You are?
Did my things arrive?
Hellooo?
Think that is everything.
See the 960 pro, that is an absolute beast.
3500MiB/s read speeds.
Maybe a weird al song?
Pretty sure it is russian.
Or HOI?
I will hate my life if it was an old flash game.
Maybe that sledging game.
Some game we played in the library and hacked the high scores with a memory editor.
Each place is usually between 50 and 150egp.
Travel is nothing.
Food is about half the price.
It is british money.
I would think so.
We get 400 a month combined and we have to pay rent and bills.
No?
I mostly just drink coffee these days.
I only have tea when the coffee here runs out.
Stop all sugar.
It is just energy without nutrition.
Eat literally anything else instead.
Are you going to bulid the pc tonight?
Just five screws, three slots.
Magdy just told me I am working tomorrow.
Maybe.
So I told him no, I will not work 6 days a week with that much notice, and now I am not working tomorrow.
Aparrently he left it to word of mouth to spread the notice.
And it never got to me.
You will see four screws, one in each corner.
Me too :(
I hope the internet is fast.
Still pending :(
Hi.
Is it assembling time?
Actually, our internet is bad now.
You are not coming home :(
I am sooooooooo hungry.
Phillips size 1 and size 2.
Small cross ones.
PH1, PH2.
Mariam, come in before I bore my self into a statue.
Yeah put the computer upside down on something sofe.
soft
So the top does not scratch.
They do not fully come out, but once they are all loose, you can take it in half.
Hello?
Wait.
I think it is official: you are going crazy over it.
An elastic band will help.
Call.
Did you eat it all?
Okay call.
No idea what computer that is.
When are you home.
I was just trying to brush the knots out of the ginger cat.
And it was very relaxed and on its back.
Some big knots came out but then I notice red skin.
And I think it was relaxed at large portions of its hair being pulled out.
It never even meowed.
I think it can be left for the groomer.
Are you going to lose sleep over this screw?
A different nuc with two pci-e 4x slots.
n
It is the nuc6i7kyk, I have the nuc 7i5bnk
I have been playing lots of stepmania.
I must have super strength fingers by now.
The notes are so fast and I do not know how my finger do it.
It is faster than I can read them.
My mum was trying to build my new computer today.
But she got stuck on one screw.
And it stressed her out so much.
And she was sweating and stressing.
She gave up and now she is sending me tutorials saying it is just a normal screw.
The screw is going to give her nightmares.
What will you do tonight?
Have you ever tried stepmania?
Not even curious?
Ah yeah, just untar the archive from the site.
A few dependencies to resolve.
Never ending study.
The default theme is ass, and the config needs heavily modified.
I have been playing stepmania for two or three hours.
No idea how my fingers are surviving.
pacman -Fo /usr/lib/libjpeg.so.xx
It takes too much set up, but your config is like your dwm/config.h
I am Turkey.
Since when are games ever maintained to currently library versions.
They all ship with their own versions.
Almost all open sources games are a peice of shit.
I would rather shove shit up my ass than boot windows.
What will you eat?
I still have slow internet.
50KiB/s.
Do you have early or late work tomorrow?
The 24th I think.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
But I am not hopeful.
I will shave my head.
Going to update riot to 0.12
I shaved my head.
It feels much cleaner.
Oh I think the speed is back.
I woke up.
Oh wow.
Did you stay up all night doing it?
The cat is eating my chin.
How did you do it?
A good screw driver makes all the difference.
Yeah.
The rest is unboxing and putting everything in a small back to protect it all.
Not a suitcase jeez.
It does not leave your back.
Yeah, expensive things in your backpack.
Not if it is all unboxed.
My backpack on the way here was jam packed with electronics.
It was pretty funny unpacking it.
Yeah.
I always get picked for a manual search.
Bald head and electronics is apparently suspicious.
Yeah, but there is nothing illegal about electronics...
And in cairo it is just a shitshow so I doubt they will do anything there.
Oh true.
Luckily they are all the same key.
They are shit in Cairo.
100 people wanting to thing they have authority and nobody actually having any control or authority.
Okay.
WE HAVE THE EPISODE SO HUUUUUUURYYYYYYYYY.
My mum could not sleep because of the screw and got a screw driver off the neighbour, watched some videos, and managed to do it.
Morning <3
Impossible.
Why have I not had coffee yet.
What?
Are you home yet.
Wake up.
WHAT IS THE ETA
Also, what are we eating.
Is it order night?
Are you tapping tonight?
When?
When are you tapping?
HURRY
Hahaha yeah, usually the canteen people because someone told them too.
I never got one because I never told any one.
No idea about your factory.
Pretty sure violetta worked backshift in one of the aberlour factories.
Having worked both morning shift and back shift, back shift people are definitely better.
Morning shift people have sticks up their asses.
The best thing to do to shitty people is to never talk to them.
Nah, they will be called racist no matter what the race.
Even if you have to work with them, just never speak to them.
I had to work with a 45 year old woman who never said or did anything to indicated she hated me, but I felt like she hated me.
For like 6 months.
I would stop speaking to them, and they would also never speak to me, and I always wondered if maybe they are the one that thinks I hate them.
Also, someone I liked accussed me of something, and I stopped speaking for the rest of the day.
And then it became so weird and we never said a word for two months.
I forgot who spoke first, but we were so glad when the silence broke.
CONFESS
The younger the person the worse they are, at everything.
We had chocolate biscuits on most lines, but never a dedicated chocolate line.
Tantrums are pretty funny.
There are often pretty strict rules and patterns that everyone knows, and when you first start, you have no idea and nobody shows you.
Skillets too, like where to place the skillets, which direction, etc.
But yeah, anyone who has been there less time than you will lose any argument.
Yeah, I know.
It is funny eventually.
The young girls are much better, but they usually quit much sooner.
Do you recognise anyone there?
I recognised quite a lot.
The whole of morning shift is pretty shit.
Do you know shannon mckandie?
Would have been a year or two below you in lossiemouth.
Sister of andy mckandie.
May have been your year.
19/20.
I had michael farquar as my trainer.
Year above me in lossie.
I wonder if she knows you.
I will email her.
Daddy had a different experience.
You really might not have lasted a week if you had the same position as him.
Elgin at christmas is balls insane.
Jesus, shannon is the fastest email responder ever.
She does not know you.
I told her to hunt you down.
Yeah just scroll to the end and listen to the results.
The end one seems pretty close to solving text to speech.
The reverse is still way more difficult because all text is the same no matter who types it.
But I wonder if google use deep learning for their speech to text.
Where are you today.
ALREADY SEEN IT
Did she enjoy it?
Hi
Hello.
hello
Yeah I saw that.
Never thought too much about what it could mean though.
Did I send you this?
Potato scone day.
Oh i miss cake.
HLA
So is toka and nada.
Yeah.
I hate them.
Well, you might still hate it and just not hate seeing hazem.
Are you nervous at all?
I still have not seen you two together.
Yes, the concert.
Now or after the concert?
Does he not find it weird that you have none?
He looks older and different now.
Just use encryption.
You two look very nice.
Mabye the third time I saw you smile.
TAKE OUT FOOL
Did he have a hair cut?!
He looks weird.
Our cats are long hair and now I am jealous.
Only place to get some quiet.
Did you manage the keyboard?
HEY.
MAKE SURE TO CUT THE HAIR
This looks like Don't Starve art.
I am so excited to see the cat without hair.
20egp/GiB
Ish.
Wait no.
10egp/GiB.
When are you leaving tonight?
I am coming.
DID YOU LEAVE
To the concert.
They just left here.
The flat just smells like perfume.
Our female cat finally got shaved.
Where are the tweezers?
Crazy eyes just knocked over the glass triangle holder with stones in.
Which is a crazy co-incidence.
He is sniffing the incense.
Because they make the house less hairy.
Oh wow, is the place small?
Remind me tomorrow to copy the minecraft server to another server before it expires.
Tomorrow before midday I guess.
Which painting was it?
Ah I know this person.
Where is the drawing of me though?
Baby.
Me too.
There was nothing this morning :(
Oh wow the new riot at riot.lost.host has auto complete emojis.
:heart_e
I neeeeed ta5me3ya7
Our office person is not here.
And our boss is not here.
And coffee is not here.
U/
:/
I am home.
Did you get asmaa's job?
When.
Are you getting fool.
How big is the surprise?
Did you order hummous?
How was the concert?
How was nada?
How was hazeem?
What?
What,?
You have to use a tripod, and take two photos.
But being careful to get the feet in the exact same position.
It is not called anything.
Try something like mismatched shadow.
Or edited shadow.
Different shadow.
It has no name though.
Is that a review of egypt?
DOWNLOAD THE EPISODE
1080p
Drag the file to qbittorrent, not transmission.
No.
broadcasthe.net
dl
Right click it and download sequentially.
What do you think of a cleaning party with kareem and khaled?
They said they will bring food and drink but I said only if we literally clean the flat.
Our one.
That fool was from this morning.
I have most of next month off.
Coming home.
Are you all excited,
HELLO
KILL HER
Wher are you.
mmmmmmmmmmm
I am home.
:/
It is too late.
And game of thrones has another 4 hours.
So I have no internet.
Yeah, at balls80p.
144p, youtube rips.
to
Any if it is good quality, shame on her for destroying everyone elses internet for the day.
When are you home.
Hello.
Finish faster.
45 minutes faster.
If I list cables, you will not know what they are.
We can video call tonight?
Morning.
I need holidays now.y
5 for the feast then 7 for myself.
ish
Yeah, my mum and sister are coming.
What is Ras Sedr?
You will go by yourself?
Do you have a large family?
I just have one sister.
What about kareem and khaled coming over next week?
I said wednesday.
No.
Next wednesday.
How are you not home.
I thought I was late.
Too big for your bag?
Which ones?
Buying new ones or ones I had?
Just make sure to keep electronics in hand luggage.
They do not go out of date...
B12?
Not really though, they have to put a date by law.
Jesus.
Of B12, right?
500ug?
Well, looks like I won't be dying this year.
Well, bigger number.
The amount you can actually absorb in a day is a tiny percentage of that.
Much better to have 7 100ugs in a week than 1 1000ug.
600 of any size was fine.
Good luck smuggling them on the plane.
They will think they have been contaminated with lsd or something.
No idea.
Medication you are allowed.
Need to read the rules.
Even if you just phone and ask them, then at least you have permission.
The airline customer service.
Get her a load of really thin ankle socks and she will be happy.
She will never ask for something though.
Yeah cables in the suitcase.
But not the new one.
Not really ankle socks, even short than them.
For wearing flat shoes.
She always needs them and never finds them.
Yeah, I think so.
Nah, they do not cover the top of the foot.
Let me try to find them.
This kind of thing.
"No show socks/invisible socks"
But I guess strong ones because her always wear away they are so thin.
If I send a load of empty messages, it is to hide those because she came home.
I will think.
Mariam.
They seem only interested in people smuggling things in suitcases.
And half of them are asleep.
I am waiting until the end of today so I can rest.
Yeah I think so.
How much is in there now?
How often?
Check.
Is she drinking loads of water?
Better to throw up water than your insides.
No idea.
200?
Well I am giving her 7000, so lets hope I get paid today.
Then we will have 2200ish.
Savings.
The what?
Who are they?
Yes.
Same person.
Next savings is a big holiday.
I remembered.
Three more classes? or terms?
No idea.
18thish to 28ish.
I mean, try.
Plenty of notice is key to holidays.
Okay
WHEN ARE YOU HOME
Tame eyes is waiting.
Ta5meyya what?
I did :D
Not crazy eyes.
The phone is beeping at me while it dies.
And the internet speed is still the same.
Okay fool time mmmm food and sleep.
I have eid holidays now.
For 9 days I think.
So prepare your fingers for extra talking.
Why?
Never too much.
My weekend it thursday and friday.
We only have three days off, saturday, sunday, and monday, but because so many people travel from outside cairo during the week, having a two day week is annoying for people.
So they worked an extra day last week, for two extra days off next week.
MY FAMILY IS SOON
minus my dad.
My family is in two.
It was good. I hope the dead sweap the lands and kill everyone.
And I hope jamie joins the gang.
Did you watch rick and morty yet?
You could have read it when you were sleepy or something.
Are you coming yet.
:/
Good morning.
How are you, I am having coffee.
nsfw
:/
The cat is massaging my belly and the other cat tried to step on me and it kicked the other one in the face.
What will we have?
I wish it was wearing socks though, it hurts.
The cat.
My stomach is sore and red.
Crazy eyes waited until the other one left and took its place.
But jesus his claws are too sharp.
Or is it order night.
Extra 150.
Hummous.
:D
The cat is scratching the spot on my chest.
I am bored already.
How are you?
Sure, but now I am awake.
I need a new game.
What is our phone & mobile number?
As a British person even reading the word dollar makes me angry.
Wait, I am trying to deal with dogshit internet.
Everything USA makes us angry.
Te data will phone you in the future. Not today.
I am complaining about the internet being too slow.
Our line can handle 6-8Mb/s right now.
And it has dropped to 1023Kb/s.
ticket no: 38320858
Aparrently someone will check the line exchange side, and might call to arrange someone meeting our side to check.
The exchange side should be within 2 working days.
And something about if they need to visit, they will call within 4 working days.
They might.
Unless I live in the USA, dollars are useless to me.
Pick any other stable currency if you are worried about devaluing egp.
How many people are staying in it...?
600 being the best does not mean it is not shit.
If there is any smoking in the place, I am out.
And I do not want to be with them.
No lets all go do this.
Lets all buy dinner together.
Crazy eyes had a crazy bath.
Are you coming home.
Happy Eid.
Good morning.
I am so sleepy.
I need so much coffee.
mar
You have to listen to these two.
We are going up north with NADA tonight.
These songs are the best though.
I hope your family does not bore you too much.
How much do you need?
You could do an international transfer to toka and she can withdraw.
Skips the comission part.
Can you?
Internet is still awful.
Someone is meant to be fixing it.
I am home.
Oh bring your 3ds so we can hack it and you can download any games for free.
We went to the north coast for three days.
Just got home a few hours ago.
It was fine.
A bit too sunny though.
Wake up.
Morrrrning.
I woke up at 12ish.
Just finished my morning joe.
I just realised the fan was not on.
Aparrently a few days.
The bike lock and slippers look handy.
I see no t-shirt.
That is the one.
My thick socks would be handy too.
The second thickest ones.
This will be easier when we can video call.
No, the internet.
Spinach I think.
Okay.
ARE YOU HERE
NO RICE
There was after all.
The cock who is responsible for booking at the hotel you picked is shit at their job and never checked whether it was possible.
There is this place which is stupidly cheap.
We can look at other ones at the same price and they will probably be nice.
But if you want half the price, it is possible.
I do not know, all I know is they never took a new reservation.
He is not taking reservations.
Or select B&B and Inns and sort by ranking.
It is too far away.
Look at Cairo Moon Hotel.
I do not see a price.
Also, this is in giza.
I am not traveling to giza everyday.
Something with a buffet is going to be bankrupting.
Giza is not even the same governate.
The pyramids are like a two hour journey away.
Yes.
Internet.
Send a link, my internet is too slow.
This is the one I sent you...
Internet is terrible.
Toka has no credit.
Can you book online?
Okay.
Two of my coworkers are coming around on thursday.
Are you fine?
I am. A little unenthusiastic, but coping.
I am writing a reddit backend.
What are you doing?
What did you try to draw?
Did you get mad?
Did you press way to hard?
This is crazy.
Why not put them all together.
Why not all of them? M
Hmmm.
Do you never show the bad ones?
Useless at everything?
In general, or right now?
I use you to talk to.
But you have an internship now.
Oh wow that was quick.
I might now.
I wonder what the other people there though about you.
Yeah, it is about money.
Everything.
The only way to get what you want is to convince them it will make money easier.
Or do my style and call literally everything dogshit.
But you tore it?
I think they are worth keeping.
Maybe.
After breakfast.
I am eating.
Hangouts.
Looks like it will be 391.5gbp for two singles and a double for 9 nights.
9004egp. We have not phoned yet though.
Actually, there are no single rooms avialable, but a room that holds 2 adults, and 2 children, but has a shared bathroom is the cheapest at 10gbp a night.
Shared bathroom, not room.
No idea how shared the bathroom is.
Arch is a bit slow when it comes to package updates is it not?
It feels like forever before linux and mesa get updated.
It is a hostel, you can not garentee you will get the full room, and there is only one room left.
It is downtown.
Kempinski Nile Hotel, 5 star, 4 adults imperial suite, 9 nights: 403,000egp.
************* in red: In high demand! Booked 53 times in the last 24 hours, only one room left!
Also, expect this.
Yeah, the photos seem to show good rooms and bad rooms.
Toka is phoning later.
I have made many many simple adapters.
Use a map, not people.
:/
Oh it is not.
Are you here.
A confirmation email was sent to:cmeredith71@gmail.com
Just linda's second name.
Okay.
The phone is not plugged in...
And your csv number on the card
Can I have your card details for the reservation?
My hotel has three rooms left of type (3 twin beds).
Your phone number.
No.
Names, your bank card details.
On the back, last three numbers
3 rooms cario moon hotel, 7600egp.
Payable when you arrive.
Expedia itinerary number: 7293704251698
Identity.
Just in case.
You have an expedia account now with points.
I just closed the tab and continued talking to myself.
With.
I think it has wifi too.
What should I eat.
Yeah.
Just over 300.
Having my hummmmouss.
I booked ages ago.
Yeah.
What do I eat now.
I had a loat.
Hmm, I am sleeping.
Yeah you sleep the night of the 27th, and leave the 28th.
Oh no.
There was no food yesterday.
And now there is double no food.
Fool.
Oh wow, I just did my first cryptography code.
I had the pinapple and coffee.
No we will buy it.
Do you know our tedata password for the internet? Is it in a notebook somewhere?
I found it.
I cleaned some.
They have aparrently left.
Their place.
He had trouble reaching khaled, who just said he is having car problems.
Like every excuse ever.
Are you hungry?
I want pizza.
Leave a man without his fool for a whole day, what else is to be expected :O
They will not come.
All the gin for us :D
The car.
I need pizza prompto.
Oh they live in a different city.
Not a surrounding Cairo city.
A two person party.
Leave in a shorter, faster bit and bring pizza.
The cat is sleeping with its toungue out.
Come in.
How is it up there?
Oh.
The first place we went was shit, but we moved to another place.
Going to bed soon.
And trying to find new music.
What is nice to you?
The stars do not change.
Good morning.
I am okay.
Is there no quiet there?
It was quiet where we were.
Is it busy?
Where are you?
No idea.
Are you reading a fake book?
Whoa, a terran conflict update in april this year.
Oh shit I remember building that.
Not sure if I finished.
Good idea.
Did you find any, or are you just playing?
It has controller support on linux now.
Is x4 good yet?
There is a sequel, x4 foundations.
Was that stuff not included in a community update version?
But was it an actual book?
What do you mean? I was a trader I think.
I get my new cpu soon, so elite might be in order.
The walking dead: season 1 is free on humble bundle right now.
Also monaco is free somewhere.
That rpg game a while ago that got really good reviews.
But had awful performance on my computer.
I think the publisher of that released a new rpg game that looks worse and requires a minimum of 6GiB of ram.
Tyranny.
I was just guessing the publisher.
Paradox and obsidian.
I am excited to be able to play 100% more games.
Oh wow, I can not have that on my work screen.
Getting close now!
Oh wow, I forgot how slow a hdd makes a computer.
Are you going to transfer 20 or something to test first?
Actually, might be a waste of 10 pound.
Okay.
Shit.
I took the thing.
You know the focus changing shortcuts?
alt + h for anticlockwise, alt + c for clockwise, control + alt + c for close.
But on my layout.
No, but had coffee.
Finally getting to explore iOS :D
Mmmmm fooool.
What did you do at home?
I sneezed.
Oh not yet.
Did you?
Better than your parents'?
You gave a resignation?
This is what happens when you have 10000 people in a chain.
Where is it.
Ask for a copy of your resignation letter.
And when they have nothing ask how they know. 
Then complain about that person for submiting a resignation on your behalf.
Hi.
I had an eggplant.
It is good but I think your parents make them completely differently.
She is keeping the secret recipe to herself.
She probably has it hidden in that big bag she carried around.
Hahaha a protest?
Sorry, strike.
Just make sure others will too.
It is only effective if lots of people do.
Jesus, have you seen this?
Also, do you even have a demand?
Pfft you were just paid.
Spend some time finding a good job.
Did you sign a contract?
Your call.
But six days still.
Any job you get next has to be 5 or less, and 40 hours a week or less.
days
Besa seems so long ago now.
Are you home yet?
An aeroplane just flew super low over us.
Stuart.
Wait.
That looks like Mr Barcly.
Mr Barnetson?
Where are you.
Where is that?
You were invited?
Sure say hi.
They might think I am dead.
Quick I just started fool.
More at the firework in our neighbourhood.
How did it go?
Did they forget you?
I am up now.
Making coffee.
Hahahaha.
WHY IS PAUK GETTING VOICE MESSAGES AND NOT ME
I have to cycle to work, I will be back in twenty minutes.
Phone someone.
I am here.
Are you sure it sent?
Yeah
. Maybe it is big and is still sending.
Now it is downloading.
Are you emotional Mariam?
I will find a song to put this to.
<3<3<3<3
I am going to cry at work.
This is my favourite voice note.
I can not believe I get to listen to this.
I had fool, ta3meya, and misa2a at work.
You went to bed early, but you woke up twelve hours later?
Hahahaha
Valid point, the bullets can hurt people.
But funny.
I was sleeping around 11~12 hours during the holidays.
Do you remember my coffee tomato?
Yeah, I know. I tried and I see it on toka's.
Hahahaha.
Oh man my jokes.
I need a slow song but not sad.
I think I found the one.
Although, I wish the song was around six minutes.
Come in.
I sent an email.
Oh it is taking forever.
I think you leave it like this.
Did you get the email?
It says it still did not send.
I will have to look.
But hold on, work.
Jesus.
Cerah - From The Quiet
I transcribed it so I can read along and not miss a thing when I listen to it.
What does your painting say?
The internet is so bad today.
Why did you pick it?
Do you think we talk less?
Words or media?
It is often hard to find a time we are both here and not busy.
Okay check.
How is your day?
Are you ready to search for the perfect job?
I love you.
Still have not played any of the games.
What was it?
Different builds can play the games very different, would you play it again?
Also, what? Dark souls 3?
When did that come out?
I am still waiting to be able to play games like morrowind.
Will probably be able to play dark souls on windows.
Are you home.
All I have to go by is that irish guy.
** That would be decently decent.
Happened in 1921 in the uk, and never since.
The USA, france, spain seems to repeat their mistakes.
Hi.
Baaaaby.
Saba7 el moooooooooorning <3
Wake up
That seems a bit odd.
There is usually lots.
Harvest hahaha.
Just add the rss feed.
Uh oh.
When do you have to leave?
192.168.1.1
admin `ihavearedcarpet`
How are you?
Oh wow.
We will never get 16.
6-8 max I think.
That is 3.2
The minimum is 4.
Well, at least he is improving things.
A man came to our house and increased the speed.
He said next month our place will get fiber and increase to 16mb/s.
I keep listening to the note all the time.
Yeah.
That is good right?
You can just tell her your schedule and see if she can work around it.
Or ask if she can wait a month.
How hot is it?
It was 140 for 2mb/s and 140GiB a month, with a throttling speed of 512kb/s after that.
Now it is 260 for up to 16mb/s and 200GiB a month, with throttling of 2mb/s after that.
So even if we go over 200GiB, we get unlimited at the old speed.
50C?
What do I eat today?
I am so sleepy and tired at work today.
When are we goint to meet again.
Hmmm.
No.
I think I have too.
But I am so weak today.
1220000036201501928
Is this the internation account number?
Did you not get a special card with your info on it?
When I sent money to you.
Yeah.
Maybe phoning them and asking for the details you need to recieve an international transfer.
I think you had a card though.
Like a peice of paper.
Just ordered a 1.17gbp tiny adapter thing.
Why?
Baaaaby.
I am home.
I am home.
WHO WAS LISTENING TO SAD EMOTIONAL MELANCHOLIC GOTHIC RELAXING DARK PIANO MUSIC
It is really hot today.
Okay I will accept this. I love you too.
Crazyeyes has been renamed to lazyeyes.
Oh wow.
Your's just goes sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhh-plop-ssssssssssssssssh.
Gogogo check.
When are you home today?
I am so hungry but also so lazy.
Seems wrong it is so cheap.
With free delivery.
What the living fuck.
I just realised my hd598s has a detachable cable.
Never too cheesy, just the wrong cheese.
Nah, these are the basic cheeses.
I feel like if you wrote it before and checked, it would come out like a recital and not as natural.
How can you take the parts?
I am so happy.
But there is no feast coming up.
Yeah.
The uk has great delivery times.
But if not, it was only 1.17.
I think it would be best to give them notice that this is the last month.
And recieve the pay as usual.
Well, you can tell them you want to quit, and you want to finish when you take the holidays.
They might say okay.
I have two work stories that are good but waiting until you come home.
Not related to my employment, just work stories.
Well, they owe you no holiday pay anyway.
6 continuous months before you can have paid days off.
Unless you work for another company during those days off.
As long as they pay you for the days you worked this month, which they should because you left formally.
Oh wow, is it because of my killer microphone quality?
No you are.
Yes, confirmed beautiful <3
This is my sneezy face.
Toka does not know the number yet.
I guess she will phone the bank or have a look.
Cat hairs probably.
I woke up needing anti-histamine, but I still have not taken one.
I also need to get food but I am lazy.
No these are international numbers.
Cats.
We have a huge bag of dry food.
It might be her brothers.
I do not remember.
Are you ready for my best english voice to date?
The small bags were 35-45egp for 1kg I think.
But we got a 16kg bag for 320egp last time.
We actually just ran out after a long number of months.
We will need to go tomorrow.
I think you should leave within a month, with notice.
I think you could cope, but I think you should be in a closer place with fewer hours.
You always find something.
Just too quick to choose.
Nope, besa was worse.
I recommend you give notice you plan to leave, and see what they say.
They may want you to stay to the end of the month, they may not care, they may tell you not to come in tomorrow.
I think you will be fine finding a new job that is hopefully better.
They are more expensive than me olmost.
Hey.
I will go for food now.
Come back.
I got food.
The fool place had good people there.
And the guy gave me the specialist treatment.
Took my order and told the guy the way we like it.
HAPPY ENGAGEMENT ANIVERSARY
I ordered 15 fool and he told the guy itneen w itneen.
And the guy just stared at him.
Did you sleep.
Jesus, the 32GiB samsung pro microsd card is at 24gbp.
Oh wait, it was when I bought it too.
I thought it was 30.
She will call today at work.
Ordered one more item before it is too late.
Hold on we want her to transfer to my account so we have pounds, right?
Yeah our ping at work is 50ish% slow than ours.
Yeah it I am super excited.
A new computer comes once every 3 years or so.
3* better than christmas :D
You can just transfer to my bank account.
The gbp is more stable and it gives us the chance to convert our savings in egp.
We have a lot of egp.
45,000 or something.
Yeah.
Just make sure I do not spend it.
The only thing I buy is the lost.host domain renewal.
But I have that for three years now.
By listening to my voice note.
Yeah.
Okay.
Just because of the name?
Toca is a weird name.
We have had breakfast each day this week so I am fine.
WHEN IS COMPUTERISTMAS?
Hi mariam, wake up.
SHARING MOVIES BETWEEN US AT 120MiB A SECOND
Lots of passengers?
Jeez.
The Englishness was too much for you.
What are the other stats?
I keep forgetting you can only use one of each.
Life is hard without gazelle.
Okay.
Well, it is always likely.
WHY NOT
Just russian haha
Nope.
Sometime an irish.
Or a bad scottish one.
Okay when I remember and have the microphone.
How are you today?
Which sister?
Hla goes to school now?
Nada just started school?
Waiting for the signal.
I should take 500? Did we have something else to do too?
:D
Where are you.
Did you get the email.
Leaving?
Do you have internet to message me when to leave?
Okay.
Jesus
Also, has Gibraltar imploded yet?
I had a dream that you asked me the question, "If you could eat anyone and then give birth to them, who would it be?"
It is Scottish English, Doric, but I do not use words that are not English.
Why did you cry.
Which thoughts.
I want to know the many.
I do not want you to be alone with the thoughts.
They make you cry.
Oh god it is so hot.
I think it will happen when general artificial intelligence exists.
Once intelligence is digitial, lots of things become possible for the people.
But that is a sidetrack.
Well the person is just code on a computer, upgrades and modifications are possible.
Also whole worlds can be made to live in instead of reality.
SIDETRACK
I think so but I will wait for the thoughts when you are ready.
In my dream I thought a little about who I would eat.
I thought maybe because you asked it you would hope it would be you.
But I thought I would not pick you because I do not want to change you and for you to be different.
You would be a baby.
That seems like a really weird thing to want.
A child, maybe.
What will you paint?
Hey, did you stop being aware of the conversation?
Well, you can go, get the offer, then tell them you will think about it and tell them.
You did it. You managed to stop being aware of everything.
I am home.
That banging cv gets you all the jobs.
Did you apply for any today?
Does everyone sit down all day?
To my british account, right?
If you do not spend all the 900gbp worth, I can just send you back the amount when you go home.
Come in.
What are you doing today?
Yeah, well you can just transfer more when you get home and we can give you more.
There is no worries.
I think 300-500ish so 15-25 pound.
But I forgot.
We will find out when we get there.
The shit.
It is a different color.
The shit.
Too early to call.
Is it sleep time yet?
Breakfast, some date things, coffee.
Okay hold on.
I am waiting on foooooooooooooooooooooooooooool to defrost.
OH
Guess what I thought of.
BITENGENEGNH
The nhs says to carry medication in hand luggage.
I think there is no restrictions because it is not a controlled medicine.
But they might think it is drugs.
So just keep them sealed.
The B12.
Yeah, but I just wrote hand luggage.
How do they know?
And how do they know you have not changed the pills with ecstasy and are hiding them in your suitcase?
Going through an x-ray machine and 600 little round things pop up is suspicious.
Take the ssd in hand luggage.
An x-ray does not show them the label.
The vertex.
Also, the network switch is in hand luggage.
Before you pack, video call me.
Did they say why?
I opened slack and all I had was a message from magdy saying "sounds good".
Marrrrrrrriammmmmmmm.
They should be in the freezer.
The more layers they have the better they are for freezing.
Were you pretending to be the health inspector?
Today?
I woke up.
They are good.
Yeah.
One more thing to hopefully arrive.
That cable looks good right?
Baaaby.
Oh I need waaaaaaateeeeeeeeeer.
approved...?
Dear Toka, we are sorry to hear you are leaving. We hope the best for you in your future.
When did you get back home?
What are you doing today?
Today I do nothing.
Which is my favourite thing to do.
Oh, I doubt they will accept that.
They do not usually keep money in the company.
That loaning part is really dodgy.
You can ask him.
But I would not push it.
And I would not expect it to happen no matter what he says.
This is one of my favourite paintings.
If you look closely there are lots of little animals.
I need my coffee and water.
How long did you sleep?
Also minecraft on the 3DS...
Nah the pocket edition at first must have been the worst.
It was 256x256 map size and had fuck all.
And no buttons.
Are their sales running dry? Why do they need to keep expanding?
What is the best game made by ubisoft?
That was my guess.
Getting a list now.
The original far cry was pretty good I think.
TrackMania Turbo...?
Grow home, child of light, the south park games recently, trails fusion, the smurfs 2, trails evolution, hamsterz life 2, just dance kids, SCI; NY, Imagine: Babyz, Catz 5, Morrowind, **Jade cocoon 2** I liked that one, .
I closed it now, but just on consoles, right?
ZombiU was a remake.
I finally made coffee.
These are the metapixels.
Interesting. Our internet is connected on the old settings again.
Did your dad have the operation?
Is he fine?
When is it?
And you can only visit until 5pm?
Seems weird he has to wake up to no one he knows.
Where are you.
Well I hope the operation goes well and it helps is back.
Who has super clean feat.
Hot feet.
When your feet are your feat.
Do you know where the 3ds is?
Yeah it was covered.
Boxes.
When are you home today?
When did you leave today?
Why.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, not yet.
But it takes an hour or two.
Mine is not a bank.
Outside the supermarket or our building?
It transferred fine.
Where are you.
`lrzcat bee-out.lrz`
After installing lrzip
Oh, it refuses to print to stdout, `lrzcat -f bee-out.lrz`
For the bee movie script.
4.7GiB.
Ram?
Seems odd.
I have no problems on my nuc.
It is just cating text to stdout after decompression.
Nothing that should lock a computer up.
lrzip using zpaq is beastly at compression.
beats xz -9 -e by a lot.
Hello.
We are off to toka's parents' house.
Nothing probably.
We will buy things you need when you get here.
Ah, we need to google restrictions on that.
It is illegal to bring potatoes, meat, meat products, or milk and dairy products from outside the EU to the UK.
Leaving the UK, the restrictions do not apply.
The game?
I would change the graphics to low if it is laggy.
Once you feel confident, we can play together.
It is a crad collection game too.
It looks like you have not been reading during the tutorial.
That is your "action points", but they call it something else.
The cards have a number on them.
That is how much they cost to use.
You are playing the tutorial missions right?
Though, when I went, they asked if I had any laptops, and I said no but I have 100 different other electronic stuff. They said nah.
This is travelling back to the UK from Egypt, you will have to put laptops and phones in the suitcase.
Well the first six are real basic.
When do you sleep?
I can probably play tonight for a bit, but after all this cleaning is finished.
Jesus.
You better be practicing, otherwise I will destroy you.
I am home.
Our internet is okay right now.
For the first day this month.
3100kb/s
How fast are you?
Enough to send me videos!
What level are you?
Have you opened new packs?
With new cards.
Thag?
Shall we play a game?
Add me as a friend when you finish: pualth
Divinity original sin 2 is out.
The graphics look ballin'.
Exicited for that.
nada.h.h?
Yeah I can not find you.
Try meutraa
Hold on noodle time.
I did not get your friend invite.
You press shift tab in game.
It will bring up an overlay.
Are you adding me in the game, or on steam?
Well, add me on steam.
The taskbar, it is there.
What was your steam user name?
Did you verify the email?
Click view steam support for more info.
Pfft forget that then, I will add you in game.
Yes.
Bring it up again.
New strategy incoming.
Best of three.
I want to go level and get some cards.
Just going to earn some stuff and do quests.
Maybe another game in a bit.
Ah I will leave it for tonight.
I am level 13 now.
I expect the same from you tomorrow.
Missions or matches, or pretty much anything.
You should read and not skip tutorial instructions.
Baaaaby.
I can not update this computer without an apple account.
And I need a card linked to my account for that :/
Yeah.
This is my computer.
God knows what apple sends from it.
It should only have my accounts on it.
I have a card. I just never remember to take it.
Could you get it from the sock draw?
No, just the number and csv code.
And the expiry date.
Then delete the messages.
Yeah.
Last three numbers on the back.
Okay delete them.
THANKS
Now it is officially soon.
I suppose the smallest bottle of orange and barly, and blackcurrent and apple robinsons.
Liquids go in luggage though.
I forgot the brand of the best potato scones.
One pack of those thick triangle oatcakes, mummy should know which ones.
Could you run `pass | grep -C3 discord`?
Actually.
`cd ~/.password-store; git push origin master
Without the ~
NO
Without the `
Riot used to let you edit messages.
heavily vanquish sudoku self chatter enrage impart
`cd ~/.password-store; git pull origin master; git push origin master`
But in between that it will probably open a text editor.
In which case press `:`, type `wq`, and press enter.
That is it.
Yes.
THANKS
Sounds boring.
pantheon-photos
170,000egp is the price of an app.
Also dokki and I am none of those.
C++ coding...
They want someone who can write embedded C++.
To program little devices with sensors.
That kind of job you would be looking at 12k+ a month.
That is assembly work.
"; and"
Probably be my stuff?
Hello.
I ar fine.
How ar you?
Only consider anything if they reduce your working hours and make it five days a week with a regular schedule.
Without a pay reduction.
And you know your other complaints.
Come back.
When are you home today.
I am home.
Guess who has a new employment agreeement.
How did your metting go.
I mean yeah, you want to leave, but if they offered you 10,000 a month, obviously you would consider it.
I got the monitor power cable.
And I now work from 11am to 5:30pm.
Now I have plenty of time to have a life during the week.
My work is changing to different tasks, and there is a story but when you get home.
He offered 5500, but I suggested 6.5 hours a day instead.
What is your level?
His offer was a 22% pay rise, and mine was a 15%. But I like time, and the further my salary is from every one elses, the more he will be hesitant to move it.
ARE YOU HAPPY FOR ME
Okay, after I eat and clean myself we can call.
From where?
An extracuricular activity?
Interviews seem a little formal for a club.
Is it "Board Games" with Moss?
"Boooooooreeeeeed"
Nah, I am eating and cleaning.
Got me this far.
Oh wow, hungry cats ate every last thing.
Okay, send a message when you get home.
Has linda changed her name?
Okay, I am not ready.
Yeah.
Per hour, yes.
4500.
My hourly wage is...
33ish.
What, no. I get paid by the month.
I told you my hourly rate because my monthly rate did not change.
My hourly rate did, because I work fewer hours.
But I work the same number of months.
No, I get paid the same per month for fewer hours, so my hourly went up.
You said I get more per month for fewer hours.
I worked 157.5 hours a month before for 4500.
Now I work 136.5 hours for 4500.
Come in Mariam.
He was explaining the new roles Eslam, Ahmed, and I would have.
And after it all, I said, "Buuut, that sounds like a load of stuff I do not want to do" and Eslam laughed.
So negotations started and he made the offer that I do it for a month and if I am good at it the offer will apply.
And I said I am not going to work doing something I do not like as much for the same pay for a month to find out I will not do it.
So it became a week, and then I suggested 6.5 hours, starting tomorrow.
I told him I was getting old and tired.
Yeah I brought that up.
He asked if it was this month, I said tuesday haha.
I agreed that I would be on slack for 3 hours each day early morning or late night, and that way I have all the days not at work.
I think seven days total off.
10 minutes.
I lied.
I will be ready when I am ready. Deal with it.
Have you taken anything?
When do you take them?
Can we voice chat while playing?
Where are you.
Nah, I have work.
Okay give me five minutes.
Hold on.
No.
My mum is packing all the stuff.
When are you home.
Nah, using hangouts.
No. Why.
BE FINE
Be home.
I love you <3
I have a soundcloud again.
Tiny rucksack.
How is your head?
Is it a rain cloud?
The lid looks odd.
It looks too big.
Yeah it does look nice.
Maybe a bit small though.
What is that?
No.
Maybe.
It reminds me of a song but I do not know it right now.
I wanted to find some new folky songs.
Anchor by whom?
I found it.
Everything by Novo Amor is perfect.
Are you ever home.
Toka is still not home :/
Where.
Bring noodle or something.
How long.
Jesus.
Nope.
Firesong
I now work from 11am to 5:30pm.
But I am going to bed now.
The first boss king yaknus is insane.
What.
Ms mariam is leaving.
OH
Did you applay?
Good morning.
Oh wow.
Go blow them away.
Nah do not worry about them.
I replied.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
3 rooms cario moon hotel, 7600egp.Payable when you arrive.Expedia itinerary number: 7293704251698
The number is there.
No clothes.
Maybe some george/whatever boxer breifs.
As long as they look tight and comfortable.
Nah nothing else.
I showed mummy the type of socks she uses.
The important part is the quality of them though.
So they last a while and not a couple of weeks.
Hmmm.
cmeredith71@gmail.com
:D
The booking is confirmed on the phone.
I have no idea, a 6 or 7.
For socks?
What level are you?
That is a direct link to a 750MiB file, beware.
I went to bed and beat my 150 line speed record in tetris.
When you unzip android studio and run it it will walk you through downloading the rest of the android stuff.
The android sdk 26, build tools, platform tools, haxm, google repository, support repository, etc.
I think it is around another 900MiB.
Then you can start a new project and have zero clue what anything means :D
I woke up.
Wake up.
I have had my four poops today already.
Got a 326,000 starting level 1 marathon.
And a 150 line in 6 minutes 4 second.
Mooooooooorning.
What will you do today?
DID YOU KNOW THAT BIRO NOT ONLY MAKE PENS BUT ALSO DOMINATES THE LIGHTER MARKET
The documentary we watch on Bic.
Biro is a pen too.
Jeez these 6.5 hours are feeling like forever this week.
What are you doing?
OI
Are you ready to go through hell?
I think your parents will make you very unhappy for a few months.
What is the second decision?
I mean, it is going to be really difficult, but the only thing I can suggest to make it a bit better is being straight forward with them.
And because they are never going to think you are right, just listening to them, and ignoring it.
Everything everything?
I was going to say, they will lock you in an insane asylum.
Feeding you pills each day.
riot.lost.host
Or paul.lost.host
Or toka.lost.host
Pick one.
They may blame toka.
Dealing with my parents is very different. If they get mad at me, only they lose; I do not care because I do what I believe to be right.
But dealing with your parents is completely different.
If being yourself makes them angry or dissapointed, I would hate them.
By when?
Jeez.
What is it?
Date and responsibilities?
And what was your education score? And when did it finish?
What is your degree title?
BA of what?
What is your course title?
For example my degree was a BSc in Mathematical Physics. Toka's was a BA in English Literature or something.
A little worrying that you do not know what you are working towards for four years.
Departments are just groups of people in a building.
When you graduate you get a degree, with a title.
If you do not get a degree with a title, you have no degree.
The name of that degree, and that peice of paper is the entire reason you study for four years.
You said that is the department name.
It is a little awkward being on two pages like that.
Are you ready for some faeria?
Who are you.
What?
Coooooooooooooooome.
ONE DAY
Oh yeah.
Yeah, we will tell you what the plan is and you can pick things you want to do.
Orange fruit and barley.
And blackcurrent and apple.
Just the small bottles.
Just over a month now.
As long as you fall asleep the same number of times as wake up I am okay.
Well I came home and now I am waiting for toka to be here so I can eat.
I am very hungry.
She should be here soon.
What will you do?
Where are you.
We need carrots and kosa.
No we have kosa.
Do you pass a place?
Okay.
I am so hungry though.
I skipped two breakfast offers this morning.
Why would they?
It is not illegal.
If they ask why you are taking it in hand luggage, say it is expensive and you do not trust the handlers on the egyptian side.
I really doubt it, let me google cases like that
Just phone up already and ask about all the times.
items
I took a crap tonne of electronics in my backpack to egypt.
Too many sisters.
Why are they not cleaning themselves?
What?
Yeah.
Maybe.
The airline customer service more likely.
My mum is coming tomorrow.
Nada is on facebook LIVE and we are watching her.
No, it is the normal speed again.
Who knows.
I think we will complain again and just revert back to the old plan.
Then wait for the improvements.
I already did.
Robinsons and the thick triangle oat cakes.
Fake cheese?
Just surpise me.
I just want her to know what the food I always talk about is.
Come play faeria.
You leave tomorrow night?
I am working tomorrow too.
Prepare yourself for the shittiest shower.
For what?
What is your phone?
Next time get a phone with a microsd card slot.
The number one problem I see all apple users have is a cracked screen and no storage space.
It has glass both sides, like the iphone 4 or whatever.
The iphone x looks nice, but iOS is still unusable.
I woke up.
Well I did say to phone the airline customer service
Good morning.
Yeah that is just the size restrictions.
I think they will not care.
118cm is huge.
I am just about to leave.
Is it over?
Putting on socks.
What happened?
They failed?
Never have your phone in public
Nah, a thin jumper at most.
But I doubt even a jumper.
What happened.
Yeah do not work 6 days.
You should always refuse to tell them your current pay.
Just say you think that is irrelevant.
What happened with the phone?
Jesus.
I will stop messaging you when you are outside.
Toka says to bring a jumper.
Will you not take it out anymore?
40 in the day, 23 at night.
Are you fine?
I love you.
SOON
No you love me now!
Sure.
But there is coffee here.
Coffee for yourself?
We have a load of instant coffee we never use.
And we can give you a pot to cook actual coffee in.
Yeah it was.
How are you today?
Yeah.
I am good.
I have 4 more hours until my holidays.
And they are here tomorrow!
Yes.
9 days I think.
I think so yes.
I think you can take anything.
But I have no toaster or spread.
Because they do not have loafs of bread or soya spread.
When are you leaving?
Well, that is me finished work.
Kind of, I will work 3 hours a day from home.
Well yeah, but very flexible, and from home.
Well, cairo does not cater for the tired.
A plane full of egyptians, good luck.
Baaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Are you fine.
Is it faeria day?
Mariam, hi.
My mum and sister are leaving tonight.
We do but they are pita bread things.
No but you can have corn flakes.
We will go food shopping tomorrow night.
Chocolate is very very expensive.
It has to be stored in fridges.
Chocolate biscuits, sure.
But chocolate bars are more than gold.
Also chocolate cornflakes are fine.
The bosses in this game are insane.
Are you sure?
There is a ban on potatoes coming into the EU.
But the UK sets no food restrictions going out.
Any bans would have to be from the Egypt side.
Oh is there, a question.
Left germany yet?
We just woke up.
What are you talking about hats for?
No problems in aberdeen?
No I was blue.
That is a joke right.
This is a joke right.
What got confiscated?
Jesus christ, you are sleeping on the floor now.
A diet of solely bread sticks.
The arrival terminal in Cairo is not listed on your booking sheet.
Do you have any idea which one it is?
I think it is terminal 3.
Your flight is meant to leave in 30 minutes and you are still not boarded?
I think it is fine. We should be outside the terminal 3 at 2:10 waiting for you.
You may be up to an hour inside because Egyptians are spazzes.
We are super excited.
Just having breakfast then leaving to go to the bank.
Cherio.
Yeah :(
Do you write in markdown now?
I write markdown a lot but I never use it in chat.
I use it for code formatting and password mostly.
Over chat.
Yeah we got home just now.
I can bring 1 adapter I think.
But we might have to get another one because you have lots of phones.
Hello.
I have my new computer set up.
It is fast.
Jesus, have you been awake since 5:30?
Hi.
They are fine.
My sister is here with us, but still sleeping.
How are you?
We are waiting for lisa to wake up.
Nope.
Once we have decided what we are doing today.
Well, I think the north coast superceeds the swimming pool here.
But we can talk today.
Yeah,
Shall I call?
Yeah.

We are putting on our shoes now.
Hopfully there by 1:30.
We got back late.
Is it releasing on the wii u?
Yeah, but I have to do a little work from home each day.
Oh, if you guys have photos of nada without her hijab, make sure not to post them anywhere.
That is us all up now.
Toka is booking the taxi in a minute.
What is it?
The graphics power is kind of blowing me away on this.
Well, I suppose the cpu is also way better.
Booking now.
3 minutes away.
You should go down.
Well, I do not have windows.
Nice.
Downloading stuff is taking ages.
The app says 42-48 pound.
But I suspect it will be more.
You got to the hotel fine?
You underpaid this morning on the taxi, it was 42, so you paid that back tonight.
Yeah halawa.
Hi mariam.
Things are super busy and you are the best and I miss you and do not forget me.
We are all awake now too.
No.
Okay.
Yeah, it was not far but 2 seems stupid.
We just got home.
Going to the north coast for three days.
Rocket league plays fine at high settings at 1080p. 
Not sure of the frame rate.
But it can not be less than 30.
I do not notice lag.
Probably shitty drivers.
I would have thought your gpu would have no problem at 4k.
I hope you are fine and everything is perfect with you.
<3
We will try to be there by 8am tomorrow.
We are up and getting ready.
A little one yeah.
Do not worry.
Mariam.
I love you.
That is all.
Be fine.
<3
I am the happiest we know each other.
I probably do not express it but you mean so much to me.
Tell me in words because you are better than me at expressing.
I am at the north coast.
Be here.
Please meet meet me again.
Double meet.
Are you guys home fine?
But is mummy still alive?
I am back now.
Jesus gary.
Come in.
Not talk for 6 years.
I got a new nuc and keyboard.
Anyway, 
No, a nuc.
Cairo is ass as always.
Mariam mariam mariam.
Is this a joke?
yalla?
Are you awake?
I woke up.
Are you fine?
Baby pc with a samsung 960 pro 512GiB nvme pci-e and an iris 640.
No plans currently.
Plans for a holiday to south korea next year though.
Do not talk to me before my morning joe.
We will book the taxi for 12:30.
Jesus.
Also ask about the price.
Say you need to know how much money to take.
Hi.
We just got back too.
I am fine. I j;st got home.
Are we meeting this friday?
Looks like the fighting has started at nada's too now.
The whole concert and gay stuff.
No idea, probably not more than 50. 
I forgot about a load of savings we have here so 
2000 is fine.
I think so.
Remember when we made two piles and made me hold both, I think we must have switched the piles.
150gbp spending is about 4000, which is in this pile. 
So I think you or lisa must have got the 4x00 pile for rent.
750 short on rent.
Okay message me when you make it more certain.
There is 
4000 here and the total is 3800+950.
Tomorrow we will go to Cairo tower and a market.
Khali something.
Just for my mum and aunt really.
I miss you.
Could you meet us at the metro station entrance we went in last time?
Not sure what time yet.
It is fine, we can meet you tomorrow morning at the place, we have to pay the rent anyway.
I have been awake since half six.
When do you want to meet?
Nils frahm is one of my favourites.
Nils Frahm did the soundtrack of the movie victoria.
Okay, give us a message when you are leaving in the morning and we will leave too.
For free? We just got back now.
I finally got a little clock for my keyring.
Yeah it fit fine.
Yes, I really like it.
Me too.
Yeah, I suppose so. Been super tired.
We will leave at about half ten but we are stopping by nada on the way so we may not be there until just past 11.
Today is done.
I am ill and so nackered.
My sister came across with an ilness and me and nada got it.
We took the cat to the groomer for a hair shaving and a super wash.
How are you Mariam.
It has been forever we have not spoke for.
Come in, wake up, be home.
When did steamworld 2 come out. 
Have you tried fresh dates?
They are like apples but taste like dates.
Without gg, I am nothing.
I mean the crunchy inside and juiciness.
They leave that grippy feeling in your mouth though.
Like spinach.
They are home fine now.
How can you just wake up at 2am.
Hey toka needs to show you crazy eyes.
It is 84gbp.
She said she already sent the picture.
Yeah that is fine.
He is second best in the world.
Rude
Jeez they must think egypt is a bomb site.
A bit noisy.
I think I can.
When?
I think that bus stops around Royal house.
I do not know which bus takes me home though.
Toka went to the hospital.
Her dad.
I went yesterday with he
There is no metro near here.
But I want to meet you.
It will just have to be past 6pm. 
How would you have got to korba?
Could you sent me co-ordinates of the place?
I might be able to walk that.
It is only 6.3km.
Could you not take a tax to city stars
Or a park.
We have to find a better place to meet anyway.
Oh wow, my cycle to work is 58m uphill. 
Will you send you instead?
Oh I remembered we have samboooosa.
Okay, I will give it a few hours first.
Yeah I feel awful, at least my nose has stopped running so much today.
Now is the coughing.
Toka's dad had his spine operation.
We saw him yesterday, he seems okay, high on drugs probably.
But the doctor never said how the operation went yet.
WHAT IS THIS
Did you even check to see if I had had my morning joe yet?
So rude.
A movie was made about us?
Yeah, a little.
How is your dad?
Did any doctors say anything?
You mean just by the appearance, right?
Is he moving around?
Spoiler: the operation was cancelled last minute.
I spent ages organising all our data now.
Since we have two computers and three drives
Hi.
Are you back yet?
Hello.
All bunged up.
I have taken stuff.
I hope I am better tomorrow because I have work.
You never sent you.
I should have lots of me soon, but the photos are not with me yet.
I woke up.
Are you awake?
I think not.
I need linux game recommendations.
Maybe something I missed because my pc was too slow.
I am thinking about pillars of eternity.
I played a tomb raider game on your pc I think.
I will buy insurgency.
Can you try to change the internet today?
Well it is not me.
With the island...?
It is not the newest one.
Fuck them for dropping numbers for the game names.
It is just becoming a shittier version of the male game they make.
Playing it, I am at work.
She must be on my pc.
She does not have a steam account.
Who knows.
Uncharted.
Seems like the male tomb raider game to me.
Tomb raider seems to have lost its style and just become a clone of uncharted, but worse.
You do that in uncharted.
True.
They seem to be adding gameplay mechanics for no real reason.
I want mystery and history.
And puzzles.
Yeah.
I am fine, just blowing my nose a lot.
140 pound, 140gb, 2mb/s
megabit
ish
The sink is fine.
Nah blowing in the sink is better for my nose.
Oh I am at work now, I will check when I get home.
The change of diet really messes with your poo for a while.
What?
Just at work.
WHA
For how long?
The only thing stopping that is Jamie.
Train her to poop in the bathroom.
Jamie would let you come indefinetly?
Jeez, the only reason I am here is toka.
Yeah but working is many months.
My work is pretty great.
I have so much control and freedom, doing stuff I feel at home with.
It is a short cycle, and I only work 6.5 hours a day now.
I probably will not be able to get time off work this time in march though.
I have had so many days off already.
But I do not work much, so you can just play games while I am away.
And clean cat poop.
:/
I want samboosa.
Also a bicycle pump.
It is pretty urgent.
Hmmmmm.
I have no money on me.
I think sambousa is okay for when I get home, then we can roast vegetable it up later on.
Yeah, we can take a market trip later.
<3
Okay.
Keyboard is working exactly as it should without any configuration on mac :D
They liked it.
The smallest they have seen, obviously.
Soon.
Five minutes
No idea when they do.
I started in April.
But honestly, he pays me more than he should.
He pays me a salary, so even if I am off for whatever reason, I still get the same.
But not really a salary because if I work more, he pays me extra.
I think everyone else gets paid for the number of hours they work.
I am the most reliable one here though.
I am always at work.
I can probably download life is strange for windows.
Shit it is 13GiB.
I am home.
Now I have 999.49.
When do you sleep these days.
It feels like you are never here.
Jesus, btn got disabled.
Today.
I used it this morning.
I got our gg account back.
It was because of ips.
I added the server in france to the vpn staff approved ip.
But we are going to have to both use it if we want to share.
I suspect btn just did the same today.
Btn, no idea yet.
gg: went into irc and bluffed my way through.
never knew currfyg@gmail.com was an email address.
So that looked iffy.
It is the site log I think they use to spot it.
Yeah, I am still seeding.
I will have to do the same for btn, the mod of gg might be connected.
How much do you use them all?
We could share my vpn and just be carefull not to not use it.
Or have a dedicated browser for trackers, which uses a proxy.
They would shit themselves if you accessed it through tor.
Assuming people must have only local computers is dumb.
Oh yeah even that.
If sending torrent files works, that would be easy.
Not sure if they monitor torrent traffic too, because seedboxes do not count as vpns.
Getting steamworld dig 2 now. 
Have you learnt anything on your keyboard yet?
The steamworld dig .sh file is 50m, the install sh file.
Not yet.
It was in an iso, in split rars, at 200m. 
They are working on it though.
Next year.
I usually just call up your mother.
I just work up now.
Less pain but just as annoying.
UH OH
pantheon-photos
Some of your scanned photos I think.
There may be duplicates, I am not sure.
Also I think all the raw versions have jpg versions too.
But I think it manages that for you.
HEY SOHA
What a busy period.
Are you fine?
Are you a new person?
Hmmmmmmmmmm
Okay.
I have steamworld dig.
But bring back something.
Remember the peppers.
I only got it once.
What are the work issues?
I now work from 10:30 to 5pm.
Yeah, I am now the android team manager / support guy.
I am trying to make it so everyone gets a chance to use new libraries and things in projects.
How far do you travel now?
Was magdsoft better to work at?
I moved back into the other room and it is just me, kareem, and eslam in here now.
I do miss you being here.
Only if you manage everything.
I will pump out code.
I just like writing code and helping people improve.
Although, maybe not writing Java is a blessing.
Currently I am not writing any code.
But any time I do, I use kotlin mostly.
:D
I like kotlin because it allows your to be creative.
But I also hate kotlin.
If java is a 2, kotlin is a 5 and go is a 9.
C is also a 5.
Nah,
Go is the language for me.
How about your mother?
Nothing is improving?
Oh that is odd.
Toka's dad just had spinal surgery, I think he is fine now.
He does not even remember me visiting him in the hospital.
The drugs must have been strong.
Anyway, come back and work in my room :D
Okay.
<3
Did you find out why?
Did you get to the Temple?
Steamworld dig 2.
Get it.
What are you doing now.
Did you import all your phone photos?
I want to see them all.
I will wake you up at 04:20.
Just shove it up your vag.
COMING HOME
PREPARE THE SAMBOOOOOOOOOSA OR SOMETHING
YEAH
CLOSE THE PORN
CLEAR THE HISTORY
CLEAN THE POOP
:D
15 minutes
Yeah, have you seen the jumping face stomp to the old guy?
Hello Mariam.
Aparrently article 7 in the EU treaty says suspention of any member state who uses military against its own citizens.
They are not guarding civilians.
They are beating them.
But you have been taking it for a long time now, right?
My throat is weird and my nose is dry.
And maybe my eyes too.
How are you?
The pollution is really bad today.
The weather seems normal though.
My sister brought the illness.
The cold.
The forth day of it.
Are you alive.
Suuuuuuuuure.
What is what?
Do you know if it stops working after a while?
Have you researched what you take?
Why did you change?
Did you think the other one was working well?
No idea, but how was it modded?
I woke up.
A game.
BAAABY
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO.
Be back before I am back.
It is not free.
Check the pirate bay.
I will download it and take it next time I come.
13GiB.
Just play it at our house.
A linux version from steam.
Steam uses DRM to stop you sharing games.
It will log me out of my steam account.
Only one computer can be logged in at a time.
When I get home I can send you the details.
Oh that is not too late.
I am okay.
The cold is almost gone.
Are you fine?
Sushi is such an egyptian thing.
It is the like egyptian hipster food.
It is just a boring food that people fanasize over.
Tell aya to take you to the breakfast bar.
That is problematic.
Why not tell Aya to just come to your house instead.
What did you have?
Magdy got some special coffee for us.
I have no idea, it was from a coffee shop.
Ewwww guava.
You have a toaster?!
That does not seem like a toaster.
Because there are no good loafs of bread in egypt.
Jesus 280 char hell.
HELLO
It is almost home time.
I am programming in garo today :D
Did you go to parents?
Did breakfast consume you?
When will you be home?
I will leave in 8 minutes
Did you get just one?
I am home.
Yes to the mashy.
Hello
Ready?
Early footage of golem.
Yeah I am mostly fine ow.
Are you home?
Where did you go?
Will you bring bread?
I am a bit tired.
Or hungry.
I am now.
pualth
Toekabee
It should send me an email with a verification code.
What am I meant to do?
Switch to linux and use libreoffice.
Should do, yes.
Although microsoft try very hard to make them now.
not
I got a tiny little chip in my front tooth.
I think it is tiny.
pualth
MP2H7
I have other game sites too.
And I must own around 40 3ds games.
And before digital games, at least 150.
But I pirate most of my games.
I just blew the illness out of my nose.
It kept coming for five minutes.
It was insane.
I can breathe really well.
It probably sounded like an exorcism from outside the bathroom.
Morning.
Yeah.
There are three save files.
Click downloading at the bottom.
It will take you to the download screen.
Go to file, preferences, or something.
Then the downloads tab.
Set a download speed limit to 4mb/s
I used to I think.
But no.
Jesus.
I have 500GiB now and it is glorious.
I am okay.
A 7.
How are you?
No what pain.
Oh.
My sister got an implant in her arm that makes her not have children for five years and stops her periods.
Aparrently everyone got them in school when there were around 15.
I am not sure they have it here.
Yeah.
I reset the password and such so you did not accidentally log in and fuck it again.
I am good.
I like working only six and a half hours.
But what I like more is meeting mariam.
I have not used the vpn in forever.
It would not auto reconnect, and our connection dropped a lot.
The admin told me that was the reason.
If ptp goes the moment I fix btn, I will pop.
Price check?
At work with an out of sync gg password in my store.
Remind me tonight.
Yeah.
Not on Thursday.
Yes.
Where can you.
For me I like walking to a place.
Anything within 4km of me.
I do know a park nearish there.
It is quiet.
It is pretty close to awel abiss
When I get home.
Okay.
Okay.
HI
It is our aniversarry soon.
WHAT
When was our wedding?
Oh, august.
I am always off thursday.
Coming home now.
SAMBOSA?
Did it download?
Could not do what?
Just set it over night.
I mean start the download when you sleep.
Wait no, there are multiple collections.
If you start the download tonight when everyone is sleeping, no one will notice you are stealing all the internet speed.
Ah yeah, you have the fast but severly limited package.
We have the slow but you can download a lot package.
Tedata are also the only isp that sell true unlimited internet.
The "unlimited" package on vodafone and etisalat are more limited than our normal package.
Do you want to download a smaller game instead?
Do you watch idubbztv?
Where is your toaster?
I think your photos are not sending.
This is a grill.
Or a toastie machine.
But it does not have the shapes for sandwhiches, so just a grill.
Oh yeah.
Sorting by size:
SNES Collections, 3.94GiB is the biggest.
But the biggest is 2.94GiB and it is neutral leech.
Holy shit, an internal torrent for a game, in appimage format.
I have tried all these new software packaging formats, and AppImage is the only one I like.
It is a self executable file that mounts itself to a folder with all the dependencies it needs.
It is not a sandbox like flatpack, but flatpack is has zero usability, and is slow as shit to start.
Also, AppImages can update themselves and update using deltas.
The internal release did not archive it beyond the appimage.
Anyway, with so many stories of split isos in rar, seeing sanity is fresh.
The PS2 collection is at 2TB.
For a pi?
I thought it said, what we do here.
Between 3 and 13GiB.
We just finished.
Oh.
13GiB or 14GiB.
It looks like the complete collection.
When do you sleep?
What happened?
And they never did it?
I hope so too.
I woke up.
Good morning.
Are you not bad?
Baaaaaaaaaaaby
I think you may explode.
Oh god it better not be a stroke.
Make sure to read the booklet for the pills.
Just in case you get a side effect or allergy.
Hello.
I am good, only three more hours until the weekend.
And THEN TOMORROW
Still try?
You can not ditch me.
Because you are suggesting that trying is the best you can do tomorrow.
Which leaves the possibility that you do not come.
What did you do today?
Coming home soon.
Leaving in five minutes.
DID YOU GET BREAD ETC
I am home.
Hurry home.
I am playing a game called gone home.
So far it is nice.
When do we meet.
What the fuck is the point in a chrome book with a 512gb ssd and 16gb of ram?
I just played another game you should play too.
Wake up.
Good morning.
Can you leave your house so we can meet.
I expect this.
No I want to meet you all the time.
Which is why I want to meet you all the time.
She is fine, she is just getting ready to go out.
Where
7m to compile linux.
Oh no, I want to avoid all weddings.
You never took the money for the internet.
<3
I hope you are happy.
Will you send you instead?
I cleaned the bathroom.
Hi.
Pretty tired.
Just making some coffee.
I got used to my keyboard and it is the best thing ever.
I play tetris while I poo.
Currently in a 750 line game.
Oh wow, yeah it feels like forever ago.
On the way back from the airport, I made a reference to life is strange, and Nada asked if it was that game.
And now she wants to play it too.
1100 lines.
Jesus, sure it was not a friend online?
Yeah.
Green is street pass.
Orange is a friend.
Not sure if you get to choose your oponnent, but maybe.
I can not do anything until I finish my endless game though.
I keep pausing.
Being playing teh same lego game for 59 minutes.
1150 lines.
That is how many lines I have cleared in the game so far.
Without losing.
No... in one game.
An endless marathon.
At level 15.
18,000 - my income * 5 ish.
Yeah, but my income in the uk is currently zero.
And you had to have it in your account for 6 months, and the income for a period too.
Yeah, but my job trumps walkers right now.
My income at walkes was 12000 I think.
I mean, save away.
But in 2-3 years time, who knows what changes the UK has been through.
Not really seing that in the near future.
We have to wait until this shit show calms down first.
And it is already taking 3x longer than expected.
It is probably fine.
Do you always wear denim now?
But I would recomend a long focal length and low aperature.
Unless the background is fantastic.
I would stick it on aperature priority, and everything else is automatic.
I will sleep.
Did you save the photos on the computer?
If so, go to settings in the camera, and find the "format sd" option.
Yeah.
No, just go to ok.
Good luck today.
Yeah, they are fucked.
Did they EU take spain's side?
The referendum was not illegal or legal.
Moooooooorrrrrrrrrrning.
I am quite too.
I am the same.
Is is nice and quiet now though.
You can pay someone.
Hmmmmmmmmmm.
My job is pretty good, and toka is good.
The pollution, rubbish, noise, and broken things are bad.
The children are also very disrespectful.
hi
Hello
Hello
he
hello

I made my computer's led ring thing fade different colors when I get messages from people on riot.
So when I get a message from you, it fades in and out of cyan once a second.
Cyan, it always has been.
Toka and Nada went to a wedding.
Yeah, I am fine now.
It is Toka's turn now.
Come back.
Jesus, it was bad with me, but it is gone.
With toka it looks like it has not started or it just did not affect her much.
xom
Did you sleep?
In your own time.
I am falling.
I have had so much to eat today, but I still want more.
Get ready for it to break after a year.
Yeah I noticed that.
Before.
I have no idea.
I have to check when I am home.
Well if I can type, I am safe.
Want to find out how much deworming is?
Are you tempted to message me just to see the colour?
Did you find out?
Is it time to go get compost?
Are you going to the kitchen?
Yes.
To outside?
Hmmmmmmmmmm
Orange juice.
bakery stuff.
Ta3meya.
Top-up.
Fool.
Fateer
date things
yes
Lots of juice.
three
Yeah.
My day will never finish.
He lives near work.
I have 1x64, 3x32, 1x16, 1x4 ish.
We will walk.
So probably just after 6.
Arriving.
I am home.
Were you the teacher, or the student?
Hello.
Yellow person.
The computer ring light is not lighting up enough :(
Teaching what?
I have never had a teaching dream.
Are you fine?
You have friends?
Am I life like in them?
That looks fun.
Just overwrite.
Copy the old password just in case to a note.
Then pass generate old.com/old
Yeah, it is always an extra 30 it looks like.
Flat tires are my nightmares right now.
They are okayish right now.
Oh jeez.
It is just a guess.
Go get monnnnnnnnney.
<3
Good Morning.
Good morning.
I am okay.
Not too bad.
I started working on it and improving the map design screens :D
Can you complete marathon mode yet?
(Getting 150 lines)
Are you home yet.
Is this what you want?
Wake up.
That is crazy.
Why are you not at university today?
Oh your days off are very different to mine.
I wish I could show you the computer when you send a message.
It is the nicest cyan color I have ever seen.
What the hell.
Why does the word important have a red squiggly line underneath it?
Are you feeling any better?
Toka is out tonight.
But I can when she is home.
Oh hahaha
I think you only sent this so I do no start dreaming of you wearing denim.
Make a full application.
Okay this is all.
Three of them have one with lisa.
Two of them have toka and lisa.
Only one has only you, toka and lisa.
I have the photo folder on my computer, but toka is the one who adds and organises it.
I have no idea where to find new photos.
Said no one.
Are you going to apply to Magdsoft?
Unless you get really lucky, travelling an ungodly amount of time is normal here.
Just spend a month making an android application.
I know one of our team is leaving in two weeks.
None of the android developers are.
Well if you start without much experience he will only pay you between 1200 and 2000 a month.
Yeah, I would be giving you work to do.
I can help you become an expert until you feel confident :D
Not yet.
But you could.
Lots of interns come.
But I told him to stop hiring interns.
I am here.
Courses?
Android is front end.
There are designers but they are terrible at Android design.
Half of the android work is building the UI.
*Android program.
Nope.
I think it would allow us to be friends
Not allow, but help.
Fail what?
This will become your life.
As long as you want to, you should be fine.
I am here to help.
I can help you be confident you know how to do things.
Then I can help be telling him to hire you.
Then I can give you easy tasks.
Okay I will give you the hardest tasks.
But apply only when you are confident.
People are always coming and going from magdsoft.
And it is not going anywhere.
With learning android, I only recommend the official documentation, but it is a bit of a wall.
Being able to ask questions helps for the rest.
Any tutorials and books are usually out of date or confusing.
I just obliterated the marathon high score.
7m 51, 150 lines, 522000 score.
Started at level 15, got a lot of tetrises!
The previous high score was 300,000.
Did you not sleep all day?
Just got 522,000 points in marathon mode with endless off.
One of our cats has started sleeping under our blanket with us for the first hour then gets too hot and leaves.
The other cat is very confused and is constantly attacking it every time the blanket moves.
I keep hearing sirens tonight.
Did you have breakfast?
Food when you woke up.
Hmmm, I had two little pizza things and coffee.
But I have breakfast at work.
Babaghanoug, ta3meya and fool.
I eat most my food in the morning.
I also poop an average of four times before midday.
I think the coffee really causes everything to come out.
And waking up the same time everyday helps.
It sounds like the whole of cairo has turned into a tok tok driver.
Why are football fans so bad?
Do you want to see my keyboard layout?
Come back.
A computer.
What do you mean?
How much ram does your laptop have?
Hi.
Where are you.
That is a nice dinner.
Did you have already?
What is the sauce though.
Is it tomato mayonaise?
Oh I ate all the salad.
Sent?
Oh, biscuit factory.
Which line.
The easiest :D
5.
Did you meet a woman called patricia?
Or Trisha.
She is about 55.
I think she is working on line one.
He is quiet and tall right?
I fogot their names.
Yeah he is nice.
Yeah line one is the line they put the old peole.
Yeah, tip, never do more than you are meant to.
People will get pissed.
Unless they need help of course.
Stick the 3ds in the bathroom.
So you play a game every time you sit on the toilet.
Will you be home when I get home?
No idea.
You went to the fabric shop and came back?
How are you not awake yet.
What is cooking hot mama?
What do you want?
I want ta3meya, I miss it.
Maybe, but do we have eggplant?
Oh wow.
What kind of sick?
I just got home.
Why.
Just that or do you still feel weird?
I am.
What. Why.
Do you want a lost.host email address?
What. You better not die.
I am here all the time.
And I want you here all the time.
Without you I would be too lonely.
Are you just bored?
Did you get Android Studio?
I adjusted my bike gears, pumped the tires and cleaned it.
Now my hands hate life.
I slept for 10 hours.
How did you cut your hands?
Did you sleep?
The gears go perfectly up and make no noise.
But going down kind of messes up.
It is much better.
No thank us.
eloilduman
tamemoilman
No android person is here yet.
I think I will try Flutter at home.
On my new pc :D
Flutter is a cross platform mobile framework.
A7A
<3
Sohaaaaaaaaaaaa.
Lets make the transport app in flutter.
could you open a terminal on my pc
`cd ~/keyboard; git add .; git commit -m "switch layout keys"; git push origin master`
Last night I pumped up my tires, cleaned the bike, and adjusted the gear shifting, then oiled the gears.
Not yet, toka has not been cycling recently.
meutraa
then get the password from passmenu for gitlab.
You can paste in terminal with control+y I think.
Yeah.
Hmmm, I am not sure.
She never had the same symptoms.
Have you been up to much?
Fuck what up?
You can not fuck it up.
What are you talking about.
You can fail 100 times, it is my account.
All it is doing is sending the lastest keyboard files to gitlab.
So I can download them here.
No.
Just select the password, and middle click.
Standing outside and pointing at the wall will not acheive anything.
Where is the damp coming in?
<3
You might have selected an extra space, or line.
You can also right click, copy, and then press control + y.
Or control +v might work.
The middle left one.
Yeah, you just have to type `git push origin master` now.
Okay change of plan.
`git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:meutraa/qmk.git`
then git push origin master
Yeah.
That is not input.
It is the prompt.
Yeah.
Who looks at that kind of thing?
THANKS
Are you off to have your private dinner?
Kareem and baroody are off today so I am mega hungry.
Wake up.
No fool defrosted :(
:O
How do you wake up in time for university tomorrow?
Yes.
When did you have dinner today?
Oh this is quite a long time.
Exactly two?
I am just filling in the blanks in my investigation.
The case has been closed.
If we can I want to.
This information is disclosed now.
It is out of my hands.
Oh it is not terrible, but it must be annoyingly sore.
There is an official android studio plugin now.
I have the flutter sdk set up with android studio, just downloading an android image now.
So far, I like the flutter command line interface.
Things have been pleasant so far.
I got position 398 in the world on marathon.
I did all tetrises to 152, but with two holes, and 1 extra line. 
You play online?
Hi.
I woke up.
I think toka made me ill again.
Oh wow
The cats are making demonic breathing noises.
Two.
I would still go to work, but I would probably fall asleep.
I used to do it at university all the time.
Think we should give hero seige another go?
Why could I not play it last time?
Something to do with my controls.
Version 2.0 came out a month ago.
I just played a tetris marathon 150 line and did all tetrises bar one three liner.
Rank 312 globally on tetris axis.
I got the template application running :D
I quite like the flutter tool chain so far.
Everything is easy from the command line.
And hot reloading is very nice.
I am at work now.
Marrriammm.
Good morning.
No other people went to university?
Are they amazen?
I am good.
My weekend is almost here.
And tomorrow we meet.
BABY
ALMOST HOME TIME
I hated it because the controls were not working for me.
And there was no tutorial for the controls.
They rid did a lot in version 2 though.
redid
The screen shots show qwerty controls.
If you want to try on friday, I can send an appimage.
It is only 250MiB.
2500s
When do you go to university?
30 past.
I am home.
I have a newer version of party hard now.
I think the multiplayer is just locally though.
Yeah.
Did you see my hair?
No.
Nope.
I will end up playing it in about two years time.
Until then, I am blocked from it.
Did you play 64 or sunshine?
I think you played the galaxy games.
I only owned sunshine.
My sister bought it to me.
Well, I played it for a suprising amount of time, given its age.
I prefered super mario 3d world.
To me 64 looks awful. The galaxy games look a lot of fun.
Did you get to the last last level?
Champions road or so.
Could not get into 3dl because I played world first.
Actually, I only really find mario games fun two player.
When are you coming over for a 12 hour life is strange session?
I think not.
Also before you play life is strange, I have another game for you to play first.
I do not want you looking up descriptions of it if you have not heard of it.
I played it completely blind.
In about 3-4 hours.
Dress for a wedding and pretend you are going to it.
Sounds about right.
This is the first arabic music I like.
Are you not home.
Just went to check it and it is only torch light :/
I am awake.
Where are you.
I think I was too.
Actually, no.
Are you excited for today?
Of course.
But when will we meet?
At the same place as last time?
Yes.
I am rank 132 in the world at that game now.
I just got 152 lines all back to back tetrises.
I am home.
ben
Yeah, it was a good game.
Did everything in it bar the master trails.
Short though.
Should I leave?
At the gate outside the mosque?
Any updates?
I think it takes me 30 minutes to get there.
I am waiting for your signal.
I just started sneezing non stop.
I have no idea.
40 minutes is in ten minutes now.
Okay I am leaving.
You will be there first.
Come in.
All day long.
Pass by or come over?
Are you home.
For a bit?
Is it not gaming day tomorrow?
I think flutter does not have native maps yet :(
You have to write platform dependant code for it.
When she leaves the wedding?
So from 2:30 ish until midnight?
Oh.
That is not too short.
I am average height.
Probably.
Was I weird?
Okay, every thursday.
You were less denimy.
More forward.
More fluent.
And the best.
Did you sleep?
Are you at university?
I just woke up.
Do you ever get anxious when you see me?
Maybe I am a little nervous.
I think not, but maybe.
It is probably all the people.
Of course.
I would rather do nothing else.
Oh wow.
Are you sure you did not just forget?
Did you eat nothing?
Laxitives?
When I traveled up to the north coast with my family, I never pooped for two days.
Of course it has 'flatil' in there.
Are you bringing lunch?
What are the options?
Hummous if you can.
Most lebonese places do it.
My choice is always hummous.
I mean, I want a large amount of hummous.
I only know two places in City stars.
I never buy food outside.
Maybe but it is not as nice.
I do not know.
I can just cook some ta3meya for breakfast.
Pizza can be for dinner.
What will you do today?
Are you going to practice your disco moves?
I still have not had breakfast.
I am too lazy to make it.
Okay.
I am so hungry now.
Oh wow.
Mostly, yeah.
When did it really start?
What was for lunch?
Wake up.
It is.
Nada started playing it today.
I have only enough left for one cup.
And I am saving it.
I guess you will be home late.
Yeah she left.
I am fine.
A little bored.
We played Life is Strange.
Yeah I am bursting full.
Well the small ones lasted about a week.
Have you seen the super concentrate Robinson's "Squash'd"?
Keep a look out for it.
It is tiny.
It has been a while or so.
Hour or so.
Bring the noooooooooooodles <3
What the shit.
We chose IGN because they really understand our vision, share our passion for games, and believe in our mission to promote awesome digital content while helping charity.
Where are you.
You are right.
And woke up at 4am?
What kind of nonsense is that?
Jesus.
It is at that point you leave and visit again in two months.
He is living his own life now.
I am at work.
I had breakfast.
setxkbmap ara
But type setxkbmap us first
Otherwise you will be stuck in arabic.
Then you can press up to get back to the setxkbmap us.
Yes.
I think windows intel has a shortcut.
Control + alt + left
Something like that.
Wow.
That knowledge is from pranking in high school when I was 15.
There was also a shortcut to turn the computer of really quick.
And one to put it in high constrast mode.
The file manager.
If it does not work, it is complicated.
Yeah you only have permission in certain places.
Like /home/nada/
and /run/media/nada/device_name/
Something like that.
COMING HOME
I am home.
Okay I am home now.
Open a terminal.
Type `mount` and screen shot me.
type `df -h` screenshot
type `fdisk -l` screenshot.
Yeah look in the application launcher for a terminal.
Control + alt + t might work too.
Are you crazy?
Send a screenshot.
I can not read that.
You can also just send all the text.
That is the best way.
riot.lost.host
paul.lost.host
toka.lost.host
Did you finish the cake?
Okay, and what do you want to do?
From where?
Is the pen drive plugged in?
Send me the output of the commands `dmesg` and `sudo fdisk -l`
Just a screen shot for each.
Yeah.
Toka made a strawberry tart and it is nice.
Last time someone used that pen drive they did not "safely unmount and eject"
The number one important lesson no one learns.
First thing take the lesson of ALWAYS safely unmount and eject removable storage.
Otherwise you end up with corrupt states and data.
Like this.
sudo fdisk -l (el not 1)
And screen shot again.
No.
`sudo umount /dev/sdb1; sudo fsck.fat -a /dev/sdb1; mkdir ~/pen; sudo mount /dev/sdb1 ~/pen` 
Anything in that format, copy and paste to a terminal.
Looks like it worked.
Should be mounted in a folder called `pen` in your home directory.
a folder called `pen` in your home folder.
Open up the file manager.
Go to pen.
Copy the files from it to another folder in home.
Where ever you want.
Then `sudo umount /dev/sdb1` and wait for the command to finish before unplugging it.
I woke up.
Dungeons 3 might be good.
Good morning.
I am just leaving for work.
What is the metascore?
Still pretty low though.
BABY
Did you go for a run?
Did you make another cake?
What did you get?
I feel like salad.
But bananas will do.
I miss lettuce too.
Looks like magdy is replacing trello with an open source software focused alternative :D
He found it himself and prepared an introduction to me and eslam.
I like it.
So we went from bitbucket -> gitlab, slack -> mattermost, and trello -> taiga.
:D
:poop
:poop:
There we go.
What was different this time?
COMING ANY MINUTE
Hello.
I am home.
Coffee has to be hot or it tastes bad.
Where did you go.
I ate fattah.
Are you gone.
Are you coming home.
Good morning.
The free and open source one was too annoying.
Yeah.
When one comes along we can export data.
Up to you.
But I think so.
It is nice.
Yes.
You can rename them.
pass mv account.com/account new.com/new
Do you like what I did so far?
The series with announced dates are yellow.
And unannounced but planned are orange.
And the announced ones show the date.
The recipe can be a checklist.
And there can be an attached photo of the thing.
I know.
These are the things I will do each day.
Do not mix the houses needs with the pots needs.
Need pot
Extra what?
Did you think I locked you in?
It is stupid we have a door where that is possible.
It has failed as a lock.
Which files?
Oh, you can not yet.
Sharing is currently one way.
You can find the pen drive.
Or copy the film to share.
`/home/paul/share`
It will be on my computer in the same place.
Just copy the movie to the "share" folder.
That folder is shared.
Yeah.
mpv
That is the prompt.
`cd ~/share`
`pwd` tells you which directory you are currently in.
`~` means /home/paul
Did you watch it with Hana?
Hna
COMMING HOME
Are you alive?
I am fine.
We made some salad.
And too much onion.
Thanks.
It had pomegranate too.
I wish pomegranate seeds did not exists.
Then it would be perfect.
:D
Jesus.
Pretty sure this is sensationalist.
Many places crime goes unreported.
And I am pretty sure any occupied city is much more dangerous.
In the article it is only the worst in cultural practices.
Which means it is not ranked the world's most dangerous city.
Also, out of 20 "mega cities"
With a poll of 15 "experts" in each of the countries.
Which gives 355 responses.
So while the research is valuable, the article is not.
Cairo rated among the top 4 most dangerous cities by 355 experts around the world out of 19 cities rated.
Which puts it in the worst 20%.
But these are not 19 shit mega cities.
New york is included...
WHEN
Hmmm, should be now but I am not ready.
Okay packing up now.
Where are you.
It feels like you are never here.
What have you been doing?
Maybe I can take my computer this weekend so you can play.
What ports does your monitor have?
Does it have hdmi or DVI?
Or is it just VGA?
Take a photo of all the ports on it.
Yeah, I can not take my computer.
I do not have any cables or connectors that old.
That port is from 1987.
30 years.
No I am from 1991.
I have been drinking orange juice.
This is not 1991.
What is it?
It ties into my investigation.
Obstruction of the truth can have severe penalties here.
Good morning.
Wow.
I am tired.
Almost the weekend.
Because it is the morning.
I just woke up.
It is cooking now.
Did you find any nice cups?
You are just meant to take a photo, not buy it.
I started wearing the onsie again.
Same thing as me?
I am sleepy.
Try some tizanidine.
It is a muscle rexant.
relaxant
Nah I have to go to work in 20 minutes.
To buy?
The shock from the happy crying of the grandma to death.
No idea, what necessities?
Jeez, I thought you left here forever.
It consolidates with time.
Oh it is work time and super busy.
How are you?
Morrrrrrrrrrrring.
I thought it was brutal.
But also funny.
Probably fake.
When I showed toka she could not stop laughing which was disturbing.
He better be.
Finland.
I was very tired this morning.
But I am fine now.
A little excited for my second coffee, though.
How are you ?
:D
Taigo has some problems still.
It is a nightmare in general to setup.
Mattermost was just a few lines.
It depends on the university course.
I think there are many taught in English.
And I think around 90% of Finish people are fluent in English.
The only problem abroad is the living costs.
Rent should be around 7000egp a month.
Bills will take it to 10000 a month.
You have to watch, the university will have rules on employment.
In our one, you were not aloud to work more than 16 hours a week or something.
Which in the UK is 3000 egp a month.
Euro.
Yeah I am liking it much more than trello.
I have been busy since I last tried it.
I really liked it.
But not having maps was lame.
We could come up with a new idea.
The original was 8 minutes long and staged.
The top reddit comment was, "she is crying tears of joy that she can now kill herself"
or something like that.
vim is the shit
And the vim plugin for android studio makes it usable.
I like go and my keyboard and my computer.
I like the matrix protocol.
I like my keyboard layout.
I mostly like linux.
Nah.
That only means the library is not cross platform.
No machine code is cross architecture, but go can cross-compile very easily.
Go can build executables for android :D
They will have to build a cross platform maps library because they plan to use flutter in Fuschia.
Yeah, but I would not.
vim becomes muscle memory.
And then you use vi on every computer when typing something.
And other people do not have your edits.
So you will struggle to type.
end of line
I do not know beginning of line, but I know "insert at beginning"
ct, is very useful.
c (replace) t (to) , (first comma)
then type the replacement, esc
then you can press period to repeat the last command
Or ct$
dt) (delete to first ))
Did you manage to run it in the emulator?
The hot reload was great.
YUP
Packing up now.
It is my weekend.
What is wrong with this picture?
You usually have three days off though.
This week you have zero?
The season names.
Did you enjoy sun and moon?
I think the gameplay was better but the story was boring and the art style I did not like.
The environment felt empty and bland.
And why the shit does ultra sun and ultra moon exist.
Also Minecraft is already out on the 3ds
They should add 2019: shrek 8.
Barbiez 4: Ken Trouble
Big Rigz: No Limits
Oh wow.
Yeah we ordered one here.
I am awake.
I am okay I think.
Are you fine?
Our internet has been fine for ages.
Good morning.
Quick are you there.
BTN testing me.
Not sure I will get away with this.
This person is too thorough.
I have no idea, the guy is paranoid.
Ready to lose the account because they are assholes about VPNs.
Stop all your btn torrents.
This guy enabled the account but is going to cross check with ggn.
I changed the password.
He made me.
I think is best we get our own accounts.
After things cool down, I think the easiest way would be for me to invite you from ptp to ptp.
I have no idea which is the least suspicious method.
They piss me off.
Time to run our own tracker.
They do not know about that account.
They wanted to know the story of the ggn banning.
They wanted to know everything.
They wanted proof of ip ownership.
The fact tor is no allowed on these sites is crazy.
The annonimity of the users should be the most important.
Yeah.
But they can also search by ip.
In which case they know all the accounts anyway.
Yeah bringing up ggn was a mistake.
What about a gazelle tracker with a fully command line interface?
Instead of a website, only an api exists.
With a command line client.
site search HoI
Returns a json list
site get with a torrent id
returns the torrent
Honestly, I think public and unlogged is best.
But how do you ensure having all the torrents?
Torrents must be rated to filter out the spam.
Or require an account and ban the account when they upload shite.
But have public sign up.
If they want to create another acount and upload again and again, fine?
Have a points system to reward seeding
Give more points for seeding well rated torrents
Require points to upload torrents
the pirate bay is still going
But the selection is poor.
Kat used to be good
but it got raided or something.
Does demonoid exist?
Giant ad at the top telling me to use a VPN, xom
Come back.
Is it based on linux?
Did you see samsung allowing lany linux distro on the galaxy phones?
I have no idea. I assume they provide support for distros, because why are we stuck with android on phones?
I wish you never sent the word so I could check if I new it.
I feel like I have looked at it enough to remember.
Do you not get sore?
I get sore after 8 hours.
Esra2
Why did you not want to wake up?
What was your MVC value?
It is the Mean Corpuscle Volume.
Which is the average volume of a red blood cell.
Yeah it is low, but just.
The normal is 80-100.
You can increase it by taking b6 suppliments and iron supplements.
It could mean a lack of b6, iron, or a sensitivity to gluten.
Apparrently doctors usually ignore an abnormal mvc count.
MCH is Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin.
26-34 is normal for that.
So you are juuuuuuuuust low for it.
But again, low iron is the problem.
The high leukocyte count is too many white blood cells.
More than 11 means leukocytosis.
Which happens when you get ill.
Not really an issue I think.
I would take iron, b6, b12, and d12 or maybe d6 daily for a month or two and get another test.
Gluten is a thing in wheat.
Some people can not digest it so it builds up in the body and becomes harmful over time.
About 1 in 100 people.
Trying to do nothing.
I hope you are awake.
Did you meet Isrot?
Which is isrot to me.
Why is she making hummous?
What did you hate about the world?
Is it just your studies?
Are you becoming a hummous addict?
No need to worry about how useful you are.
Because the full thing is usefulnes to other people.
And pfft, care about yourself first.
Is a rule you made up?
Did you sleep at 9pm?
I did that too.
Nope.
I am not that fancy.
I have never met any one who has.
Actually I did, but they had a skin condition.
I never noticed you had giant hands.
Good night mariak?
Sure.
I did.
Hmm okay then.
But when I used the form to downgrade online, it told me it was not possible.
I did it to upgrade.
Before the first month finished.
Usually not needed.
Happens when you turn the computer off and windows is too shit to deal with it.
It will just fix the filesystem indices.
Which should be done ever time the computer starts, but wiiiiiiiiindows.
Leave it to finish now.
2047
Yeah.
No.
The unlimited might be.
Our plan was 140.
With 120GiB download or something.
Tal2a means fast?
Not sure it was that one either.
Tal2a gave you high speeds and low download limits.
The standard gave you low speeds and high download limits.
The unlimited gave you any speed, unlimited, and high prices.
Pass by the vet on the way back and ask?
It did not.
That is 10%
It increased because of inflation.
Logging in hold on.
Yeah looks like it.
Just confirm the data cap.
Are you not talking to an agent?
Also we downloaded 150gb this month.
To give you an idea of how much we download.
When you pay with my card, be quick.
It will ask for a visa password.
use alt + p, search visa, paste it somewhere, and count accurately.
It is timed.
Yeah.
You will understand when you get to the visa password screen.
2 Mibibytes a second
Why?
You said you can do it and you are on the page.
What did the vet say?
Yeah.
Probably.
But Ahmed will probably come back today.
What.
Order it all.
All the hash.
But butter butt beans.
Okay.
You made them already?
Omar came over already?
Why are they weird.
Did you start.
Are they strong.
COMING NOW
Toka made cake.
The special kind.
We have more.
:D
grub
Probably because you did not take on the people needing english help.
New phone number.
A bit worn out.
How are you?
Did you book an appointment for the cat?
Yeah been taking them every day.
Work is a bit boring.
It always needs a booking.
Unless you want to wait two hours and be told to go home.
Hahahahahaha
Everywhere?
Because we have water here.
Phone them up and ask why.
Having water outages is okay for them when nobody complains.
They will happily turn the water off while they take their time and fix something or change something.
When will you be back?
They shut at 5 do they not?
Have you booked?
You said you would be back at 7:30.
I would leave the house and meet you at the vet?
Yeah then call them up.
Unplug the external drives when that happens.
An empty sd card adapter plugged in would do that to my computer.
Did you phone them?
Okay.
You made a burger???????????????
Wait.
DId you say you would go today?
Because I want to relax for a night.
Coming home.
I kept telling him I know about it, and I already have.
At the top somewhere.
`gedit ~/.bash_profile`
Try cutting your flatmates.
There are so many things that are very beta currently.
But I do not even know if that works.
I changed her password to `lisalisa`
applicant without a capital of course.
Did you dentist already?
Can we do the vet tomorrow?
What no it was lettuce.
Morninnng.
I am tired.
But I have the evening to rest.
How are you?
Did you do anything today?
Hopefully not.
Toka made some bean burgers.
They tasted healthy.
That is disgusting.
What have you been doing?
Pretending to swim through the heart?
Yeah all the walls do.
Why are they in there?
I have heavy stuff in there that could easily break them.
My head hurts :/
Good morning.
What happened?
Any advice on getting them to take the pills?
A lot of it is, yes.
Jesus a gun.
The military guy did it with a finger.
Yeah.
Cake.
And hummous.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Cake and something light.
No rice or pasta.
My head is dying.
I really need one.
Is it a monster?
COMING FIVE MINUTES
Hi.
Where are you?
What no please.
I can not imagine you crying.
It would make me too upset.
I hope I am not everything though.
Our small times together are not enough.
I had more cake.
5 hours ago, but I am just starting to feel it.
It takes an hour or two, but this time is different.
She went out, but she is fine.
I really want full but there is only one pita bread.
There are four burger buns.
Help.
I could not keep a straight face through this.
I can not stop laughing at this.
You must be missing soooomething.
Try turning the speakers on and off.
You can plug it in.
`sudo mount -a` after though.
A bit.
Yeah I am eating fine.
alsamixer
Check to see if it is muted or low volume.
m for mute
up and down to change volume.
Did you try restarting?
The cats are being dewormed.
Yeah it is fine.
But getting them to swallow a pill is impossible.
This is what we tried.b
But it seems an expert in spitting it up.
What are you doing today.
No.
Did you give the medicine to the cats.
Yeah, but did you?
It was meant to be last night.
Interesting.
We just took the pills from the vet.
Morornning.
I will look it up on the internet.
Shhhhhhhhhh.
I have been feeling tired recently.
I need coffee when I come home or nothing gets done.
My mum says these days they have deworming stuff like the defleaing neck stuff.
Worth searching the internet about.
She also made the pill swallowing method seem trivial.
Se was like, just do this (the same as we know).
I was not sure I understood it.
The data is stored in perpetual pings.
So limited by your bandwidth?
Probably because imcp has no congestion logic.
Complete guess.
Oh wow.
Are you going to come visit?
Coming home now.
Wooooooooow.
Wait what?
Regular halogen bulb, which century are we in?
Hello.
I am sneezing too much today.
I must be ill.
I am still sneezing.
Or an antihistamine.
<3
They are tiny.
DId you get me bread?
Two breads?
Two breads and fool?
Hummous?
Oh.
As long as you do not eat them all first.
Are you going to come play life is strange this weekend?
You know where to get them forever?
When are you going to teach amina?
12-3?
Baaaaaaaaby.
GO TO THE GYM
Where is this?
GO FOR A WALK AWAY FROM PEOPLE
Where did you go.
Hmmm I think I have not been there.
Why were you there?
COMING
It is my weekend.
Mona is very close to moma.
Did you see the walking dead season 8?
Yeah, but we have two cats, and six pills.
The section on Logistic request pasting.
I just had a 13egp avacado.
Pretty good but I am thinking about noodles.
Tomorrow?
Oh, I never saw the previous message.
I am not at work.
And my plans today just got cancelled.
I have done that with a film.
But I did not remember watching it at all.
Felt like a giant waste of bandwidth.
How dare you talk to me before my morning Joe.
To help someone with something.
I have a new game to play now.
I think I will save this game.
Are you doing anything today?
Good morning Mariaaaaaaaaaaaaaam.
Wakey wakey.
A cold or a flu?
I caught a hunger.
I have been playing a game of hoi for about a month.
I am starting to think it is impossible to finish a game.
I currently own or ally with the entire world bar the americas.
Oh and australia + islands.
The flu is pretty uncommon. And more serious.
The cold happens all the time to everyone.
Yeah, they completely changed air stategy too.
It is much much better now.
Naval is still a bit boring.
I took the uk today by wiping out their entire air force, blanket nuclear bombing every region at the same time, and dropping paratroopers next to london, capturing london, building a port, shipping tanks in to clean up.
Yeah it is.
Once you really get used to the order system, taking a country takes no time.
As a 12x4 gaming layout, what do you think?
tilde is usally important for cheating.
b is important for in game chat, but I can switch layouts to chat.
I suppose periods are also important for chat.
I am not sure how usefull having real arrows keys is to a game.
All the paradox interactive games have consoles.
Hmm, what about instead of 7, 8, 9, and 0, some F keys for same scumming.
Pretty sure numbers after 5 are not used in games.
0 could be the tilde key.
They have to be far apart though.
Mariam.
Do you want to voice chat?
When will you be home.
Did you draw the dog nada plays with?
I have hot chocolate and ta3meya, in my onesie.
Are you still home?
Good everything.
Waiting until switches are 20gbp on ebay.
Are you going to paint Hla's face?
Mariam.
Catalonia actually did it.
Watching season 2 now.
I do not know much about her.
Just that she likes trance music, and has skin picking disorder.
Can you imagine how pissed half of scotland would be if our government declared independance and then the UK marched in, took down the scottish government and started ruling themselves.
**all of scotland
I saw a poll for the regions supporting independence, and no region is in favour anymore.
The countries of the UK, but with England in London, North, and rest I think.
Sure.
Do you have thoughts about her?
Drinking too much orange juice.
Baaaby.
Have a good home day <3
Yeah it was infested with flies and made me spill the coffee in the morning.
My coffee was exploding.
I have to see that with sound.
PICK UP FOOL
I am coming home.
PICK UP HUMMOUS
How many hours?
Spoiler: there are moons.
Where are you these days.
fuck
I am so far away from a switch.
I need shoes first.
Jesus, it is still a bit hot here.
We had hailstones twice last year.
It gets cold with no double glazing and insulation.
The last one I had exploded on me.
Baaaaaaaby.
BROCOLLI
Do we have carrots?
Are we having roast vegetables.
WHAT ARE WE HAVING
Oh yes.
Phew.
Are you alive.
Jesus.
Good morning.
Not too bad.
A little worn.
I am not sure.
I just need a week to play games or something.
How are you?
Some of it.
It is often filled with stuff though.
I leave for work at 10:15 and get home at 5:30 these days.
I have plenty of time.
I rarely code at all at home though.
I try and just burn out.
Are you a kotlin guru yet?
Kotlin is much more enjoyable.
Just replace the list with Go :D
To write software for you self.
That does not need 50% debugging time.
Go is about making things simple.
And encouraging the one true way.
As an example, it does not let people have different code styles.
It just auto formats.
When you start with go, you find that you solve problems really quickly.
The standard library is designed to be as orthoganol as possible.
So there is not two ways of doing the same thing.
It is very strict, has modern syntax, and unicode strings by default.
It has very few primitive types and they are all obvious.
uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int8..., float32, float64, bool, string, complex.
No weird words like long, long long, long double, int, byte, char.
Where you do not know how wide each type is.
The width of int in C is system dependant.
Most computers it is 32bit these days, but it can change.
It has built in map and (what is the same as a list) slices.
Baaaaaaaaby.
Is it roast vegetable night.
Yeah I like that.
But what happens when we run out of space.
Okay.
I will be home soon.
SO HUNGRY <3
I am here.
What happened.
I did to create a tiny webservice.
But I told no one :D
What are you talking about?
No, this makes me too sad.
Why could you not talk to anyone?
Oh.
Too much orange crack.
To me you seem fine, then you say things like this.
And it makes me think you do not tell me things.
Pipe doon.
Maybe I need to say the opposite things.
Why did you not communicate?
Why was it just you?
Well thank the fucking lordy lord.
OpenVPN was the most piss annoying thing to set up and mantain.
I think it is always better to let it out to someone.
It just feels better after.
Of course.
Hmmm, well they finished the medication.
Hoping for the prolapses to stop now.
When your anus turns inside out.
Well, the diarehea causes it to push too hard.
Where were you?
It is bed time.
I am so tired.
I need way more sleep.
I am here now.
Could you look up the requirements for a UK spouse visa?
@paul:lost.host
Case sensitive
Usually happens only when your own country revokes your citizenship.
Because of something?
Why do you tell him anything aslan?
go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
Oh wow.
He does not have a choice.
If you go to an airport, there is no parental approval.
At no step in applying abroad do you need a parent's approval.
Oh I did.
Did you make a calendar.
But he kept telling me and showing me screen shots, and how to install the plugin.
Oat spread...?
Yeah I would not trust him.
He looks supportive now.
But I think anything you say will end up being used against you.
Also, if we are still here, you could come back, just slyly.
The only thing stopping you coming back is your parents getting help to restrain you in Egypt.
Which they might be able to do.
But, yeah, why on earth would you want to go back.
That is pretty dumb.
You would just wait till he sleeps and then leave.
Pretty irrational planning there.
How does it matter where you do not pray?
Like there is a chance you will suddenly start praying here.
Pray to release you.
Esraa never said anything.
It has a garbage collector with microsecond pause the world times.
It produces static binaries that have no dependencies and can be deployed anywhere by copying the file.
It can be cross compiled for many platforms just by setting two environment variables.
The `go` tool itself is the most simple tool chain.
Installing a go program is as simple as typing `go get site.com/user/repo`
Ah I need the more advanced details about the financial requirements.
The actual formula.
No I want more time awake but also sleep more.
COMING IN FIVE MINUTES
Strict alarms.
Always wake up at the same time.
It becomes habbit.
But I would set it to 8 hours sleep.
If you have to wake up at 6, go to bed at 10 and just stay there.
Yeah she was not there long, but her husband was nice and worked with me.
She was green.
Have you talked to Nada today?
Been a long time since an update to this.
A bad day for her.
Dad fight.
No, I think not.
A panel...?
Our social worker?
Carol.
Carol mcarthy.
Oh yeah.
I was close.
She will be so proud.
He told you not to bother...?
That makes no sense.
You will get no jobs by applying for no jobs.
The co-op is just around the corner.
And if you are wrong about your prediction, you get a job.
It is their job to see your application.
He is always very pessimistic.
Every time someone has an interview at our company, I have to interview them.
I have no idea what I am doing.
But we get a HR next week aparrently.
Just ban the word "like" from your vocab.
Practice.
Jesus.
What............
What is it now?
Did you have your laptop or phone between that time?
I usually play the 3ds or a game until I fall asleep.
I used to also watch live streams until I slept.
They were almost always Spelunky the game.
This is what I really watch when I want to sleep.
This is the ultimate sleep jam.
Not sure that counts as a joke.
It just seemed like an answer.
When do you have to wake up tomorrow?
I choose Midday.
I have hot chocolate.
I woke up.
Find the model number.
Wake up.
Tell them to look on the bottom for the model number then.
I mean it looks fine.
I think it is worth the risk.
I could not find it online.
But 125 is low.
Where is it?
Why does she not want it?
"nobody is above using a rice cooker, cooking rice manually is for idiots."
Wow does her rice cooker suck?
Let me ask ben about rice cookers.
Anything I should know before buying a cheap rice cooker?
Yeah but I am pretty sure a rice cooker beats people unlike dish washers.
You have forgot about the rice occasionally and had burnt rice at the bottom.
Or did not add enough water.
I mean everyone fucks up.
But rice cookers do not.
Also rice cookers are less effort.
And easier to clean.
And keep the rice hot until ready.
She knows how much it cost.
Going to get one for 6gbp.
Second hand.
Some housewife thinks she is above using a rice cooker.
She is a housewife.
Yeah, this is what I thought.
You are a housepartner.
Okay but where is it?
Friday, but which station?
After 12.
Sure.
The best one.
HI
Are you fine.
I am hoping 5 oclock comes and I can go home.
SOON
COMING
University was the end of me too.
xom
Oh be calm
What are you angry about?
The professors or the students?
In the classes or outside?
I can empathise somewhat people positions like that.
When lots of people depend on you, and you try, it is very easy to not be good enough at your job.
And everyone loses.
And it makes you sad.
I am talking the other way around.
It is not the students humiliating the teacher.
When you are a great teacher students like you and things are smooth.
But as a bad teacher, everything is bad towards you too, and it stresses them out and makes them horrible.
And Ain Shams University having bad teachers is why it does not rank at all in rankings.
I would just focus on learning and trying to become independant.
Say okay to the teacher and avoid them.
When they complain about something, say sorry and leave.
Lectures are very quick in general, study outside should be about 2-3x as much as lecture time.
Lectures are even optional in a lot of universities.
Can you sit at the back and just study yourself if they are being useless?
OO is cancer.
Are the classes that small?
He just sounds shit.
All the CS graduates at our company, if I had to guess, I would say they have not studied anything after high school.
They seem to have no understanding of computer science.
I would not rely on the university.
The good thing about it is no one can really make you work during the time.
You can use it as an excuse to study yourself.
And pretend like you are studying for university.
The cost of Ain Shams is not expensive though.
I remember I cried when my mum paid 2GBP for a peice of plastic from a traveller.
It was just a blob of plastic.
It was so useless.
Also a good time to meet new people.
As long as your family are not struggling because of the costs.
That is your parents bad decisions, not yours.
It is their money.
Eventually as you become independant of your parents, you stop caring about all the mistakes they make, because they are stubborn and never learn.
I mean eventually they drive you crazy too.
You end up being much more at peace when you let them do what they want and just ignore them.
In general with everyone.
Them spending their money on you is only negative to them, so you can ignore it. If it was negative for you too, it is an issue for you.
There was a game about being chefs in a restaurant. Top down, and local co-op focused.
Do you have any idea?
Damn, no linux.
Where did you go.
I do not want to act imposing.
I just do not want you being sad.
Where are you walking to?
I used to walk at night in Scotland.
It was the only time I would because it was empty and quiet.
And dark.
I want to.
Look what I made.
Come send a message so I can show you the light.
Pretty accurate statement.
The cyan in the video is blue.
In real life it is really cyan.
Wake up.
Me too.
Mariammmmmmmmmmmm.
When are you on the laptop.
Hi.
A whole day without you is hard.
I woke up at 9 thinking it was too early to want to wake up.
Will you send you.
It is never ending exams in your life.
Okay, second only to sending yourself, your past self.
Oh you look mad at me!
Here is my past self.
I do not know what to do.
What do you mean by the remaining string? The part that detached?
ma
So there is a loop hanging from the ceiling that had a peice of plastic, inside of which was a knot tying the single wire to the loop?
I mean to do now, to pass time.
Yeah no, I will pass on the glod star.
Tetris and work.
While I think I can visualise the setup, the answer throws me off.
It is a picture kind of problem I think.
Oh wait, because you could not reach the loop, your threw the pencil through the loop?
Seems like a giant waste of space, and heating.
Where did you go.
Good morning.
Are you off today?
Are you fine?
I need my coffee, but then I will be.
We are going to buy a rice cooker and trousers today.
It makes rice perfectly everytime.
It is a tub.
An electric thing.
Buying a cheap rice cooker today.
Ben has been using one for five years now.
And says, "making rice manually is for idiots".
A rice cooker just eliminates human error.
I have no idea.
It cost 6gbp second hand.
A person thinks they are for "working people or people who can not make rice".
Too proud to let a machine beat them.
She said she only used it twice.
I should, yeah, I will look for one.
Electronics are a bit more expensive here I think.
Make an account here and get good so we can play together.
BABY
jstris.jezevec10.com
Become a master, prepare to battle me, lisa, and toka.
Are you here.
Buy them all, I dare you.
But you have an exam today.
I have no idea who he is.
Hello.
Did you do the exam?
Oh :(
I am fine, pretty hectic at work, but it is almost over.
With what money...?
Okay.
Are you done yet?
Got some basmatti for the rice cooker.
This better be good.
16GiB of ram is where it is at, never even thinking about running low is calming.
Was it fine?
I am exhausted today.
Stressful work.
Are you going to make hummous tonight?
Are you online?
Ready to join the tetris game?
At a laptop and ready to tetris?
Nada, toka and I are playing.
Have an account on the site and join that room.
Oh two player, hold on.
What is?
I just got my 40 line record: 69s.
Did you join the room toka sent?
Adjust the controls.
WHY
I told you to practice.
The 3ds version is slower.
My record of 40L on the 3ds is 85s, and 69s on this version.
Looks like you are not a true tetris fan.
I bet lisa will like it.
No I have not had any from yesterday.
Yeah we tried it today.
Made way too much rice, but it was perfect.
Why do you not get one?
It looks very similar to the slow cooker.
I will get into bed.
It is too cold and I am so tired.
I miss you.
whom'st've'nt
Also why are you using backticks instead of apostrophes?
I think owsey is one of my favourites now.
Are you home now.
I have hot chocolate.
Nothing I hope.
Are you on the laptop?
Do mp3s still not work on the ios riot?
Do you still have ios?
Oh maybe I forgot to turn it up.
Yeah I did forget.
I am just a feed of the Ambient channel to you
Good morning.
I will make fool and listen to your message.
Did you see the cyan light?
It is so cold.
Which movie did you watch?
I hear the new mario game is the best thing to ever be made.
Mignight in paris seems like a different title for Before Sunrise.
Okay coffee time.
Nope.
On my chair.
Did you call first?
Yeah, but I am really happy with my iris 640.
What the living fuck?
I will watch it after dinner.
Are the drivers as good though?
Also not out yet.
Yeah their new gpus have great drivers I think.
Hello.
I have not seen the thick of it yet.
Come in.
I will make hot chocolate.
Just started Motosport Manager Endurance or something.
Seems pretty deep.
I want food in me.
Is it just this week you have exams?
WAKE UP
Goooooooooooooooooooood morning.
fool, ta3meya, I DO NOT KNOW EVERYTHING
Coffee.
It must be ginger.
Oh wow.
What happened at the vet?
Is it stronger?
Did the xray look different?
WHY
Esraa never spoke to me.
She took one look at my pirate costume and skedaddled.
Esraa is not your alter ego.
I miss you too.
Obviously.
Egypt.
There are places, but they usually have high visa costs.
And a few places we can both go without cost.
Depends on the country.
I know the answer.
Sometimes as much as the flights.
Nope.
Nah, toka did not seem so enthusatic about it.
Looking out for a bread maker.
Maybe it is a story about "Super Mario's Brothers"
And mario is not either.
When I last tried I was shit.
Okay I have prepared the computer.
Time to install it.
32 bit arch support is gone.
I still can not belive how many games are 32bit only.
Why the living fuck is that the case?
Yeah, so why are games still shipping with 32 bit binaries?
Games on linux should not come with .dlls either.
Mariamamiamriamariam
This is your real name.
Moraadadaadraadoraad
.so files, sure, but not .dlls.
But also, provide the fucking source for that .so file because how the shit do we know it is safe?
That made me think. I just checked a load of game directories and none of them have licenses for the libraries they use.
And there is no way they all use closed source libraries.
I have coffee.
That is me.
Nope.
But we do have some left.
Where did yo go.
Turn notifications for our room on and off again, reinstall the app, enable all the notifications.
Good morning.
Are you on android or ios?
The real solution is to have the chat open at all times.
Or make your phone glow cyan.
Wake up to a message saying the servers are down, check, entire SBG ovh location is down, including their CDN which was hosted there.
What no, finding a bread maker will take time.
It was a video about christmas...
What the fuck.
Why are you watching adverts?
My monthly wage is 4500.
half a month's labour
But 120gbp.
How much are they there?
Actually, that bread maker is 290 dollars.
But not very popular.
Two seperate lines got damaged and 3 datacenters went unpowered.
Somewhere a 99.9% uptime is going to become a 99.8%.
Today we will make cake.
Did you make this?
Is your exam over yet.
Oh yeah, okay.
Good morning.
I hope you are better now.
After prayers.
Okay so when are we meeting.
I made an image of my keyboard layout.
It is parent day.
So it would be in the evening.
Here is my keyboard layout.
The evening or typing?
I guess five at the earliest.
Find out if you can first, and when.
I will try to check riot at her parents.
The two exlamation marks are enough to stop reading.
Inca few?
In a
Will you be there til late?
When do you plan on leaving. Why are you there alone?
Have you seen r/iamverysmart?
I enjoy reading those.
Come in.
You will have to leave when she has to?
Can you give an estimate of the leaving time?
I can be there around five.
Do you have a meeting point?
Bus with toka but she will something herself.
Do
I can not write on a phone.
Where will we meet?
At five?
01000742225
This is toka's phone number.
Because I am not walking the time is not accurate.
At five if I am not there, phone.
Leaving now.
Are yo ustill waiting?
We got on the same bus as mostafa.
That is pretty good.
It was very nice to see you.
I always feel like I am acting weird around you.
Maybe because we only meet a tiny bit I feel like a lot of impression is sqeezed into a small time so I worry more.
But I am surely just being stupid.
Just checking, because toka, nada, and their parents did not know the answer.
If you buy an egg from the supermarket, is there any chance it can hatch if you leave it long enough?
What was better about this time?
Okay I am glad.
Now every week, okay.
Is lisa there?
I want to know her answer.
The eggs you buy are unfertilized, a male has not been anywhere near that hen.
An egg must be fertilized before it can start growing.
The egg you buy is like an external womb with all the nutrients, and an egg inside, it still needs the sperm.
They will never hatch if not fertilized.
Toka, nada, and her parents all got it wrong too.
I am finding out currently that no one else does.
I think lisa will know the answer though.
Ask her when she gets home.
I just told you in the other chat.
Just young.
But grown up.
You always say jesus when you see young people grow up.
What did you silently say to me?
Where are all your nerves going.
haha no.
I like being overly mean as comedy though.
You know how I really feel, I hope.
WHY ARE YOU JUST MAKING EXCUSES
Okay come back, the dishes are washed enough.
Did you drown in dishes?
Jesus that took forever.
Oh wow.
Do you ever think about him any more.
Did he not ignore you?
Oh no. I remember he was making you feel bad.
How can you love that.
It has to be all the time or never I think.
I think when you find people who are always, you get rid of the sometimes people.
You should listen to the music from life is strange too.
I need to download before the storm but it is huge.
For episode 1.
It is 5GiB a chapter currently.
I only know from the main game, but I would go for no.
Stop everything until you have played the main game.
Stand back awake.
We are going to watch some black mirror.
This in arabic sounds like a severe speech problem.
I am really really glad we talk.
And I am really really happy we meet.
What was your dream about?
Why is it so cold.
Are you awake.
What how.
Hi.
Oh hello.
You remembered your password this time?
Is the app different?
DOES IT HAVE VOICE PLAYING?
WHAT ARE WE EATING
But maybe if I send a recording, you can play it.
I think we do not.
Probably something else.
We are lazy.
Roast vegetables maybe.
COMING IN A FEW MINUTES
HOME TIME
How is your sleeping now?
That is funny.
The original author being the wanker, right?
Where are you.
Hi.
I woke up.
Are you awake now.
What will you do today?
I will get dressed and leave for work.
Send me what.
I think you need a PIXEL 2.
Can it take photos in the dark?
YOP
Is that a suitcase?
Where are you going.
How long is the walk.
You can not walk back to the summer.
Did you measure it?
Are you worried you are super fat?
Do you think you are fat?
I think I am fat.
Nah it is okay.
I will be fine.
But a little bit.
Yeah but it is not flavoured.
Hmm if you can make it like the rice your mum gave us.
Well you have not seen my belly.
Or my sides.
I will leave now.
Hi Mariam.
I have good arms and legs, and shoulders, but my belly, sides, and boobs are too much.
I am home.
I am so so sweaty when I get home.
Come back.
BRING ORANGE JUICE
What did yew have?
Did you ever see the cyan?
You can see a history of send files in riot.
It was on toka's phone. Maybe I can find the link.
Does that work?
Okay now it is freezing.
I mean I feel freezing.
You should see it in real life.
It is so much more cyan.
In the video it just looks bluey.
Why?
Do you like teal too?
I feel odd after meeting you.
I feel like I never spent enough time observing so I might forget.
Like maybe I wasted time.
But then I am also more convinced that the times are not as rare any more.
Where we were and how you looked and what we did.
You can zoom over with the car you will steal.
You never replied when I said we got on the same bus as Mostafa.
I was at the front, gave a glance over the bus people, walked to the back after paying, gave him a second glance, *the glance intensified*, then I nudged toka and said, "Look who it is."
So now he must think we are spies hired by your parents.
"I was sitting at the back of the bus bored out of my mind, then the bus stopped and some people got on, "SHIT", said my mind as the sweat started pouring out of every folicle on my head."
I think toka said nothing.
Nada in my head is still so young.
I feel like I have not seen her since we started talking.
Or that image is just stuck in my head.
AND BREAD
I have some orange, apple, and banana.
The three most stereotypical fruits.
No you can not sleep yet.
You can almost sleep.
Did you sleep.
And everything.
When are you coming.
Wake up.
I am too late.
And noodles.
Where are you.
It is kind of sad that you are not here most of the time I am awake.
What happened with the guy making the space game by himself and burning out?
Then a year later he made a long blog post.
It has been about a year since then.
And where is cube world?
They started release tonnes of new content screenshots and videos. But has there been an update?
Are you still not awake.
I am off to work.
I will be back in twenty minutes.
Hello.
Cube world is still dead after all the updates?
July the 2nd was the last update.
What is your plan to fix your sleeping?
Set a bed time and stick to it.
Make it 12 or 1.
And set an alarm for 8.
And always obey it.
Where did you go.
I am trying to get the internet before everyone come in and it is unusable.
Too many people downloading too much stuff.
Did you listen to this?
How are you going to get to abysaya in 45 minutes?
Baaaaby.
It is steal all the internet before everyone gets here time.
Baroody is here but my stomach is not feeling good.
I think you should.
Yeah.
I still think it will release.
I think everyone has forgot about it.
And it will release on steam to a mostly new market.
Dungeon keeper had an 11 year development period I think.
Dodgy memory.
Eating at home in the morning is bad.
Maybe it is before cycling.
I do not know.
Food does not go with coffee maybe.
corelated
Maybe.
Hahahahahahahaha.
No way on earth could they control that.
The tickets are not unique.
That is a problem.
They should just charge the average.
Some people pay 2 pounds for 1 station.
Some pay 2 pounds for 12 stations.
2 pounds should be the cost of the average, probably 3-4 stations.
The people paying for short trips compensate the ones going long.
And nobody complains.
Everyone will hate the new system.
Nobody ever complaint that 12 stations costs the same as 1.
If you are going 12 stations, the metro cart is empty most of the way.
So to discourage filling empty carts is bad.
Charging more for busy carts makes sense.
But then it is not worth the time and complexity.
They already added adverts everywhere.
Have they sold the metro or something?
You do not expect the government to operate like a money hungry business.
Nobody trusts businesses.
Mostly fine.
Are you still in work?
Guess which project I am working on.
Close, Cargo.
Fixing the socket :(
Server side.
I WANT MISA2a2567 WITH PERFECT RICE
AND ADD A STOCK CUBE TO THE RICE
YES
Just editing.
Actually, I have not started.
Fixing some ill defined issues with the android version first.
How was the class.
Well, I just managed to log into the driver and the socket crashes immediatly.
And the dashboard has no way of assigning cars to drivers, so I had to do that manually.
The dashboard also could not even create drivers.
The dashboard is still called Sindbad.
Let me google it.
***Qabi
Yeah I was forced to publish it.
I told him to delete the cargo ones :/
You can send him release apks...
You can use crashlytics beta deployment.
You can use google play beta program.
These people piss me off.
Then again, maybe it would be just as bad if they knew too much about android.
I am hoping to get another pc soon and use linux again.
Mac OS annoys me so much.
Yeah :(
No I never had time, and when I tried for a day or two I did not like it.
There are no spare normal computers.
I think we do not need a sofa bed.
Unless my sister wants to create a room in the spare room for regular trips :D
They will never be happy in any hotel.
Is it over now?
Oh no.
That will be horrible.
You will be working 48 hour weeks.
On the phone.
Telephone support has to be one of the worst jobs.
The money is okay, and the experience is only good for telephone support and sales.
You could find so many more interesting jobs.
Telephone support is like a last resort; they hire anyone who can speak.
It will look bad on a cv if you can only keep a job for a month.
I support you having a small job, but less than 16 hours a week.
And in an area you actually enjoy.
Yeah but they will not stay at our house.
They just never would.
Did you hear my voice note last night.
Did it work in the app?
I have my coffee. What do you have?
Have you tried to make your own mocha yet?
Did you hear.
Oh I do not use riot so I did not see it.
I SAW IT
AND I REPLIED
Sorry for shouting.
Oh wow, it was 10 minutes.
Oh no it failed.
It is uploading.
There is it.
<3
Okay just do not sleep.
Come back.
Hello.
You have a voice message first.
I whistle too much.
I have actually never heard it recorded. I should listen to it.
I will have to make an hour long message tomorrow night.
I still want a video of you.
Yeah I keep listening to it.
Good morning.
This song sounds like a copy.
It kind of reminds me of a part of this.
I am at work.
Could you try to pinpoint the location of "the better pizza maker" on google maps?
Hmmmmmmmm.
I am recommending.
Okay I will try to find it.
I am so hungry.
We have not had breakfast yet.
There is.
Busy.
To cut the gum open?
Yeah tooth removal is pretty cheap.
But it is brutal.
They crush the inside of it then pull it out.
I actually had a tooth removed without anastetic once.
It will also bleed for a day.
You have seen the videos of people in the USA having wisdom teeth out.
I think only in the USA you get drugs that strong.
Sure.
Where?
Did you get a quote?
That is not a quote.
Have you looked up the dentist?
There are some real shit dentists out there.
Nope.
Was it this place?
Extractions are 235EGP.
Treatment Received: Wisdom Tooth Extraction, Fillings" Wisdom Tooth Extraction , teeth stuffingI have done treatment in this clinic for more than 10 years. Treatment is of excellent quality. I have great confidence in the clinic. I am totally satisfied and would recommend it for everyone. "Total Amount Paid EGP200
2013 though.
Book tomorrow then.
Sure.
Phone them.
Nobody phones to make a request for an appointment.
They phone to making a booking.
Yeah phone them.
Request systems are shitty.
It takes a couple of minutes to arrange a time you can both meet.
But you probably have to phone after 9:30 today.
It takes a couple of hours for someone to even notice a request.
Mariam.
Toka came home with her friends last night for a suprise party.
Everyone drank.
I walked in on toka having sex with her friend in my room.
I talked to everyone.
And eventually my mum and sister.
I spoke to toka in the morning, then made my mum and sister mediate.
That way it is their fault if the cost is over the max they said.
Where are you.
Jeez.
I hope people paint horns on sisi.
Yeah.
No, but we should get pizza.
Are you fine though?
Mostly yeah.
I am soooooooooo hungry.
I think fateer?
Yeah.
Yeah.
COMING
HOME TIME
When you stayed at ours, did you ever use the shower?
Was it not too shit?
I am home.
Oh they look good.
A little creepy.
I think because the toning and the action.
Like they are between realistic and not.
It is shit.
I am suprised I do not remember you complaining.
Login for what?
An android phone?
Can you not reset password?
I think you can.
I just played spot the difference and failed.
Maybe it is more obvious in real life.
I made a mocha.
Hmmm, it was okay.
I prefer just coffee
I remember the days when broadband first started.
They kept upgrading the speed for free.
But yeah, may be free for a few months then not.
I mean they have throttling policies.
You have because we hit it when we were there together.
That is when we found out about it.
They have a chart on their website showing the time periods and limits.
Yeah remember when we could not even watch youtube videos?
I think I remember times when we knew it was throttling though, how else would I know about the chart?
Why.
We are going to the dentist tonight :S
Toka is getting her wisdom tooth out tonight.
She eats my foot a lot.
We will leave at about 9.
It is the weekend so free your schedule.
Where are you.
Sounds like being with daddy.
He never found anything I did funny.
Are you home yet?
We got lots of spices.
Just got a checkup at a dentist for the first time.
Things are fine, cost 5gbp.
Mummy finds things funny I think.
What the hell, polish and scale are how you keep your teeth from rotting long term.
Especially if you are not flossing.
Leave it a few years and the bits you miss each day will end up forming cavities and you will get ginivitis.
32k, no excuses any more.
I think not.
Attacks on what?
Have you not quit yet?
That person is going to go to jail.
Way to waste their life.
I do not know much about the police and how they work, but could you express concern to them and ask them if they are doing anything to make you feel safer?
Men fight back harder.
I think you should tell them everything but with the disclaimer, this is just what I have heard, I have no proof.
It could be useful.
It is their job to find proof and check the rumors for validility.
That sounds like a threat to me.
I would definitely tell them about that.
Who the fuck does she think she is.
To say that requires some sort of knowledge of intent.
Otherwise it is a threat, or a bad joke.
Let the police figure it out.
Morning shift psychos.
Toka make lentil soup.
Yeah it was good.
Lentils, carrots, a tomato, a potato, and onions.
Yeah when she just listed the ingredients just now the tomato threw me off.
Leaks yeah, but not sure about turnips.
Broth?
No no, I mean when you made that it was okay, but it felt wrong.
Oh yeah, no but we have all the ingredients.
So just boiled peas?
Carrot and coriander is my favourite hummous flavor.
I made some really good hummous recently.
Just threw it all together without measuring and blended and it was great.
We found a baking shop that is aparrently famous.
And it has everything for baking.
Good morning.
Golf with friends is on linux now.
Are you alive today?
Good morning.
I remade this.
I spent all morning making a picture of my keyboard layout :D
It always had a layout, but no one knew it but me.
There are more things than just that, but they are mostly linux related.
It looks nice though, right?
The graphic.
She will get the skin cut next week.
I made a picture of my keyboard layout.
It is a vector :sunglasses:
How are you today?
I would never work more than 38 hours a week.
38 is too much for me.
30 is okay.
And 20-24 would be great.
And an hour travel there and back is my limit.
I have 10 minutes break,, 25 minutes travel, and 390 minutes of work a day.
It is dinner time
I will be back in a bit.
Yeah no, look for a closer job.
I think there is no drm on the multiplayer.
Yeah it is hosted, it uses my linux account name.
The whole time.
I think you failed to improve anything.
I am good.
It is the weekend.
Did you like my new keyboard picture?
The first graphics config screen loaded on my old nuc at 22fps, and 46fps on my new nuc.
I still have not tried minecraft.
Did not test that either.
I doubt it will though.
They have been increasing the graphics a lot.
Go get "golf with your friends".
Oh actually, old nuc was 22 at 1280x1024, and new was 46 at 1920x1080.
Also, yep, no drm.
I will go get it again.
AppImage magic.
Yeah, go to the video options after then initial setup.
Want to play a game with toka?
And me.
Yeah.
Mumble?
Let me just download chrome.
6 minutes
Can Kirsty not play?
Let's try riot then.
What happened to all your monitors?
My name is Paul.
I FIGURED IT OUT
MUMBLE
Join mumble.
Where are you today.
Where were you.
I went to bed as soon as I sent it.
Did you get my voice message.
Okay wake up you have slept for 7 hours.
Nada.
Yeah, that is me.
THE FUCKING ROOF
What I am about to show you requires you to be listening to this:
For the second time in history, Paul's keyboard visualised.
Also, get Golf With Your Friends already.
Minigolf for Carioians.
You are coming in a butt?
First I have heard about this.
HOW DARE YOU MENTION GAY SEX AFTER JESUS CHRIST, PEACE BE UPON HIM
I am right now, as we speak.
Time to update riot web to 0.13
Can not be long until the next game now.
HI
Are you saving it.
Are you bringing lunch?
Hello.
I know how to use riot.
Calm down.
I just wanted to say hi.
Nope, he says it is not a problem yet.
It annoys me, but it does not hurt me.
Because it is a baby tooth, the solution is to take it out and have an implant.
And there is no need to take it out yet.
Was it worth while?
For what?
Tedx is so shitty though.
It has no standards.
Ted and tedx are very different.
Tedx will let anyone speak regardless of how stupid they are.
Also why are there interviews to join clubs.
I cut my finger cleaning the bath.
The handle of the brush was terrible.
Well, toka has no food.
Also, she said hurry the fuck up.
When I am hungry.
And I am hungry.
I have not had breakfast.
No idea, ask toka.
Good morning.
MOONING?
I am okay.
I think.
I am hungry.
I have not had breakfast yet.
Do you have nothing to do?
Do you want to do anything?
Do you need to do anything?
Well hop in your car and come to Cairo.
Like near me Cairo.
It was at 5pm?
Well this sounds like the start of a plan.
Unless you disappear.
We could meet after the interview.
You should find out if he can not wait for you before we continue planning.
Can you create something.
Where is the interview?
Can you pin point it on a map?
Fiiiiiiine, but you have to be awake and talkative instead.
Appimages are even cooler because you can share them across the network easily.
When I download a game, I just put a link in an export nfs share and toka can open it.
I bought peanuts to make peanut butter.
Where are you?
What is this?
Oh playing. I thought it was a game.
Which is watching?
I am so hungry.
Which was she watching?
I have frozen lentil soup.
Lentils, an legume I think.
But it is frozen. I do have fool though.
How do you feel tonight?
I think maybe I am always bored.
I just try to find videos to watch.
Hey. Did you get Life is Strange yet?
Also, if you can play Life is Strange, your laptop can play Golf With Your Friends with us.
Yeah.
I made the picture yes.
To show the layout I use.
No, but when people ask or wonder.
I can show them something now.
Some new shoes probably.
Did not have enough money when you came over.
But I will buy them to scotland and wait until someone visits.
Nah, I can wait.
There is no rain here so holes are not too bad.
Nah they are fine.
Well I never got two postcards lisa sent.
I am considering meganoodles.
35s, that is you.
I am making peanut butter.
Hello.
 I am so bored of peanuts now.
Yeah, I have to take the skin off all of them, and I eat the not perfect ones.
I gave up.
What will you do today?
Which relative is that?
The aunt that spoke to me?
I know two abdelrahmans.
Mohamed and Sayed.
The abdelrahmans that I know.
Do you want to hangout in a bit?
Do you want to now?
Or taken over by every home printer.
Oh.
75 for the mug included?
Okay.
What is the question.
You can do whatever else you are doing today, and if you pass any other places, check the price.
Then at the end pick.
I do not trust any of them if they do not give you choice of paper, ink, settings and so on.
You can just order?
It is not urgent is it?
What are you even printing on it?
Mugs are never a good gift.
Nobody opens a mug at christmas and wants it.
They add it to their 24 other mugs.
And keep using their favourite that they picked.
If they are essential, then the office should come with them.
I think buying something for your work is a sham.
I would be insulted by the expectation of that to happen.
Then I think you should not get anything.
Keep the money for yourself.
You were already shocked by how little you have left this month.
I am soooooooooooo hungry.
Gad?
You will be home soon with gad food that is hot?
Are you sure soon?
Because the ta3meya is defrosted.
And my stomach really hurts.
But you are going to the bakery.
So hot fool is good.
If you are going to the bakery, I am fine with our fool.
Okaieouy then.
Because it is weak and limits how fast they can get drunk, because they like the taste.
Beer is gross I think.
Yeah, most all things with alcohol taste bad.
But they drink it to get intoxicated.
Did you see the video I sent?
This looks like a new cartoon.
"I'm not sure that warranted a song."
I am waiting for toka to bring food.
Hopefully I make it.
I feel repeaty, but I am really glad we know each other.
Okay coffee time.
Has Hla made any nice paintings?
Wow, savage.
What does she try to paint?
Have you ever seen her paint things? Is this the first time?
Wait, she wanted your paint brush to do what?
Was it even the paint brush?
She is playing with lead and hot glue?
Oh you mean graphite, and an actual pencil.
I can not imagine it.
Will you send you too?
By cutting up paper into smaller paper?
Do you always get a custom card for your birthday?
Will I recognise you uncovered?
I will but I think you will look completely different.
Staaaaaaarrrrrrrrvvvvvvviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnggggggg.
A popup will appearing saying, "You have unlocked True Mariam".
It is always your choice.
It seems to annoy everyone.
Nada is super close to removing it but the family problems that would escalate.
I do not like her hair though :(
I think it is best when you are independant and your choice should only affect yourself, as it should.
I think it is too boyish, and I like very very short hair on boys.
That sounds very pedophilic, jeez.
On the chair.
Naaah.
Plenty of fool though.
I am waiting for you.
I want fool.
We need two breads.
Now I think your hair is exactly like Nada's since you wanted my opinion on Nada's.
But I know it is curlyish.
SEE YA
BYE HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME
I keep trying to convince toka to go shorter.
Looking after long hair is too much effort.
I will neeeeever know.
It is almost breakfast time.
I have the street food.
Oh wow they are nice.
Does she use them for anything?
Did you sleep.
In English?
Is it still sending?
Can she make computer parts yet?
Good morning.
Never heard of cointreau.
Are you fine today?
Nah it is okay.
<3
Are you alive today?
When are you home today?
Which event?
You should definitely test.
I hope you feel dandy, unlike when I eat all the candy.
What are you doing today?
I hope you are not busy, unlike my mother who is fussy.
Toka is back to work today.
Nope.
I have routine.
And very limited sunlight.
I am home.
When are you home.
I was late today.
ADA
SOMEONE MUST HAVE BEEN BORED <3
Come in mariam.
Where I lack in photos, I make up with recordings.
Baby.
Hello.
Hungry and thirsty.
My stomach is rumbling.
The cat is on me and I am lazy.
I had a little pizza thing.
Did you get my voice message.
Are you finer today?
I was going to make the peanut butter but toka left lots of bad nuts in it.
So I had to eat them all.
And now I do not want peanuts.
Still had skin on or too dark.
And then what?
I can not waste okay peanuts.
Also, I was hungry.
Where did you go.
Is it easy?
I guess the fool is almost defrosted.
Did you listen yet.
What is she studying?
A
Did you not listen.
Wake upppppp.
Mooorning.
It was on the wall :(
What outside one?
Yeah the poo was on the wall.
I am not downloading.
Check online for the dowload limit.

You should redeem the points now.
You get 1 point per pound spent or something.
Just whatever we can get.
They are linear in value.
Well we can get nothing without it.
Hello.
Sure.
But visit the branch...
Is that even worth 75egp?
Yeah.
LOVE YOU
You are going to be home when I am asleep at this rate.
I am okay today.
A little sore from the chair.
How are you?
It is cardomom they put in coffee here.
Maybe I should cook rice in coffee.
Okay no that tastes like rye bread.
And there is nothing I hate more than rye bread.
Oh wow.
What happened?
I think I do know quite a lot of basic stuff.
I usually do not speak though, just listen.
Sure 3L of coffee.
You would approve that.
I rarely dream of people I know now.
It is always child hood friends.
The glitchier ones?
I usually have them when I sleep forever.
More broken up.
Like a problem happened.
Mariaaaaaaaam.
Hello.
I came home earlier today.
I miss you.
How could you keep the recording this long.
When you send me one I rush to my headphones.
What about when you go to bed.
Toka is not home until late either.
I hope I do not bore to much.
We went over our 150GiB download limit so we have slow internet for four days :(
Because we can not get that speed.
Our line is pretty bad.
And 150 is usually enough.
Toka with her pc has been downloading a lot more.
Will you send happy you?
Will you send happy you?
Will you send happy you every day?
I think I am hungry.
<3
This looks like "happy" you.
Your riot photo looks like happy you, I think.
It is funny because favorite is American English, but Grey is British English.
We went over our download limit and now the internet is balls.
Been waiting two hours for a gradle sync.
I get the full speed back on the 24th.
I thought that past.
Cyber monday.
Did I have hair?
I can not even load it.
It is a pirate...
No work talk here.
This is a work free zone.
Using a brain?
There is no way to get a password back.
She should click forgot password on the riot.lost.host page.
And reset it with email.
I already told her that.
The username is "lisa"
Last week.
And the day someone breaks it the day the company fails.
Yeah do not click that.
Googling it.
It is vodafone sending configuration to your phone.
It is fine.
Come back.
The peanut blender keeps over heating.
It seems impossible.
I will make coffee.
When are you finished today.
Hello home.
How late.
In an hour or two means after midnight :(
Not yet.
The peanuts are taking too long.
I am going to have fool.
I am.
That is why it is taking too long.
It heats up too much.
I have another recording but I am having trouble uploading it :(
Did you sleep.
I can try to upload again. It seems to fail whenever I change tab or send a message.
Nooo it failed again.
PHEW
Oh wow. I should listen to it back when I have my headphones in.
I think I need hot chocolate.
Come one you are craving more voice note, I can tell, make a listening streak.
Because it is not a school, it is a center.
I do not like it.
Is it complete?
Are you up to date?
You mean you would not like more?
Wow.
Savage.
Damn, I knew I should have made it a greater duration.
I am still waiting for a video.
Or some type of virtual reality mariam system. A VRMS.
I have hot chocolate.
Are you... recording me a twenty minute message?!
I feel like you set the bar too high with your perfect message.
Oh that is not as exciting.
Maybe I want to clone you so one of you can be busy and the other is free.
Are you too slow, are the zombies catching up?
Too early for word cookie.
Be back.
Good morning.
Oh I saw it.
COMING HOME
Are you alive?
Wow ginger just drank so much she threw up off the edge of the seat.
My head is so sore.
Not even a coffee sore.
OH guess who has spare noooooodles.
I did not eat yet today.
It rained today.
First time in like 8 months.
Are you on the way there?
Are you fine.
Does it still hurt as much?
When you are with me?????
Yeah.
You can pop a pollup.
You can get colon cancer.
You could prolapse and get infected and die.
Why.
Well that was quick.
Is it a bloody mess?
ARE YOU GOING TO REMEMBER EVERY WORD YOU SAY?
Toka is dying.
Okay it is fool, hot chocolate and video time.
HELLO
She was in a lot of pain from the gum getting cut at the dentist.
She is trying to sleep now.
I have a lame recording.
I am too scared to send messages when it is uploading.
Have you had any teeth pulled out?
Have you ever been to the Street Dentist?
The dentist you find beside the watch repairer.
I think if my dentist ever failed something I would immediately look for a better dentist.
Where is happy you today?
It is like my dentist always says, "A Mariam a day keeps the lonely away"
But my doctor said, "One Mariam a day is better than every two days, unless you have a weak heart, then try to limit your dosage to once every two days."
I like to stick to whistling :D
And when I am glue, I like to stick to everything.
You shall.
You shall always without doubt.
Getting.
10KB/s :(
I am hearing you.
Your day sounds awful already.
Why do you need more beauty.
Marketing, tedx eww.
Did you see it rain today?
I always get into bed in my onesie and wake up an hour later to take it off.
Have I ever seen you in glasses?
By the time you end the messages you are talking at 18,000hz.
Mariaammmmmmmmm.
I am longing you.
It is bedtime.
I love you Mariam.
Good night.
Wake up.
ARE YOU STILL ALIVE
Trapped nerve?
No, I never noticed anything like that with his brother.
I know what a nerve is...
I read it, and now the internet is too shit to reload the plage.
But there was no mention of a desiese other than cerebal polsy there.
But it is not cerebal polsy, right?
Bell's palsy.
1.5% of people.
The doctor was meant to rule out those last things before diagnosing it as Bell's polsy.
No.
But he is aging.
Good morning.
Guess who is rewritting the cargo socket in Go?
The app is non functional.
Updating it.
Yeah they do not.
I have fabric set up on it.
I do not care about being able to make programs for other people.
I only know Go for writing software for myself.
And I only knew android for writing applications for myself, when I had an android phone.
Look how well iOS went for me.
It took me a day to learn how to use go.
Then I could write my own software.
And I am more interested in stuff that benefits me.
I think I would never learn a language if it was just for others.
I have no interest in the IOT.
I do not want everything connected to the internet.
I do not want data mining.
I want my computer to do what I want it to do.
Have you learnt assembly before?
HELLO
How are you.
I am not sure I am interesting in anything anymore.
Yep, jobs kill it.
Kareem is doing some Google Udacity thing.
I can not wait until the weekend is here.
I am so worn out.
I work from 10am to 4:30pm now.
It was getting too dark.
Do you have a plan?
Less than 24 hours a week?
I think less than 18 should be classed as part time.
24 should still be full time.
A bit anxious.
But the weekend is soon.
Are we meeting.
This is why.
No, I do not know why.
The internet is so bad here too.
I avoid showering because our shower is too bad.
It is the boiler.
Earlier than what?
I am at work.
Are you fine.
If it is Ball's polsy, it is fine though.
It is probably three weeks off work.
It is just creating types of classes with certain artificial responsibilities and restrictions in order to have code organisized in a way that is easier to read and test.
You should be able to understand how each one operates by looking at a diagram of each architecture.
Honestly it is just Object Orientated fanboy circle jerking.
Everything in OO is just awful.
People who like it seem to have no understanding of how languages work without the concepts.
When you look on your computer to see what programs you use are made in Java, you realise they are the worst ones, or there are none.
It just performs like dogshit.
Okay less ranting.
I know this project, hmmm I wonder if I can find it.
This is going to be hard to find.
This is the perfect example of why I hate the entire java scene.
A problem that should be one file, with 10 lines.
Obviously it exagerates, but you must be able to see where it comes from.
Oh I thought that you should have left.
Every time you see a new architecture it looks more and more like this, right?
But we use them to stop people making 1000 line files.
But then look at the android source.
A textview is like 5-10k lines.
MapViewModel is not even 1000 lines :D
Oh no.
 I just recorded a 40 minutes message, what have I done.
What is wrong with me.
I am home.
I will try to send it, if it fails, I will upload it to a server and send you the link.
What can you even expect from a message that long?
I have no idea.
Where is happy Mariam today?
When are you home?
Reeeeeeeeeeeeest time.
Did you get my "I am longing you" joke yesterday?
Did they not put in email address when they signed up?
His user name is `ian`
Okay so a definition of longing is:
The cat just knocked over my bike.
A strong persistent yearning or desire, especially one that cannot be fulfilled.
So I wrote your name really long: marrriiiaaaammm and said I am longing you, because your name is you and I am making it longer.
No.
I think it is one of the better jokes I have said.
I will be silent for a while while I try to upload it.
Oh that only took *forever*.
Hello?
Hello?
Where are you.
Hello?
You should be home any moment.
Crazy eyes meows at the door when you leave.
Mariam mariam mariam.
Did my message scare you away.
First rainfall this year two days ago.
Still planning to come in march time?
Wake up.
I am so sorry from sleeping so much.
March would be way too cold anyway.
It only just started getting cold.
Toka is back in work now.
She had the gum above her wisdom tooth cut two days ago.
I am fine. It is my weekend now.
I will never get used to the weird weekends.
Are you fine?
Here is crazy eyes this morning.
Lisa got a pretty great job, eh?
We actually had snow fall last April.
I stole toka's phone before she goes to work to take some photos.
How is Jane?
Toka wants to see the snow.
Sore, I meant to say sore.
She says "auwoauhuhah"
Looks too cold for me.
It is 21C right now and I am freezing in my onesie.
The cleaner has been on holiday for two or three weeks now so I have all the housework to do today :/
Up for some golf today?
I hear it is snowing.
I have not seen happy Mariam for two days :(
The only thing that can keep me warmish.
We will see how long this one lasts.
It was funny to see all the neighbours come out their windows for the first time.
Oh, our internet is shitty until the 24th.
We can try.
What about now?
I will make another coffee.
Up north has snow everywhere.
I am freezing at 21C.
This free coffee I got from toka's dad smells awful.
He did not like it so he gave me a pack.
100% coffee, how can it smell bad?
mumble
Fuck.
Wow you look completely different.
Hello?
Are you not getting a call here?
Good morning.
You said two days ago yesterday.
I slept for 12 hours.
You look like another person.
The closest :(
Did you listen to my message yet.
No you never look bad.
I think it is the glasses.
And I have never seen this jumper.
Have I seen your neck before?
Maybe it is your neck.
Am I just realising I have never seen your neck?
This is weird.
Your head is *attached* to your body?
Did I make you super worried about your neck?
:(
If you really want I can not, and you can delete the messages, but I like them :(
Okay delete them.
I am playing games with ben today.
But also have house work to do :(
Look at you thinking you have the best neck in the world.
Well, I forgot it now.
So I will just agree, best neck ever.
Are you off today?
Jesus it is slow.
Between 40-60 minutes
I will shower and have breakfast.
Download region - Egypt, what the hell.
Since when does egypt have a server?
Okay, using the uk is faster, just over 30 minutes.
I feel terrible today.
And my appetite has been gone for a week.
I do not know.
I am sneezing a lot, and I get this weird headache.
I hope you are fine.
Unlike my internet.
When will you listen to the message.
12m
Let us pray to the netcode gods.
Are you taking iron supplements these days?
Any clue how to get reddit to change layout style to something like cards?
Having one item on a row is just too wasteful at this resolution.
3 minutes.
I think you should.
I hope you are fine, not like my shower.
I hope you have power, unlike my shower.
I hope you don't forget, unlike my internet.
This is terrible, sorry.
Yeah I have all of my youtube subs in rss, because I do not have a youtube account.
More reliable way of seeing all your subscriptions.
BABY
GAMING WITH BEN
I spend 95% of my time in rss, reddit, and news.ycombinator
95% of my browser time that is.
Are you not home.
completely different drug, hold on
I do not remember, but I do remember it being 2-3 times more expensive.
Oh.
Just remember, 50% chance the speaker is an idiot.
What...?
Hahahahahah.
This is the EA comment.
Let me look it up.
Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol
Those are the drugs you take.
Generic Name: drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (dro SPY re nown, ETH in il, ESS tra dy ol)Brand Names: Gianvi, Loryna, Nikki, Ocella, Syeda, Vestura, Yasmin, Yaz, Zarah
I hate that they name it after shitty female names.
Hold on.
Yaz has 28 pills?
You can buy yasmin online.
I think yaz is the same, but the dosage is different, and the quantities of the two drugs may also be different.
Interestingly, the same pill is approved by the FDA for acme treatment.
24 days I think, it could mess up the rhythm.
If you can get it online, it could be easier.
Did you not order it by phone pretty easily?
yaz -Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg (as betadex clathrate) / Drospirenone 3 mg
Almost the same.
yasmin has 1.5x as much ethinylestradiol.
That was the seller listing it on yaoota.
It is sold as a combined oral contraceptive under the brand names Yasmin (US, EU, Latin America), Jasmine (France), Yarina (Russia)
Tut
So drugs with the same dosage are yasmin, yarina, jamine, safyral, estradiol, ocella, syeda, zarah.
You can get any of those, they are exact.
Yeah, I just checked and none are on yaoota.
But you should just remember 3mg drospirenone/0.03mg ethinyl estradiol.
Then when they offer a different brand, check the box for the ingredients.
You are one that quantity of drug for 21 days every 28 days.
Why are they so stupid?
Are they trying to get people pregnant?
I would just come home, make a list of parmacies that deliver and call them.
If a place has them, order as many as they will sell you.
Who cares if we buy 12 packs.
A shop that does not want to sell its product is a mismanaged shop.
That is also completely stupid.
I am so hungry.
fateeeeeer.
But when will you be home?
Watch that video.
At 35 seconds.
Thinking thing inversed.
Me and toka had to pause to check if it was you.
You should show mummy the video and tell her a video of you in Thailand was featured in a video.
The bus will never not get there though.
That is forever away.
It comes with a cleaner?
When the seasonal guys leave, they give you a tiny bus.
Just found out I can set my bios logo to anything.
Any ideas?
this
Yeah that looks suficciently swag.
What is this.
Why did they use java.
What is this?
How was the event?
Am I too miserable?
I woke up.
I do not get it, the java server only just implemented pistons, but the client has pistons.
Since when was there a standard api for minecraft?
I think the internet is back.
I have until around midday.
And then I am back at around 2-3 your time.
The internet is back.
Yeah.
If you can play now, just give me a moment to brush my teeth and get coffee.
Call me?
33b13a01-85e2-4c20-ba2d-02cac3ebf6d3
a09acf0233b51be7 - network id
r2X8xswgEmjxGqPqrgTAnAGFyWQHrbVG - your access token
Not figured it out yet, but leaving now.
I think the access token is not needed.
Only 100x faster than me.
What is the upload?
Can you hangout this evening?
Did you not say you were enjoying 15?
Lost odyssey was the best.
I barely remember it.
I got to the final part then grinded to 99.
But never finished it.
Jesus.
I am not sure I would like the story of any of them if I played them today.
But I do want to try 12 again.
I have played it half way twice.
Utopia gives to evil guys decent reasoning.
But not a game.
Hello.
I am home.
sudo zerotier-cli join a09acf0233b51be7
What the fuck?
You call.
Well, if I can get it working at all.
mumble
0% lost packets but it stops working.
Let me restart the router...
ip addr
Maybe it is every time I change zt0...?
A SOCKS proxy for all the vpn traffic.
Okay got it.
Wow.
Wow.
The internet is not usually this shit.
Going to ping you for a while.
Are you not on zerotier?
What happened there.
DOUBLE PROXY ALL THE WAY CROSS THE WIRE
Yeah, they are stupid.
Pretty sure you could destroy te egypt by making an account with '; drop table users;'
I set up a openvpn 2.4 configuration if you are interested.
You are not here?
Not really.
Working on something though.
Another server.
Using all the top notch encryption methods.
Oh yeah this does not work using vpn.
mumble.
I mean, is it working?
This site fails to load for me.
Wow I think they are blocking all vpn related sites too.
Looks like it.
My vpn stopped working around that time.
I have a solution though.
Banning openvpn just makes me want it harder.
What.
Ovh servers have a 3ms ping to 8.8.8.8, and I never tested other sites.
But the digital ocean vps is 0.3ms to 8.8.8.8, and about 1ms to everywhere.
Gave up and setting up this.
Tried both stunnel and obsfproxy with openvpn, they worked but the ufw config was not working.
This script is SS class automation so far.
Upgraded to batshit-insane class.
Where are you.
Did you show mummy?
The video.
This will be the thailand magnet all over again.
Worked flawlessly.
Seems better.
Using wireguard instead of openvpn though.
It is almost bedtime.
Fully automatically sets up a server for you.
Then generates all the custom configs and gives you a nice looking guide for using the services on all platforms.
striesand
legwarmers-Marjorys-thunderboxes-boosts
Yeah, and live five alternatives.
It went through like 200-300 steps.
It did everything.
I think I like wireguard most though.
I tried to play a game most of it and failed most of it.
It is bed time.
What is not on the list?
It was.
Hi.
I did nothing. Not even log in over ssh.
Do not know much about it.
But it worked without hitch.
It set up openvpn to use tcp.
So I can try both tomorrow.
Bed time now.
I really hope that last half is true.
I stopped using openvpn because it would not reconnect after dropping a connecting.
:D
If you want to use any of those, feel free.
But the openvpn profiles, use the 5th config, I guess.
vpns worse than pirating in egypt
Being gay is easier to conceal.
They do not get true deep packet inspection.
Hi.
Escape from what.
Oh.
Yeah, super busy.
How are you?
Busy :(
But I just finished the cargo socket :D
There are still a few tasks but they are non essential for the operation.
Where are you?
Toka got new super cat litter, the cats haircuts, and the cleaner is back.
And fixed the shower pressure.
A flat above us is flooding.
It is a community investigation now.
I think you mean, "I want to breeeaak freeeeeeee".
Want to play some golf?
Kotliks-enzymatically-peppery-cliometrician
omg
Wow.
Hello.
I am so cold.
The cats are sleeping on the soft bed blanket.
`sudo cat /etc/wireguard/wg0-client.conf`
`sudo ls -lah /etc/wireguard`
I spent almost a whole day trying to set up stunnel and openvpn.
Wow, that worked.
Call when you are back.
Are you fucking kidding me.
I just found the problem for all my network problems.
You are going to love this one.
Where is happy you?
Mariamriam.
Breaaaaaaaaaaaad.
a
Are you just never here.
Noooodles.
Baaaby.
You are really happy.
I feel sad for some reason.
You roughly there.
Right at DOt Sense.
I think.
Oh no, I am lost.
Not there.
Hold on.
No.
Yeah, the map is right.
I am not sure.
Something to do with you being so happy, but not usually.
Maybe.
No no.
Maybe I feel like I never make you that happy.
Maybe but I have not seen you smile like that with me.
And if I did it was so quick.
Oh wow <3
We will have to start builing you a room.
We got our shower fixed.
Now it is brutalally fast.
Okay I just want to see it more.
I am fine.
<3
Well you better prepare because I want so much stuff.
Actually, not really, I have a lot already.
But I am sure I can find new things :D
10 more minutes of work.
Why?
You could go anyway.
He is only going to be in cairo for two days.
Then we will head to el gouna with him for a weekish.
But until flights are booked, there is no plan.
Tokatokatoka
Okay, well I am going home now.
Hi.
I am sorry. I just worry some times.
I am home.
And hungry and sweaty.
Are you playing a thousand miles?
And may-june is ages away.
Streets of Rogue in thirty minutes?
Wireguard worked great at work, even with shitty wifi that drops all the fucking time.
I worry you will get bored the message is so long.
Life workarounds.
We have no bread or juice.
I am dying.
Working around not being able to respond in real time.
I have water and two bananas.
They invited us to el gouna.
I wish someone would clean all day here.
Is it because you live in a mansion?
Nah.
:( no
Why is it so cold.
The shower got fixed and now it is good.
And we got new cat litter that smells really nice.
But also they are planning 3 weeks I think. Which would mean a month off work for you, which is insane.
I finished playing a game with ben.
Do you live in a giant car?
Yeah.
But also clearly not all about seeing me.
2/21ths.
I said new litter.
Not a new litter tray.
Oh no wait.
Jeez.
A detatched house.
That is just creepy living with another family on another floor.
What if they drill holes in the roof and spy on you.
My hands are so cold.
It is 19C in here.
I am still so hungry.
Nothing.
Fool and ta3meya at 11am.
Yeah but you have heating.
19C is a cold room.
I am lazy to cook and there is nothing to just eat.
Still at work.
I think I will starve.
I think I will make hot chocolate and have a shower.
When are you home.
I can have a cucumber.
But it will not fill me.
Actually I had the two bananas.
Nope.
I have peanut butter and fool I could have.
Not at the same time; I am not a murderer.
Oh wow.
Okay that warmed me up.
I think you will never find time to listen to 40 minutes.
You can just write back at the same time.
Okay my hands are getting cold again.
I was showering less and less because it was so bad.
But now that it is super fast and hot, I think I will shower every day again.
Hot chocolate now.
The tap part at the bottom was most of the issue.
And he did something outside too.
Nothing to do with the flooding building yesterday sshhh.
The plumber.
And everything.
Or noodles.
Maybe some babaganoug.
Or bitengen.
Some hot fool maybe.
SEE YA
Hla can help.
Yeah kitchen is part of the home, jeez.
Wake up.
You know it girrrrrrrrl.
Was it not too hot for you?
Could you run a command on my computer?
`cd qmk; git add .; git commit -m "push for paul"; git push origin master`
I think.
Not too bad.
Finally found someone to swap pcs with at work so now I have linux back.
How are you?
I am perpetually ill with the cats in the house :/
I am living on anti-histamines.
Nah I think they are worth it.
I think I will start getting the cleaner every week instead of fornight, that should help a bit.
I did see you dressed up as an elephant I think.
It was ages ago now.
Oh no the second track was ruined.
I was invited to a 5 mile run last friday but I thought I would just die.
I know I can do it but it is painful.
I think you two will be crawling across the finish line in those costumes :D
Last time I ran with lisa she could not make it from hopeman to comingstone.
It is like one great song, then the next is ruined.
Where is the run?
When is nairn going to get a bypass, jeez.
Oh wow. that will be great.
Where are you.
Okay never mind.
Ready for around 3:30 your time?
I could have got the bread but there is no spread so I thought there is no point.
I just have to keep my nails cut.
She does not clean any cupboards.
I thought we all knew that.
But not much.
:/
The proto is a submodule of the server and mobile now.
Then you can `cd libero-proto; make dart` and it will put the dart grpc files in the correct place.
I was getting annoyed with the go and dart files clashing in editors.
Finally.
Say something simpler like, I am the sister of Paul Meredith.
Mariaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam.
Hmmm.
There are extensions for chrome and firefox that let you find rss feeds on a page easily.
Dev is every week.
What?
Receive what?
The pills?
You ordered mashy?
From who?
Okay.
How much is it?
Just make sure who ever is delivering knows you will pay later.
I do not want to be stuck in a situation were they will not leave and we can not communicate.
To cover the mashy?
Okay.
What about the bag of tomato stuff?
Maybe I will message in a bit as I fall.
Yeah.
It is cooking.
Mariam mariam.
Yeah the lazy fever.
Yes.
Maybe I am falling.
But I need to pee.
"They are all fake, I can tell"
I was just in a call with ben and it was fine.
What happened.
FAKE COUGH
DISTRACTED
I am not sure if you are calling on the phone or the laptop.
Actually, that was odd.
I could hear him way more than you.
I will check the ma7shy.
WHO IS MAZEN
I remember making a joke about amazen.
I do not want to know, this is too many people.
Only...?!
Maybe you are already gone.
When are you home.
No I am joking.
I do not think that at all.
I feel like I was quite sarcastic.
Enough to detect.
It is bed time.
THE MA7SHY IS READY HURRY
I made the ma7shy great.
For me I think either I talk to you irregularly and do not care about you, or regularly and really care about you.
But I think if you have too many regular people it is very easy for people to slip to irregular.
So I like to keep it 1 or 2.
And people with orthagonal interests.
So I would never say something to one that I could have said to any.
That keeps it regular.
I only know me and hazem
Yeah but not for long.
It is bed time.
Yeah you should force your self back to sleep.
This internet is going to ruin you.
siifiisoft
Wake up.
Where are you today?
Good morning.
<3<3
I forgot how big the cargo code was :(
I am going to try a quick rewrite of all the map and socket stuff.
I am waiting for home time.
It is almost home time.
Did you stay at home again?
Which days are meant to be your free days?
So to remember it I can use M x M x P P x starting sunday.
Max Max PPX
No I will never remeber it.
Actually I can remember that.
30 minutes?
And by my calculations, we should meet on thursday or friday.
The download speed.
Full throttle 220KiB/s.
Just this one?
I will blast it while I shower.
Well yeah, you would use the appropriate equivalents.
You should try the `l` command.
Steam does not scale for me.
Quite a few things do not scale correctly.
I just use the .Xresources file
But some things are just fucked in programs.
Not even the whole ui is fucked.
Steam just ignores it.
Freezing here.
The weather says 30 next week though.
Okay it is super shower and super clothed time.
650MiB so far.
1h10m
Any big changes recently?
It was unplayable on my hd5000.
The water really killed it.
Actually, it was smooth indoors.
But any scene with water was too low.
Yeah, I did, but to make it playable, it looked like shit.
I hope so.
I love the shower now it is fixed.
Maybe 45 minutes is too long though.
What does she have?
Imagine a game tracker that was specialised for shit connections.
Wow.
Everything was stripped and pigzed.
I might recompress this rar file for fun as zpaq and see how low it goes.
Also, do you know about upx?
It can compress binaries really well.
To 15-30% percent of the original most of the time.
And it is still executable, decompresses when it runs or something.
I use it to upload binaries.
Pretty psyched.
Are you off to the dentist now?
No go to bed.
Do you not use a regular alarm?
I set my alarm every night to between 7-8 hours.
Always in bed between 11 and 1.
You should try install fish: `yay -Sys fish`
Then run `fish` in a terminal.
Self harm is never a solution.
Get help.
Anything that wont work on linux wont be worth doing.
fish is not a gui.
You can use wine to run windows programs on linux.
But you would be a dirty person.
What does that mean?
Okay well try to be a decent person and stop doing that.
Clear the password/cookie whatever.
That is so unhealthy.
And violating.
Tell her what you are doing and see if she gets hurt.
:D
I already tried it.
I just do not find moba games fun.
My attention is too short.
Yeah, but it repeats.
I like rhythm games.
And grand stragegy.
And rouge-lite.
I play a lot of stepmania.
I did when it came out.
I liked starcraft too.
And age of empires 2.
The whole story of "red" alert pisses me off now though.
I was being fed anti-communist propoganda when I was a child.
Command and conquer: red alert was the one I played.
Yeah but I assume the one in your home directory overrides the system one.
:(
The game runs really well on this computer.
What, no, my new nuc.
My old nuc never played it well.
But I always use the new nuc now.
If that is what you mean.
You better not play without me; the journal is shared.
We should go through all the settings before starting.
I have my super thick jumper on under my onesie.
Why is it so cold.
uhhhh?
AHHHH SHOWERED
Wake up.
Holy shit yeah I saw the teaser.
No body fucking expected that.
I have probably watched more spelunky than played minecraft.
Are you fine though?
IT IS THE WEEKEND
I am home.
JUST FOR ME
Okay yalla.
xom
Almost ready for morrowwwind.
I am sooooooooooo tired.
All I did the second time was use one thread.
No rape.
So about four times longer, just over an hour.
64s
Nothing.
Are yo uhome?
Maybe but the selection looks low.
Going for the max compression morrowind.
It is 2.1GiB uncompressed.
976MiB.
I might be able to go smaller.
It is still compressing.
947MiB
Obviously.
I wonder how small you could make it with just the base game.
What is wrong now?
I woke up.
The cats mess with my sleep a lot.
It will just go to savings for now anyway.
But thanks.
I barely spend anything any more.
You will stay home today again?
Twhs
Now you are just baiting me.
Absolutely nothing.
**HELLO**
Who?
Sure.
Toka will be at work though.
Good.
Jesus.
So anything else is game?
Actually, Nada just said she is coming over to play life is strange later.
Yes.
What will you do today?
Weeeeeeeeekend.
Why is it so cold.
Which days are your weekend?
Well that is easy to remember.
I am going to try to find all the clothes.
I can barely feel my fingers and toes.
30 minutes 0AD?
Or maybe 1 hour actually.
I have a onesie, but I need to find my under trousers.
It is what?
My weekend is not even the normal here.
It is the hardest thing to ever get used to, switching week start day.
heathren makes sense.
But pagan I still do not get.
pagans worshiped multiple things
But heathren could also mean a person who believes in the wrong variation.
How I see this is that the weekend is the religion.
And I am heathren because I have the wrong weekend.
Someone who has a broken weekend like monday and wednesday off, they would be pagan.
I am here.
I know someone who has that.
I think I would prefer a more spread out work rest.
3 days work, 1 day off, 2 days work, 1 off.
Actually, 2 days work, 1 off, 2 days work, 2 off.
Wednesday an extra day off.
6 hour days for a total of 22 hours work.
30 minutes break at hour 2:45 of each day.
I am not sure I could push for shorter hours any more.
I am at 32.5, I think 30 would be the limit, I would have to go for pay increase then.
Almost everyone is working 48 hour weeks here.
Legal maximum.
They are not good at defending themselves.
And unions seem to not exist.
But just going to get food.
I will be here in 40ish minutes.
a
Hello woke up mariam.
Did you ever finish the message.
An eta?
Not a time.
Oh this is nice.
I just played a game called everything.
Hi.
I never listen to the messages before sending them.
I finally got all teh food.
You would be Mariam.
You are *the* Mariam.
Me and Salma played a game called "Everything".
Okay now I can get back to recording shorter messages.
One of toka and nada's friends.
I have only had a cucumber and a tiny bit of soup.
I need coffee and so much food.
When will you sleep.
Hmmmmmmm.
You become everything.
And dance and sing.
And think.
I forgot to have coffee all day but the morning.
And now my head is so sore.
My throat hurts.
It is social issues that get me the most at work.
If I fall out with someone or do not like someone.
Hard work I can deal with.
Just stop speaking to them from now on.
Permanent silent treatment works best for me.
Actually, I shouted at the designer last week.
He would not leave me alone so I got angry and told him to fuck off.
But I apologized in the morning.
Are you super fine?
Are you feeling any better?
I did not mean to compare, I but shouting and designer triggered a story.
Do you have nice people there?
I get the job of helping everyone else.
About 40% of my time is that.
Magdy wants most of my time doing it, but I do not have the time.
There were loads of interviews last week.
Probably, we have quite a few beginners but Eslam seems to do all the work.
We have a HR and business development person now.
And four servers :D
Abdelrahman has been customer service for ages.
Our two cats are super hyper right now.
I do not know.
Maybe 1.
Nope.
Only on every second friday.
Here but nada and two of her friends came over.
I am all fed.
Video or voice?
I remember the last time we called while toka was here and you ended up leaving.
I really want to but now is the wrong time.
Will you be here in 30 minutes?
I will try to be here with full attention.
I am here.
Oh I went to bed.
My stomach hurts a little and my throat too.
Maybe, but I never noticed symptoms and it should take one or two days for the virus to be strong enough to cause symptoms for me.
Are you the finest?
Why not.
You never came to join the game.
Why are you not the finest?
I keep falling.
No please do not be sad and bored.
I feel slightly responsible for the bored and sad.
I want to video call so much.
Jesus :D
Where are you.
Yes  I am very close.
I can not last longer.
Until the morning Mariam.
Be finer.
Be herer.
Did you sleep before me.
Nope my throat is killing.
Larypro.
It is all we have.
Good morning.
I am so sneezy and a sore throat.
Nada and her friend are over again but I am not in the mood for people any more.
Well, other people.
Are you better today?
I think I will need extra coffee this morning.
I am scared I upset you.
Okay good :)
They are gone now.
I think I will try a different linux system today.
Pure did olive spread.
Yeah my toes all swell up.
It is very important not to write any new data to the section of the drive that was formatted.
No.
I would also mention you live rent-free after the no financial commitments.
Maybe deformalise the  are directly related to the writer through the medium of sibling sentence.
He shits himself when you wake him up.
What a long long day.
Because I was sleeping too much, I actually started staying up to 1:30am every night now.
Also, always right click and reformat with dartfmt before commiting.
Every change should be one thing.
Why?
I am okay.
Try a load of passwords.
It is the email she signed up with.
The Handmaiden
I changed my schedule.
If you are coming to Friday Flutter Frenzy, this makes no difference, but I updated the flutter channel to dev because aparrently it is pretty stable and it had a fix I wanted.
Good morning.
Hurry and finish the exam.
And a 150% day on wednesday.
Yeah, just now.
Do they have sunflower spread and hummous?
Lulu had quite a lot, but it has too many people advertising things.
They expanded a bit.
Okay packing up and leaving.
Why?
Yeah, hurry.
Concerned should not have a capital letter.
You get 26,692 gross or net?
You never introduced yourself either.
How are you?
Yeah, I had porridge and nuts.
Or if you need any apis, I can work on those :D
Or is it the exam tomorrow.
I will go to bed.
How are you.
I only slept six hours last night :/
Oh yeah? Well I only slept four hours.
Tomorrow I am going with toka and her mum to a shop.
Oh, I will leave in 25 minutes.
I was home at 3.
So when you clone the mobile, you will run `git submodule update --init` to get the proto module.
I already told her it is not her email address.
Print then scan.
You can start the paragraph with, "I am Lisa Meredith, sister to Paul Meredith, and sister-in-law of the Applicant Toka-Abdelqader.
You should be here for the rest of the night.
Why are they?
New version of what?
Release is every year.
`flutter channel dev`
Then just play around and try maybe to add a listview to the main screen.
Shhhhh.
Because it is hot?
Okay.
Just exploring things.
I have ubuntu installed on two servers, and arch on four servers, and arch on all the home pcs.
I did too.
I will start trying to install it now.
I will try to be back as soon as possible.
My nose is a waterfall.
A cold I think.
Mariam mariam.
I think this is the first time I have seen you send an angry face.
Or maybe even a face.
So not yet.
Moved it to dart2.
I miss you.
EASEUS file data recovery or something.
I separated the server/proto/mobile.
I noticed this bug today.
It is taking forever.
It has to download everything.
And it downloading a quarter the speed for whatever reason.
Can I download you Mariam?
Come back.
Use a password manager.
I do not have long left.
I am here.
I just got home.
Hangouts.
Did she bring blueberries?
`flutter upgrade`
I am using whatever works.
Also, make merge requests for even the smallest of things.
I have a 90 day streak on duolingo now.
Wake up.
Yeah.
I am home.
This was my favourite.
Is that not today?
A fan is good enough I think.
No way.
Last year ceiling fans were 200-450.
My face feels like it wants to sleep.
It is so funny when you catch crazy sleeping on the bed when you come home.
I am here.
There is a fix I want in master too, but I will wait, hmmph.
Hi.
Something like lulu.
It seems for cooking only it is so bad.
Maybe.
Can you finish the letter today?
Probably a typo.
I think it was almost 40.
Sweaty, but calming.
Hmmm.
I would try to understand the code so far.
Or rowing.
Why were you trying.
How are you going to install something while not being at the computer?
Just got home from work.
I will judge lulu tomorrow.
Oh no it will be awful. 
Being with more than one person just makes me mad.
My nose :(
If I get sick I am going to quit food.
I am so sleepy, I might sleep.
I am knackered.
Are you fine?
Yes.
Beta is every month I think.
Or maybe design the navigation header.
The navigation drawer was so so so easy to add.
Hahaha no.
If I add a navigation drawer, you should be able to see the commit, read the short changes to be able to understand how I added a drawer.
An install image.
There is not download involved in the install.
Yeah, I do a half day on monday to see toka more.
I have never found dairy-free ice cream here either.
AC must cost 200 a month to run on electricty.
Are you on the wifi?
Making a Murderer.
Tell your mum to get a hobby.
I am mostly just focusing on the login and register.
Yeah, as long as you pull all the time.
So she is out every day.
I have some fancy ass password validation in the register screen now.
I will download the full debian image for an offline install.
I am putting the installer on the pen drive.
To install on your pc.
I will go home in an hour.
Tell her to start karate.
Toka is out with her friends
I am having fateer.
You could not sleep because of an endless stream of rss feeds.
I will get a big file that lets you install debian (the operating system I am using at home) from a pen drive without using the internet (which is very slow).
Remember the answer is the inverse of the contrast.
Come in.
Are you home.
But it is disgusting.
I am home.
I am talking about ceiling fans here.
This morning the cleaner woke us up.
Okay.
I am looking at the proof of employment.
The supplementary document is not signed either.
What.
Ali needs to hurry.
I am hooooooooooome.
Do you have a break?
What is sleep?
Like margarine, but sunflower, olive, or soya.
Good luck finding love.
I did not enjoy my time.
I mean, we rent and we put two in.
Yes.
It cost 33.
Do you live close to it?
Thank you.
Yeah, 1000egp notes.
Oh wow.
It is in the data partition.
Yeah this is the correct one.
Are you finished yet.
I am okay.
Hungry hungry.
I am trying to super relax.
I am excited to sleep tonight.
And to have breakfast in the morning.
Maybe.
I want to submit it today since there are only 4 days left.
Or good luck in your exam.
A fan just costs 200 to get and install, if I remember correctly.
Check an electric shop, they are pretty cheap.
Is it a high ceiling?
The driver was fine.
I need to relax hardcore.
Yes.
I have never ever seen vegan spread here.
sudo chown kareem:kareem /dev/kvm
I did find some long life jarred hummous.
Toka is going out this evening.
Are you here.
Okay.
Do you have a money printing machine up there?
Toqa.
Scan it and print 100 copies.
My nose is non stop :(
Hi.
I have used almost a whole tree of tissues,
A have to go to work soon :(
The cat is in heat and it is so annoying.
We need to get it neutered.
The female reproductive cycle of cats
I am not sure what they do to females.
Are you better yet?
I just want to be anywhere warm.
It is my birthday soon.
Nothing I suppose,
I will be back in 20 minutes.
I am.
Will you be free today?
I mean to talk.
I wish I could stay at home.
My face and nose.
But also I only got 5 hours sleep because of the cat.
We need to take ginger to the vet to get neutered.
She is too annoying.
Meows non stop.
Unprofessional :/
Come in.
It is almost home time.
I AM SO HUNGRY
There was no break fast today.
And the cat forced me to get up at 7.
I finally logged into riot on my computer.
Bring tissues :(
Maybe.
LOVE YOU
Yeah saw that.
Not forcing gui users to set a root password is a mistake.

USA
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the corporate tax rate would bepermanently lowered from 35% to 20%, while future foreign profits ofUS-based firms would be mainly exempt from tax.
xom
I gave up.
Oh I made a recording but it got lost.
:(
Still to see the spider mech.
I switched the riot and matrix server.
Did you update?
Wake up.
hi
Baaaby.
test
Hello.
Pretty good.
My nose it not running any more.
I am glad you managed to connect.
I was afraid I messed it up.
Are you fully better now?
What will you do today?
Work work work.
Almost not work.
Will we hangout today.
I hope so.
I will be home in about 40 minutes.
Preparing to shut down now.
But it is now?
Email is dead yes.
Well, no.
Sending email is dead right now.
Actually, I need to remake your email account.
I woke up this morning and switched servers.
Send your password here and I will move the mail to the new server when I get home.
IS IT THE MASHY
I will not guess.
I am coming home now.
I am home.
You had ma7shy without me? :O
No, I will wait until I get hungry and heat it up.
Well no it is cold.
Only freshly cooked mashy is the best.
Try the mail now.
Your mailbox is huge, jesus.
I move email and riot away from the server in the house.
I think that kind of double loaning has a word.
Not double origin, but back to the original.
That or I have come across a different one before and probably told toka like you told me.
Do you ever use ben@lost.host?
I moved the mail to a droplet and if you use it, I will copy the mailbox across.
I hope you are not here and not that you are not getting notifications.
What no, you can delete them.
I am not reading your mail.
It is not a problem the size.
Always?
Okay.
<3
I would never let another Mariam on here.
There is only enough room for one.
It
is not as bad.
Do you still meow non stop?
Oh no.
I am pretty good at making them.
When is it for?
But applying when?
If we met in person with a laptop, it would be nice and easy.
Sure.
I am ready to hangout forever.
You are okay to ssh in and change your password?
If so send your public key.
`ssh ben@lost.host:2020` then `passwd`
Going to run some mail and rss sites now that I am using caddy.
I hated using php before because it was a pain in the ass.
But caddy makes everything easy.
I need your public ssh key first.
Then known_hosts may make the connection fail since the ip changed.
That is gpg?
ssh
`cat ~/.ssh/id_25519.pub`
probably
triple back ticks
It is missing the key type
This is mine.
Okay go ahead and try.
We use the same type.
I saw that.
Nope just `rm -i ~/known_hosts`
Unless you want to keep it.
Just delete the line that is the server then.
In the `.ssh/config` file.
**Mariam runs away**
That sounds like what someone who is running away would say.
Output of `ssh-add -l`
`ssh-add`
You may be missing the program to enter the password.
x11-ssh-askpass
Oh let me set it.
`gayboi`
I do not use the default ubuntu shell.
But I think it has something to do with your terminal.
Arch is my favourite for servers still.
But digital ocean do not have arch.
And ubuntu is suprisingly good with the packaging.
I think they came around after that event.
I can see exactly what is running on the server.
I would not trust the desktop ubuntu.
But server stuff is completely different.
The only thing arch has going for it on servers is rolling release.
Ubuntu here is just apt + ubuntu repositories.
Better stop using duckduckgo then.
And delete your google account.
Why would you trust the 100 odd arch maintainers?
reproducible builds is the solution to the trust issue.
There is no public record of shit in the ubuntu repositories either.
Just the desktop selling user data.
Which is was such a big deal because this is the foss community.
It literally happens every site you visit.
I did set up matrix on it, but it was being an ass.
The creator of duckduck go made a living before it selling user data.
Nothing.
But the guy either had an epiphany or is dodgy as fuck.
But since there is no evidence, I am fine.
startpage has a better reputation I think.
They are not.
They are 4th.
Mint is at the top and they really do not deserve it.
Their site got hacked and fake isos were downloaded.
Digital ocean does debian.
Ubuntu, debian, freebsd, coreos, and centos.
I tried debian and freebsd first.
Ubuntu does a lot of configuration for you with apt.
And when it comes to running a server, the less you have to do and worry about the better.
I want to be able to update matrix automatically.
Not have to run a custom script to pull in random ass python dependencies with pip.
If there are breaking changes, ubuntu deals with everything.
The same can be said for debian, since they both use apt.
Debian was lacking something, I forgot what now.
Having firewall rules automatically managed by the package manager is also very useful.
I have never used the desktop version.
s
Yeah.
Arch has that sweat sweat aur for fucking everything.
Which is why it is still my first choice.
A command line client?
Wait, how do those aur packages work?
Having the package manager deal with games would be great.
3 is manjaro, 5 is antegros, which are both Arch based systems I think.
Surprising that they are so popular now.
Two people at work use Manjaro.
It is a nooby arch.
Honestly, I just hate everything that is not my exact dwm.
Fuck every attempt at automounting too.
mount, sync, umount
I tried guixsd again recently.
Bit of a bitch though.
Then I tried nixos which was more hopeful, but the install kept failing. It was trying to chmod 10444 a ro squashfs mount.
I would like to get nixos running though.
Being able to deploy my exact system with a single file would be dope.
The Gnu operating system.
To be fair, linux is gnu.
Wait, you might be right.
Yeah it is seperate.
Thank god, I do not want linux rewritten in guile with emacs being the only shipped editor.
Do you use vi?
Yeah.
In high latency connections vi is great.
Knowing all the readline commands is great too.
Also, I program each day.
You managed to change your password, right?
Trying to find which web mail client to use.
I liked squirrelmail, but the last update is 6 years ago, which scare me a little.
mail.lost.host
YES
I thought you would never ask.
A phrase.
I exposed my real address.
But text is better than no text.
It failed here.
You try.
To the google hangouts machine.
It says user_media_failed for me.
**HELLO**
Things I like about Mariam Morad:1. Her name.2. Her voice.3. Everything else.
Hmmm.
You try.
Hangout.s
That was <del>creepy</del> fine.
Mariam *ended* the call.
:(
You are still off though, and still here, I hope.
Did you hangup?
> How do you bold - Mariam Moraaaaaaaaad
Okay.
Going to heat the ma7shy soon.
I was always habibik
I do not object.
What.
I thought you were calling me.
If that is her *real* name.
It feels like exploration to me.
Like a text adventure game.
> You are approached by a Mariam, she says ,"Hello". She has a bottle of pineapple juice in her hand.
*say hi*
This cat look the same as all the cats toka's parents produce.
*ask for juice*
> She runs away
*chase*
> She gets in a cyan car and drives away.
* chase*
*chase*
> She hits a fork in the road and stops to think
*adopt*
*take bus to the hotel place*
The seat next to the hotel.
Not a hotel, jeez.
IT IS JUST A GAME
Okay this time the game is two player.
You use > Mariam goes to the shop
And I will play the game.
* tell to stop crying
* give special K*
*give special K*
*shug*
*take special k*
Oh the ma7shy.
Yes.
It was close.
Will you send you?
As long as it is not crying on the floor you.
**VERY DARK** is fine.
Well, obviously not ideal.
The serious is clearly more interesting than *ME*.
They will not because sham marriages are bad.
**spoiler**
But, they do go for sushi.
The cat is nodding off in front of the monitor.
And the sushi chief teaches them the true meaning of marriage.
But *can* you really imagine?
Are you not too old to have that skill?
It keeps every minute or so stretching being like, "WHAT, I am fine."
Then it starts slowly falling again.
It is standing up.
The sushi chief told me to watch it.
Yes, as a 20 year old living with my parents, I really connect with this story.
Hey my birthday is soon.
This friday.
With your imaaaaaagination.
No, it is not my birthday yet.
I am getting sleepy.
Where are you Mariam.
I wish I had a little computer I could use to talk in bed.
It is way more comfortable.
I will probably put on a video in a little bit and fall on the couch until toka comes home.
What no.
You should never say goodnight.
You should say stay a bit longer.
You should only say goodnight after I have fallen.
Are you french yet?
I stole the blanket and took it to the living room.
I nabbed it.
Is this one of the thoughts?
I think you would be worse.
Only a small bit, but it is pretty objective.
What are the thoughts.
Just one at a time.
Or none at a time.
Or all of them at once in an email.
No, out of all the people I have met in my life, you are at the top.
Eugh I am so tire.d
You do not have to be useful to other people, you just have to be happy.
These television shows are really getting to you.
Sometimes you just want to rebel and say
> Fuck capital letters
Because you were asking about punctuation.
Is it just about being useful?
Because you are a very useful friend.
You stop me going crazy.
I have spent lots of time by myself and you are always here to stop it.
Toka is at work all the time.
I would be too lonely without you.
And I do not want anyone else to fill your position.
They have palm oil fat and spread here.
Correct.
What do you mean?
AC is just for the mega rich.
And there is no coffee here.
I did.
But I need it **NOW**
Checkout mail.lost.host
Is it nice?
Hi.
Are you finished univerisity yet?
A "meeting" with your "project collegues".
Are you excited for it?
Why are you in the club.
You want different people?
I am home.
Waiting for a video of Mariam.
:(
Or do you want those people kicked in?
> Aall kick youuu in, ya wee badger
I have not had coffee yet today.
Do you feel my pain.
I am hoooooooooome.
Are you fine?
OH MY GOD
WHAT HAVE YOU BECOME
Yeah that thing is quite the beast.
I think it would sell for around 800-1000USD.
It is a bid.
Since it is used, I would not go above 500-600.
And it is old now.
Two generations behind.
Have a look for the parts new to see the cost.
Then see how much other items sell for on ebay.
And you have to trust a random seller.
I mean the person selling it.
You have to trust they are selling it in good condition.
You give your maximum price.
And it will auto bid up to that price.
My dad used to buy a lot of stuff on ebay.
Clothes mainly.
Wake up.
Not really offers though.
Most of it is second hand.
If you are clever about bidding you can get a good deal though.
Wait what?
What is going on?
HEY
Oh, I found the recording I made.
It must be pretty exciting having had a sample of a lost treasure.
NI has like 90 percent of its trade with Ireland, having restrictions on that would be insane.
Also, if NI gets it, there is no way Scotland will not get it.
The DUP are against having a single market?
NI needs to stop being in the UK.
They are Irish, they are on the Ireland island.
At least make it British Overseas Territory, not a country.
Do they even feel like their own country?
Their government is a mess.
We should flip the table, why should scottish people be voting on english matters?
English rule for england!
I would be fine with a federation...
A european federation.
Fuck having another layer of governance.
I was baiting that :D
The DUP are a joke.
How are they even in a colalition with the good friday agreement?
They just fucking bought their support.
I really have no idea.
I could not ping which scared me.
So I tried to log in, sent me an email, I was fucked.
Switched the dns back to the scotland server, set up mail, waiting for the dns to propogate, logged in.
Used the console, server was running fine.
Still could not ping it.
Decided to ping from the server to another frankfurt server, bam, back.
I saw the network graph and it just died at 10pm.
I feel like there was an internal network problem.
But small and unnoticed.
My other franfurt server was fine.
Stressful as shit when it happens.
Did you see the "communities" feature in riot down at the bottom left?
Come in.
Not sure what it even is.
But I would like to seperate my work, family, and friends.
Have more prioritized notifications by group.
Yeah it was.
It was stressful.
I have no explanation either.
Will you listen to it.
I am a little shy for you to.
Can you imagine it was lost forever.
Did you sleep.
It is your day off tomorrow.
I was in bed.
I am awake now.
I really wish I was sleeping more.
Jesus.
All cut?
Do I wait for you to come home to roast them?
How will you spend your day.
Toka prepared roast vegetables for me to roast when I get home.
I am so busy at work :(
I am the foolest ever.
I ate so much fool.
What is it?
Last time I did that was sneak skill in oblivion on the 360.
I tihnk.
Wow.
It launched with micro transactions?
Fuck that.
Going to be working at home today and tomorrow after work.
WIll take the hours off next week.
I have to work at home today and tomorrow after work.
So you have to keep me company and stop me going crazy.
Where did you go.
Okay so you are nice and awake now?
10/10 woke up.
A client without a realistic idea of how much work it takes to get what he wants.
I will take the hours off next week though.
I do not like working extra hours.
Are notifications any better now it is on a new server?
:/
Can she try harder to remember...?
He came and stole our money.
:@
Nope :(
I am the only one capable.
The landlord came and took my pay.
33% of it.
Where is happy Mariam?
Hello.
Lisa has not though.
A lot of work recently.
She logged in.
I think this is a 7/10 happy.
<3
Probably not.
Lisa is sending some money I think.
No idea what to get.
If I had amazon, that would be another story.
I need shoes.
Lisa is going to get the shoes when she gets paid though.
I will just wait until someone visits.
I am patient.
Seeing you will never not make me happy.
It is the visit to toka's parents on my birthday.
Last year they gave me a slice then kept the rest of the cake.
I want the whole cake.
The UK one.
Storing all our money in pounds.
It is more stable.
Them.
We still have a lot in egp too.
Oh it is back.
It happened again.
What the fuck.
I messaged them about it now.
Nothing they have reported.
And I know the droplet is running fine.
It is 100% a network error.
Nope.
I can connect to the wireguard server.
I can connect to all the servers.
And none of them can connect to it.
Inbound only.
When I got into the acount and used the virtual console, it could ping outwards fine.
No firewall.
one.
From lost.host I can ping everything.
From everything I can not ping lost.host
The other droplet tofu.world does not have problems.
Where are you?
It was.
I mailed them about it.
Why are you not feeling so good?
I am going to bed.
I am now cray cray.
Crazy.
What do you want most of all now?
You never said why.
Oh WhatsApp too.
My inner top thighs were a little itchy so I looked at them. The Skin was missing patches. 
Nope.
Are you trying to make me sad?
It was missing and red.
I hope it is just because of chafing while cycling.
But now I am scared of my legs touching.
Why did you argue :(
It is more scary than anything.
But an argument? I spent forever away from you then close but basically still far. It just makes me sad.
But not too sad, I know you are always here and will be always here.
I never argued with toka until we lived together.
But it mostly stopped after a year.
Now it is rare.
I do not know.
I am in bed.
Did you sleep?
Are you making me go to sleep?
I was just about to give up.
There were things I did not like that she did.
Remember the night I was stuck in the room and she had people here.
Things like this.
She got my illness and is slightly snoring now.
Where did you go today?
No.
The breakfast club only has the K.
Do you remember the two photos I sent. One of me eating it and one of Natasha with a box?
Probably.
All the photos are in the matrix chat.
But if I emailed them.
But I think I do somewhere.
You click room details then files.
Oh wow.
We have always been in the **matrix** Mariam.
I am joking about being in a simulation.
Twitter, hangouts, telegram, conversations, matrix.
You missed tox.
The battery is low so if I disappear do not wait for me.
Yeah you get upset at things I say in real life.
If I ever insult you, it is humour.
I would never really insult you.
Why would I.
Like when I call you fat.
Are you as tall as me? That still shocks me to even imagine.
*disclaimer*: Mariam is the best weight and height and she could be any size it would not matter to me.
I will add these to avert worrying.
I will sleep on that heart.
Goodnight mariak.
Be fine. Be not sad or worried.
Be the Special M.
Go where ever the fork flows.
What else.
:)
This face is too short.
Well that explains that.
Good morning.
Are you fine today?
Are you better today?
That is pretty funny.
Of course dicks and boobs, or neither.
Patch her to have a massive schlong.
Did you like the song.
The rain...?
You walked all the way to work?
Just staying at work today.
I think you may be home before me.
HI
qaU?4vt_0,lWLr5])U18>'zK5
I got a crepe.
Yeah and mushroom.
From CREPE ZONE
I still have a crepe.
It is huge.
I am fine, I have the bear jumper.
Nope.
I will keep you up to date though.
d
I think I will leave soon.
PAcking up now.
I am home.
I did 13 hours today.
Are you home and well.
I am falling.
Hello.
You are on a roll saying hello first.
I just woke up.
It is my day off if you have a game proposal.
I think so.
Give me 30 minutes to get breakfast.
* And then disappearing
mail.lost.host is actually pretty snazzy.
If you set the theme to ycombinator and the default mail style to news.
You can add multiple mail accounts too.
I am trying to get rss working on it, that would be great.
Sorry, hacker news.
You do have to manually save your settings when you change them.
No more.
Just a little odd.
2:24
You google account probably needs to enable "insecure" mail clients.
I remember they added something at somepoint that only allowed oauth2.
I could be talking shit though.
Let me try to add a google account.
Oh, did you select tls?
tls is tls only, starttls is not tls here.
Oh, the auto google account option.
cypht
Fails for me too.
I will have a look at it later when I get bore.
I think you need to make sure imap is also enabled in gmail.
Also, I have not set up dkim on the new server yet.
So outbound mail is not have dkim signatures.
does
I will probably do that today.
A little rain yesterday.
We do not even get wind.
Why is it ice cold.
I am so cold.
I have everything on.
Just tried nixos again.
And it worked this time.
It is impressing me so far.
I like that I can set add a firewall by adding the two lines:
And then `nixos-rebuild switch` to rebuild the system.
And the gnupg agent, no more fucking around getting the systemd service to work and adding lines to my bash start up scripts.
No more xinit file to start dwm
There are 5728 options you can stick in the configuration file.
Which makes me wonder how the fuck people maintain those.
When breaking changes happen, it is meant to have safe upgrades because of this layer in between actual configuration.
I managed to install the new operating system I wanted to.
Well new to me; it is 14 years old.
Come in.
Are you coming home yet.
My stomach demands the samboosa sacrafice.
This is well known.
It looks like a joke.
I prefer coins.
They feel so much better.
That is true.
Yeah.
Just have a rectangle be 20gbp, a sphere be 100gbp, a cylinder 5gbp, and a pyramid 10gbp.
Yeah.
Are you and mummy home?
Do you guys want to have a chat with toka?
Yeah.
Well, you can find yout.
You can call her.
Yeah.
I wonder if it has horse physics.
You have to keep in in your stable.
And tame it.
How much do I owe you for the crepe?
Thank you :). Are you working today?
Will I call later tonight?
Daddy asked if I am well and I do not know how to respond.
Not really but we will talk later.
I said we would call later tonight when he is home.
But maybe it would be better if you were there too.
Well it is my birthday and the call will have to happen today.
What was a mistake?
Well clearly it is a mistake.
If it was not a mistake it would be way way worse.
I am thinking about making my own matrix client.
That way I can put voice messages in it.
It has been a while since I made my own android app though.
And I want to try some new things.
Look at all the snow on your car.
Are you fine today.
I am not fine today.
I will speak later though.
Same as before.
Wake up.
Hello.
I have not set up the network drives yet.
Restart my computer,
In the boot menu, go all the way up to arch linux.
Then on your computer in a terminal
`cat /etc/fstab`
Then paste it here.
Hello.
When am I going to start my own app with my own notifications.
She had no excuse.
I am dead inside.
What can I do.
She thought I would not mind because it was a female.
But cheating is cheating.
How am I ever meant to trust her again.
I am here.
What the fuck.
Can you make a snowball?
Yeah.
But without trust, nothing means much.
No.
I want to leave it until tomorrow.
Yeah.
I have been ignoring her today.
As if she was a flatmate.
My birthday.
My mum and sister were very good at telling her she is terrible.
I do not like parties.
I made them speak this morning.
Anything coming from just me would not be enough.
If her parents knew, I have no idea what would happen.
I did sleep.
I have no idea.
I am not happy at all.
Sad.
4:30.
Just keep me posted if you can.
I will get into bed because it is freezing.
But please stay here.
No you guys were good.
I have trouble knowing how to proceed.
I am just sad and devastated.
I am trying to be alone.
She thinks I hate her.
She had to ask me an hour ago.
I hate what she did.
I feel neglected and shat on.
So does everyone.
It would feel like giving up.
It would be too easy for me to not come back.
How can toka prove something like this will not happen again?
How can she prove she knows it is wrong.
It is going to take a long time.
I just try to forget what I gave up.
I used to get really upset thinking about it.
She never thought about me and how it would affect me.
How could she even think it was a choice?
Being drunk is never an excuse.
I told her, while I was drunk many months ago that I would find her sleeping with a woman slightly less worse than a man, because she is straight.
Not that I find either okay.
But now her sister is saying she is Bi.
Which is the first I have heard of.
And if any lines were fuzzy, she could ask before crossing it.
Before we lived together we talked about what turned us on.
And she said sleeping with other people.
I did not like that so I told her it would ruin us.
No.
And when you get married you picked a person.
Shocked and disappointed.
They were good and expressing the bad.
My mum gave her a lecture.
I never really had to say anything, they said it all.
I tried talking to toka first but she could not say anything worth something.
I slept at 7 for a while.
I used to do that but not the screaming part.
How can you wake up screaming.
I have never.
What was the nightmare.
I got up for some water.
Now I am doing Duolingo in the living room.
That game is super old.
How are you playing it.
Mariam. Whyyyyyyyy :-(
Did you leave me to play it.
Are you crazy.
I wish there were photos on here I could send.
Maybe I could mount the computer from the phone.
Just my life.
I never take photos anymore.
I only have the camera.
2.7gib...
It will get stolen.
No I just wish to see you more.
In real life?
I am so glad I got rid of social things.
I can focus on just you and Ben.
Private groups?
Fuck that.
Why are they not sending emails.
Just delete everyone and all your history and change your photo to blank.
I think it lets you download all your data.
It should because EU law.
I just filtered all of toka's friends from my life.
I do not know.
There are so many too.
Will you send you.
Me neither.
You do not know what you want.
Just to be useful.
Would your parents mind?
Nope you need to eat, drink and sleep.
Everything else is conditional.
**eat, drink, sleep, and meet me more.
My breathing is going bad.
Too much cat.
It sleeps with us.
Under the blanket next to us.
It is impossible to lock it out. It just keeps me awake if I do.
It will scratch the door or sniff my ears.
I have medicine.
Mariam. Why do I not know about you?
I know everything?
I think because I talk to you a lot and for a long time I assume you know everything.
But I think there will be large gaps missing that I am not aware of.
I will go back to bed.
But stay.
Mariam.
Morning.
I am on autopilot.
Me too.
I am home.
Come in.
I am quite hungry.
I have cake, samboosa, and peanut butter.
No, she gets home at 9-10.
She was a terrible person.
If she never regret it I would not be here.
Why express it publicly though.
My dad sends the whole of facebook a happy birthday paul message on my birthday.
Like my birthday is some kind of social point grab.
I think my mum does not.
She is not a psycho.
Why?
Who can she expect to support me?
I had some cake.
Are you home yet?
Finally persuing your dreams.
No sleep, no nightmares. This all makes sense. You need the beauty saloon because you missed your beauty sleep.
What will happen at the saloon.
I think you changed your eyebrows recently.
Yeah I just checked, they look the same.
Someone must have changed their eyebrows.
Cake.
Cake for all the meals.
Are you browed up yet?
I have only had two lots.
Yeah.
It is good.
Without
Without showing me...?!
Did you tell daddy you would go around?
I am too tired.
I am so tired.
And cold.
Thank you :D
I switched to nixos last weekend.
I am really liking it so far.
I just have cake.
Very different.
You give it a configuration input.
And it generates a system.
It is a functional package manager.
So the same input always produces the same output.
Nah.
Not yet at least.
I have a lot of experience with arch.
You should read the documentation before saying you will give it a try :D
A video may be better.
duolingo.com
Nah, take a pick.
Should be pretty easy for you.
Are you home.
Why though.
Just wait.
A demo can still manipulate.
No why.
Did they take your eyebrows off.
Oh.
I was going to say.
Also they can not give copies to reviewers they do not like.
I would wait until post launch.
They are dynamically generated based on words you need to practice.
Memrise has real recordings.
But I find it much worse.
You can turn of audio questions if you do not like them.
That is the one I used.
I think the switch justifies getting now.
Odyssey looks like pure joy.
Yeah.
You did not go to daddy's did you?
Do not go.
I am fine.
I just need to talk about something.
But I am not ready yet.
Do not worry.
Okay I told him I was not ready and to not worry.
I am here.
Why are you having so many nightmares.
That does not seem normal.
She stops you?
Tell her you will walk.
And you will take a torch.
Hello.
Morning.
My stomach is so bad.
And my poo is rampant.
I am on the end of a cold though.
Maybe it is just when we talk.
The pollution is really bad here.
They burn rubbish outside magdsoft a lot.
No my stomach is dying.
Nah I have a toilet here.
Nah I only like food straight off the cooker.
-7 in my hands.
Wake up.
To type with...
Hey.
Yeah he mentioned that.
Going to come home.
Not really.
:D
Just finishing a bit of code.
I think so.
I am not concerned she will cheat again.
I am more concerned about my legal status here.
I do not have a work visa or resident permit.
And the only time they will check is at the airport.
I think I can get them.
But I have not done it yet.
And there will be a fine probably
The work and resident permit.
If me and toka are fine at the end of the year, do you want to come to south korea with us?
I am going home.
I am too sore.
I am home.
I am sorry I never said good night last night.
You have not came out at all.
Toka just went to work.
Last night I saw the wall tap that we never use was dripping.
So I tried to shut it and it just snapped off.
Water was gushing everywhere
It got fixed today.
I was not here.
But just sticking a new tap on the end.
My stomach is so bad.
It feels like I had knives for dinner.
When?
We had a tap before.
I think I am not getting notifications.
Yeah, I enabled them.
I had pea soup.
But my stomach has been dying since last night.
I think I need a giant hot chocolate.
I will look into it.
Get her a self driving car.
Okay.
I took a very long shower.
It is the beginning of MxMxPxx.
I have some of these but they are not great.
I am fine at work.
And back here I just need to wear my underclothes.
Already had soup.
Making hot chocolate now.
Mariam mariam.
What did you do?
Every night I want to get extra sleep.
And some how I never do.
It seems due now.
Can you imagine it ships with micro transactions.
Or it is build from the ground up for paid mods.
Can you be great?
That is why I said it.
I do not mind if you cry, just that you are sad.
What will be?
When will you be home.
I am super sleepy.
Oh I thought it was 9.
I had noodles :(
Food in the usa seems really expensive in general though.
At least gary gave me that impression.
When we used to compare prices, his was way more expensive.
Food is cheap as chips where I am.
50% inflation rate on food :D
For domestic food or import though.
I imagine import is slightly higher.
But us labour costs are lower than the UK.
I imagine the UK has pretty cheap imports because they ruled so many important trade locations in the past.
Also, the free trade zone in europe.
The amount of labour required to get food to you in a restaurant, for 2gbp.
How cheap or efficient are they.
Clothes are all import though.
And they are cheap as fuck.
Any clothes not cheap as fuck are priced wrong.
Or domestic.
Tips :D
I tell people off for even suggesting to leave a tip.
I get really angry.
It is like a pay what you want for labour.
Because their employer is barely paying them.
It tricks people into thinking the product is priced lower than its value, and it forces staff to kiss ass.
No.
Countdowning.
It is not just the US though.
I think many many countries.
I can search, hold on.
Quebec provides alternate minimum wage schedule for all tipped employees.
For example, laws in Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Guam specify that employees must be paid the full minimum wage of that state/territory (which is equal or higher than the federal minimum wage in these instances) before tips are considered
It is often easy to forget states vary a lot.
Guam has been a state since this feburary.
Just joshing with you.
Why will it be better?
Do I not make it better?
Where is video mariam?
video as an adjective.
Not yet.
But going to bed.
If I am not asleep in 20 minutes I will be here.
If you get 100 days, you get 10 lingots.
Hi.
I slept 12 hours.
I am commited to spanish right now.
Same here.
My sister sent me a video of lossie in snow.
I am on a 2 day streak.
Tell me to wake up.
We did once.
Mariam.
Cold.
Most things.
I need more coffffeee.
3 day streak.
Killing it.
110 days you get 11 lingots.
So eventually you can buy a skip every week.
I get pissed when people open the windows when we have the meshes there.
They open the wrong side, or the mesh too.
I am getting hungry again.
I had fool and cake.
Samboosa, that is it.
Only a few times.
What is wrong?
Sewage?
Or flies?
Best to get the drains cleaned, and then keep the plugs in when not in use
You can put a piece of cellotape over each drain and check in the morning.
It will show you which drain they are coming from.
Before you go to bed, cover the drain with clear cellotape, in the morning you will find flies stuck to the tape from the drain they bread in.
I would say it is the shower one, because they love to lay eggs in hair.
Yeah sure.
It is all savings anyway.
Computer shopping is once ever 2-3 years.
Where are you.
But today you had university.
I am here.
This is the period where you get to decide when I fall.
It is like a mission of crazy taxi.
One where if you stop driving or slow down to much a bomb blows up the car.
But instead I fall asleep.
Too
Why only an hour or two.
I think you need more practice playing crazy taxi.
What are you doing?
I took a taxi home because I wanted to be home.
Good morning.
Yeah this is good.
The offer is not signed, so could have been rejected.
I had the bitengen.
Hurry hurry for the nooooodles.
Thank you.
Can you send the original photo?
I have the document.
I do want to though.
Tonight.
If you accompany me.
I have to do productive things.
Instead of watching videos 24/7.
It is almost home time.
I am going home.
It is your day off.
I am home.
Yes.
How long do you have?
Hanging out is **productive**.
Where did you go.
I really hate fy.
So much so I would say no to fy.
Did you explode.
Do I have cake or noodles.
Whe're the students well behavoured?
There is only one noodle though.
What is the average age?
I am here.
Wire it through.
My pockets are ready.
Wire transfer.
It is what they use in bank heist movies.
Yeah, I am joking.
That is the only mistake you noticed?
You'shdve notised.
Amn't.
I have cake.
Well if you say that I would be tempted to get an nintendo switch.
But I will save it for a holiday next year.
300 but I will wait a year or two until it is cheap and hacked so I can just download games.
I will check in a bit.
Cake.
I am not letting a cake go mouldy.
I am so worried these days that it is just you not getting notifications.
Like you are sitting there waiting for me to respond to your invite.
You never got poppy spayed did you?
We need to get our cat spayed.
It is really annoying with its meowing.
And walking round with its ass in the air.
The male already had a vesectomy.
The male cost 10gbp I think, the female 40gbp.
But then I would trust uk vets a lot more.
A week of work wage wise.
I can not deal with her in heat though.
I need cats that lay on the couch all day.
Crazy eyes is calm these days.
Much better behavioured after the operation.
Our cats sleep under the blankets all day long.
So it must be pretty cold here.
I think it is time for a shower.
We got it fixed and now the temperature and water pressure is great.
You must have slept.
I started writing Lostly.
Riot watch out.
Wait. Did you get it when I sent from the phone...
Or did you just come here.
Almost.
Pizza maybe.
How was your day off.
I am.
Nah.
But pizza is just way better.
We can heat up the remaining when you get home.
Oh not yet.
Remind me tonight.
Oh someone is looking pretty.
Oh I am at work right now.
I am not actually watching them yet.
When I get home.
It is not wednesday until people are home.
Oh you are here.
I feel like you have popped out of existence.
It is weeeeeeeekend time.
The good old PPx.
I have mini pretzels.
I can wait until you are home.
I have pretzels and fool.
The cats are ruining my sleep and sleep is ruining my day.
Enough ruin.
I had a shower.
Did you eat?
Do you want to?
Are you crying?
You are just sitting and saying no.
And then cry?
Are you going to walk to me?
I am struggling to stop eating the pretzels.
Okay you can drive.
Okay you can crawl.
Do you feel better?
Why can you not sleep?
I feel like I am talking to someone who does not want me to.
Okay.
Everything is short and negative.
What are the thoughts.
You mean so much to me it hurts when you belittle yourself.
I hope you are happy soon.
I should get some coffee.
Things are going back to normal but I occasional remember and it feels like my veins are rotting away.
**SEND THEM FASTER**
Oh SuperHighResolutionMariam.
I like how your face gets morphed more in the reflections.
Okay now I have my fingers crossed for a MegaResolution picture.
Currently?
Or in the past?
**New server, new rules**
Resend everything.
You can have a heart for every picture <3
*incoming*
Come back.
Does it not play on the phone?
I recorded with the volume too low.
Hey no complaints.
It is common with females everywhere.
I just noticed that if I keep blending something seperates.
And it starts to turn white.
And it confused me.
I am tempted to just stick my hand in the cup of coffee.
Are you happy yet.
Right, of course.
It is the council, I imagine it is okay.
Not much I would not sign for that salary.
My first day they had a party.
The only party since I joined.
At the end of this month, I will be the second longest lasting person there.
I am so sleepy.
What can you do?
Oh no.
What enjoyable things can you do?
Are you excited for **Christmas**?
Sleep.
A bit.
I had fool 3 hours ago.
I could have 2-3 slices and keep the rest for the morning.
What do you want?
Well I will be more hungry by then.
Always.
Also bananas.
But .75kg.
Hmmmm.
My appetite is a bit dogey right now.
Orange juice and soap.
Iffy.
Bananas then.
And 1 pear.
Or a pineapple.
Or a coconut.
Or a nectarine.
ship all the food.
Max imports, max profits.
Shipping routes hitting the roof since suez version 2.
Kickstarter for suez 3.
Frnm
From where?
What is this?
Half the party was pro eu, right?
Indepence will be then name of the new scottish pence peice.
Back when the leave/stay vote happened, I think half the party wanted to stay.
But now they have to follow party line.
And dictator corbyn will stab you if you want to stay now.
They are trying to win the popularity contest.
Disolve the parliment, let the lords decide.
You will become a hikikomori.
Well yeah, but I feel like you have to be in Japan to really be one.
Yeah, just checked, it is in.
Thank you.
I has never gone wrong before.
Some of them are funny.
Seen much funnier constructs on r/programmerhumor though.
Jokes of course.
Are you here.
Good morning.
I finally managed to display some message from this room in the app.
Normall that would be easy.
But I did it in a special way.
I need coffee.
Hmmm.
Like this.
How are you today?
This pretty much.
I hate it.
Is it google being greedy fucks?
Or is it the site getting paid to offload some of google's work to its visiters, and them being greedy fucks.
Sometimes I have to answer 20 fucking questions.
And what makes it worse, is I know nocaptcha exists where no questions are needed.
But never once fucking saw it.
Nah, they lie.
I can answer one of the questions correctly, without a doubt.
And it will just give me 10 more.
I think it depends on you ip a lot.
And if you are on tor, forget about getting past it.
I miss the days of reading text.
Or writing numbers.
I think the amount of data they have they do not need to train it any more.
It should be about checking whether I am a bot or not.
Not about working.
How are there not popular alternatives to google's captcha?
Everyone hates it.
Are you at university?
My nose is cold and keeps leaking.
What do you want to do today?
Mega test
My hands are -1 all day.
Okay.
Oh this is early.
Make it when you leave.
Okay.
Oh no I am very hungry.
Tester yo
bigger test
Tho
The pizza is going frozen.
It was when I sent a message from the phone.
Satnav.
Midrange starts at about 200gbp.
The lowest of the low is 40gbp.
Not sure why google maps, her phone, and a dock with charger are not way better.
The basic ones seem to start at 80gbp.
Anything below that is some unheard of toy.
Also not sure how it is going to be useful enough for her.
I did a lot of Lostly today.
I managed to get super super smooth loading of message history as you scroll.
And room, a list of rooms, with some names and avatars.
It is not near ready.
But do you want to try it?
This is a long nap.
Hi.
I had to get out of bed to turn the speakers off.
Yeah.
Yes.
I think riot android sends firebase notifications.
And riot web does not.
But then I thought it was matrix that sent them, not riot.
I do not know.
Just always be here.
I am very sleepy.
I was just falling as the sound happened.
I still find it weird that the cats sleep with us under the blanket.
I never slept with my parents.
That is weird.
I was never a baby.
I was born a man.
Who are you calling a baby?
What did toddler Mariam look like?
I think I have never seen.
I really want to see if you looked similar.
Waiting.
It does not load full size on the phone.
But I think I have no idea how that person became you.
I will look closer in the morning.
But I think I will need missing puzzle pieces to see the transformation.
Okay I am burning up under the cover.
I will sleep.
Goodnight Mariam.
Be awake when I wake.
K mariak.
Stupid phone.
Good morning.
Nope this does not look like you.
On trains.
Did you try Lostly?
The internet is slow today.
This video reminded me of you and hla.
Come in.
Iiiiiiiiiiiiit'sssssssssssss **Mariam**
I am as cold as ice.
Because ice is the coldest thing I can think of.
Today was not an off day for you.
What.
MxMxPPx
You are off sunday and tuesday.
What.
MxMxPPM?
No wait.
This changes everything.
MxMxPBx
It is the only way I can remember.
Max max PBX
Whatever that means.
Here is a second version of Lostly.
Am I the only person you have on riot?
Nada is in my bad books.
She is dating and friends with people who I no longer trust to respect a marriage.
I currently hate every single one of toka's friends.
And nada was told by the perpetrator the morning after.
Which puts her closer to toka's friends than to me.
Did I scare you away.
It is spam.
You do not have an account, a bitcoin wallet, or anything.
You should be concerned with how they know your name.
Just had some lentil soup.
It was the thickest soup I have had.
I had to take bites from it.
What did you have?
No I am here.
It is too late to study.
I came up with a name for a competting robinsons orange drink.
Yallabina.
Like yellowbina like ribena.
It should be spelt Yallabena though.
Why.
Oh no.
How bad is it on a scale?
Is it not your choice who you talk to about your feelings?
What kind bad is it?
Is it disappointment or fallout or something.
Is it someone's fault?
Did you tell him to lay it down straight with her.
And convince you sufficiently so that you should not worry.
I have not told toka about anyone who had feelings for me.
I am worried about you though. I do not like it when you are sad.
Those people's feelings are not my doings and she should not need to worry about them.
I only talk about things I choose.
If I do something bad I admit it.
But if something bad happens to me, I usually hide it.
I would tell her if I had bad thoughts about it.
I have done.
I have seen the happy Mariam and Hazeem, I ain't worried.
I will probably be working.
Probably yeah.
It is a monday.
Are you fine?
You said your heart was crushed.
How can I not worry.
Just received an email that looks like feedly sold my email address.
So I deleted it and got news.lost.host
It is quite nice.
Do you use rss?
Morning.
new.lost.host :D
paul `Toekabee`
Works for me in the android emulator.
But it is for proper computers.
I got an email from either feedly, or feedly selling my email address to someone.
So I deleted it.
Do you have a summary?
The internet at work it terrible.
A real car?
What game are you talking about?
Oh.
mgsv
Okay so no food tonight.
How long will it take?
Will you not be at work?
You should phone and ask.
Because at 900 I expect it takes a long time.
Wake up.
Hi.
It is your day off today.
No tomorrow.
Okay be home.
Are you any better?
The pretzels are finished :/
:(
Jesus the prolape is expensive.
Yeah you do not want to hear or see it.
At what time?
She just prolapsed.
Really fucking far.
To pick up.
Our female cat is going for two operations tomorrow.
Spaying and stitching in the asshole so it does not prolapse.
It is costing 2000egp.
Yeah.
Realm is very good.
What is it?
Have you seen Black Mirror yet?
3?
What is dark?
I am watching the walking dead.
I am one episode behind.
Not fed.
What should I have?
I had cake.
I think I will have fool.
And me.....?
It is the foundations of OO.
But it should be applied with moderation.
It can go to extremes.
But a healthy amount is good.
From what I have used it with.
The principles I go by are the Go ones :D
Simplicity and orthagonality
Python is weird and slow.
Indentation being a part of the language is enough to stop me proceeding any further.
Also it is scripting.
Only with pypy.
Which is the least stable software written.
If you are looking at a new language, go/rust.
We have to.
Why?
Because he was under anesthetic.
The vet is the expert.
Our cat is having two operations tomorrow and it costs 2000egp.
This is half a months work :/
Not yet.
One to prevent prolapses, and one to prevent heat and pregnancy.
I just want her to stop covering everything in the house with blood, and to be quiet.
Hi Mariam.
I am super hungry.
I am glad you are here.
It is not pure breed.
Breeding is cruel.
But I have no idea what breed it is closest to.
It is just a cat.
That is creepy.
Is that not a bit of a step down from a developer?
I know what they do because I worked in a factory.
I think doing what you like is way more important than a higher pay.
As long as the pay hits your base line minimum.
Will you send you.
If you can work to get money *and* have enough free time to do what you like, sure.
But programming and typing are my hobbies.
So I feel very comfortable.
5k is barely a lot.
I think you could get that if you looked around.
If I never enjoyed myself outside of work, I would hate the monotomy too.
My key is making as much of my time not work.
:D
You hate seeing me everyday, got it.
I am too scared to leave.
I will never.
Until I leave Egypt.
I get free breakfast and coffee.
Of having a job I feel less happy in.
The risk is scary.
Who is not making what step to stop what?
One line adapters :D
That is the ItemViewBinder interface, it is for defining viewtypes and how to create/bind the view holder.
Because I implement it multiple times.
All my adapters are like this.
That is the last key to the thing here.
Jeez.
It fills the adapter automatically from the database, which requests more data from the network as it reaches the boundaries.
The Repository and BoundryCallback is important, but too big.
The UI is done with anko too, so no xml.
It is a framework by the kotlin team to make android layouts with kotlin DSL.
Looks like that.
Anko layouts, yeah.
No constraint layout though :/
There is a library to add it.
But I would rather wait for an official implementation.
I have fool.
What do you have?
Oh that sounds amazing.
It sounds like a wealth indicator.
Our cat is having two operations tomorrow.
For 2000egp.
And this means I am poor this month.
Spaying so she stops having reproductive behaviour, and never has kittens, and an operation so she stops prolapsing.
Because getting rid of them is irresponsible.
Crazy eyes is almost perfect now.
It is just ginger with her bleeding as and desire to mate.
TAYEB
Allows you to get strings from an intent like: `intent["room"]`
I can not feel my fingers.
300.
Mario oddysey looks amazing.
And I want xenoblade chronicles 2.
One?
To share?
Either you will have it 99% of the time or I will.
I am falling.
I just just woke up and you were in my dream.
You came to work with me.
But there was this weird business meeting.
And you sat in the middle on the couch with your feet up.
After the meeting was finished we all got to work.
And the boss showed you the door.
I ran down the stairs to catch you.
And we hugged.
Nada was there with you.
And she was asking if you were sure you wanted to hug so much because it might make it less special.
And you said no, but continued anyway.
Hey. I miss you too, and christmas a little.
It is something toka did, but I do not feel like going over it again yet.
Something to do with them pushing a promotion.
They always fuck up like that.
Pocket, hello, etc.
The front page has questionable content
But I have my homepage set to blank.
It was just now, and I remember the expressions so clearly.
You laughed and smiled as you said no.
Okay coffee time.
I never remember my dreams these days.
What did you have to do?
Why not.
(
Do you have sleeping pills?
Age gives me a headache when I wake up.
And coffee.
But I noticed even without coffee I still feel awful.
My sister used to take them when she could not sleep.
Maybe there is a different kind you can try.
Why is it so cold.
I just read what happened.
It was disabled by default.
The only way for a user to see the addons effects was an about:config flag.
Still shit though.
That is what the dining room is for.
I am at work.
Morrrring.
Poopy.
THe cat is having two expensive operations today :(
Okay.
Prolapsed every day and spaying.
It is too expensive :/
a
Mariam.
We do not have a cat box.
Did you not ask them to clarify what the requirements of a box are?
Why do they want a box? To stop the cat moving?
Well that alone is going to make carrying easy.
If you want, you can change the internet when you can.
The static ip, and business is no longer needed.
Do you want to call and see how she is doing?
I can not suppose they have much other work than ginger today.
Yeah.
I moved it all to a different server.
Two weeks ago I think.
And it has been working well.
If things go wrong, I can manage them like this.
3.5gbp a month I am paying for the server and everything.
Which is less than even the static ip address cost.
Okay.
We never built back up I think.
I am home.
Oh god.
Naughtly how?
Did they say how it went?
Both precedures?
Okay I will go in a few minutes.
Walk.
Mmm.
What?
1km.
It is far when you cycle it at first.
Okay leaving.
What?
Yes.
I am back.
She is barely concious but has her full attention on getting the collar off.
She has a full week of injections and cream.
I do not know.
The cat just got home.
Yeah.
She needs a box.
I mean a box to stop her moving.
She falls.
No like a prison.
She can not rest on my lap without falling.
I can not use the computer.
She needs attention until she is concious.
I will put something on to watch and keep her on my lap.
The instructions are complicated.
The cat is home.
It is barely concious.
And is struggling to get the neck cone off.
We have to give her so many injections this next week.
Hi.
*incoming*
Go steal them.
Go to the kitchen drawer and take out 3 of your sharpest knives, then offer to trade with he
I want to eat.
But she fell asleep on me.
And I have no idea what to eat.
Yeah.
Bit hard to type.
She has 4 injections a day for a week.
She is sleeping on me now.
But when she semi wakes up she struggles to get the neck cone off.
But she is half concious and will fall off.
No idea, antibiotics probably.
She has stitches in her stomach.
Yeah :S
I just got peed on :(
Will you listen to the message now.
She is sleeping all the time.
I hope she does not pee the bed but also not fall off the bed.
Yeah, the wound.
She is being a handful.
I got peed on again.
Did you like the voice message.
I just had to give an injection for the first time :(
<3
It has she for female, it/they for neutral, and he for male.
Hello.
Pretty exhausted.
How are you?
Wake up.
Work and my cat.
And everything.
It had two operations yesterday.
And it cost half my salary.
And now she is keeping me awake and I have to inject her 3 times a day.
Two.
Sex is not unique to humans...
She got spayed and another operation to prevent her prolapsing.
English does not have special pronouns for humans.
It is mostly used for non-animals.
They is used when you do not know or do not want to say the sex.
It is not too bad these days.
Still working on Qabi :D
Cargo.
Nah, went back to just android and server stuff.
gitlab.com/meutraa/lostly
Something I am working on right now using that stuff.
Though, I pushed some changes this moring that were not ready.
I am not a fan of rxjava.
I did try it.
Maybe I should have another look.
I am a big fan of kotlin though.
I mean I hate it as a language.
But it is miles better than java.
I saw Agera too, but there were a lot of critisisms.
It was part of the google music app team or something.
Dagger2 is pretty fantastic.
Room is also great.
And the paging library.
I took her collar off under supervision.
She just tried to pee or something.
Well still is.
But nothing is happening.
Have not seen her eat or drink yet.
I think I need to buy some cycling boxers and bottoms urgently.
I saw my balls this morning.
And when I got to work it was like my groin was getting sawed in half.
Also the word for spaying is ovariohysterectomy.
Oh wow, they remove from the ovraies to the uterus.
We are going to have two nice cats though.
**with breathing problems
Where are you.
I said why I was not speaking yet.
I want my feelings to go away before I speak about it again.
I hope it will be easier when I have accepted it.
I noticed.
Was my recording that boring.
Sleep and eat and drink.
I try.
Have I not made you better?
Are they mad with you?
How are you ill?
How can it be that late.
My sister got an implant in her arm, along with every female at around 12-13.
And it lasts 5 years.
It stops the periods and prevents pregnancy.
Will you stay up all night now?
That is her brother.
She still has not ate or drank.
She is just sleeping.
D.J Crazy Eyes.
Just warn me when you take the sleeping pill.
He sits there because the computer is hot.
Injection time :(
Me.
Well that was horrible.
She is not eating or drinking.
Did you sleep already.
Nah that is huge compared to mummy's.
Is the new place fully christmafied now?
My christmas might be working.
I may ask for the day off, but there would be nothing to do.
You caught be on the way to be though.
I hope you are fine.
I love you.
I hope you get better.
I fell.
Did you manage to sleep?
Ginger ate and drank for  the first time since the operation.
I am at work.
On thursday then.
Also, the timing is important.
I do not want toka to be there.
She gets home between 6 and 11pm.
Is he working too?
Good morning.
She ate and drank today for the first time since the operation.
It was a relief.
Her stomach looked like a vacuum.
How are you?
What is wrong?
Uh oh.
Some one close to you broke?
I never have fall outs with Ben or Mariam.
What happened?
Does he upset you often?
I find it hard to believe someone would forget something that makes their friend angry.
Well from what I know, fuck him.
You miss the person who never made you angry.
But this person changed and now makes you angry.
The person you miss does not exist anymore.
Same as I think of any laptop, it will overheat and break too quickly.
Thinkpads are usually the best laptops though.
The processor is 4 generations old.
And it is no longer sold.
I would wait for the 8th generation cores.
I have a 4th and a 7th right now.
Of the same model.
And the 7th is about double the performance.
If it is for development, 12GiB of ram is a minimum I think.
16GiB I recommend.
And for speed, mostly look at the storage.
ssd covers the range from shit to balls insane.
CHeck the benchmarks of the ssd.
Hdds are hdds, they are all slow as shit.
But they are good for movies and large storage stuff that you do not care much about.
Never heard of that graphics card.
Sleeping pills :D
How are you?
I am quite okay.
I miss your voice mariam.
Oh yes I forgot to message when I got back.
MY stomach hurts.
The pain went away an hour later.
Everything else is done.
I had the rest of the fool.
Okay fine.
If we order, we should have 2 fool, 1 salad, 1 bitengen, 1 ta3meya, one onion.
Oh wow.
I can probably get it from here if you tell me the file name.
That is for elgin.
Do you have a scanner?
These are all the attachments minus the ones you will scan.
Hello,This is Paul Meredith, replying to the request for additional information for the application by my wife Toka Abdelkader with reference number 25595852.My wife wishes to continue with the application and attached are therequested supporting documentation.Paul Meredith,24th March 2018
Tonight?
He is fine.
Are you home.
I will have all the hummous when I get home.
I am home.
But it is fine.
But only rarely.
Hmm.
Ah a photo here.
Nah the photo is fine.
I need proof of my last job termination.
Today is your family day but if you can call at any time, do it.
Did you send me a voice note on delta?
Toka has just three things to scan and then it will be sent.
Hold on.
They received it.
From a year and a half ago.
Or maybe this.
Oh wow.
Yeah, just getting dressed.
Kind of looks and tastes a little not fresh.
It is in between.
But again, fine.
I might nap now.
Oh wow that was not long.
I hope it goes away quickly.
It is no problem.
I think the first is fine, never mind.
Yeah.
Right I need to wait until my mum is home to get a employment termination document from home.
Come back.
Hi.
Yes, but I will restart to get sound.
I can not wait to sleep all all morning.
I did.
Just breakfast in the morning and hummous when I got home.
This will not happen.
The final deadline is the 26th, so we can verify everything tonight, and scan everything tomorrow and send tomorrow, the 24th.
Any idea where I would have a p60 or whatever it is.
Or take a more straight on photo of it.
That is fine.
But they asked for a load of documentation.
Can you read that over?
There was not much.
No idea because mummy opens it.
:thum
Did you remember internet money?
Wait no that is a tiny resolution.
Oh interesting.
Set an alarm for your medicine.
Windows has zip support it is fine.
Wake up.
Are you here.
Hi.
Still good for today?
One second.
But I am not sure what constitute it.
Did you send the  bank statement here on riot or email?
What is wrong.
The irish visa.
Wake up wake up wake up.
Remember to look, today should be the last day I have to replay.
No.
Can daddy still not log in?
Right, it is sent.
Yeah mummy found it.
He is not answering. 
Is mummy at home?
It was not great cold though.
Yeah I know.
When are you home?
Yeah, do you have a scanner?
This is the wrong p45.
That is when I left for the winter in Elgin walkers.
No it is fine.
Did you scan the other ones?
I am almost going home.
You can send from your email, then send me the documents and I will send from paul@lost.host too.
Hi.
Did you hear the messages.
Back to one hour change.
Oh yeah.
Or wait until you are over there.
Rude.
They should have issued the visa 18 months ago without contacting us about anything.
I left a two weeks after leaving.
Mummy can you look out a document that proves my last employment?
Yeah.
The p45 is the correct document.
Check the hard drive.
Thank you.
Is the rar just all the same files?
Shall I call him on toka's facebook?
It is my dad's birthday.
17 attachements :/
I do not know, it is a punk band.
They are ordering pizza but I will not risk it.
Are we meeting.
I am.
I was here at 3 past.
I am here.
When are you home.
What are you doing?
I am very glad you are here.
They do not need anything, they are stepping beyond their rights.
Hi again.
Remember to send you.
You can send a similar email but with, my husband has sent an email this address with the documentation, but I send the documentation and email here too to answer as a true reply.
Dear Customer,Thank you for your email.It may take a little time to reply due to the large number of queries we receive every day. However, we will do our best to respond as soon as possible. 
Ewww internships.
Good morning.
Anyone that can make me angry.
Otherwise the complexity will become too much to take in.
No one is voting today :D
Yeah.
Or were the fragments inside it zero height?
Good morning.
Wake up wake up.
I called my dad on your facebook because it is his birthday.
Yeah.
Yalle listen etny.
Hmmm.
I can not hear the last two messages because the background noise is so much louder than you.
I am craving the noodle feast.
I was playing a game
Going to have to try that.
I am really excited to play minecraft..................
I just started the modded version today.
Are you out already?
Okay I am here.
Some system at work went down and I had to finish an email about the irish visa.
Yeah, I sent the email.
Yeah, I sent them not archived.
Baaaby.
I could set up email here but I have not yet.
I actually have no clue.
But now I am doing nothing.
Wear earplugs then put the headphones on top.
But if you want to use a terminal to get the password.
Ewww random people.
How is A.Y.A?
This is now how her name is stylized. 
Sure.
Come back.
:D
I am just cracking open the hummous.
I took the washing out too.
I am still hungry.
If you want to understand anything, you would have to start at the beginning with me.
Jeez that is freezing.
Hi.
Still playing minecraft.
Brand new editor-based REST client
Like a karate chop.
:(
I am going home very soon.
I am fine.
But are you fed.
You can `gopass find facebook` then `gopass facebook/matrx_love2007@yahoo.com`
I am playing minecraft with toka.
It is so orange.
Oh hold on.
A long long time ago.
9 is not hot for there.
I saved some in a jar for you.
Go for tuesday, I am too tired today.
Did you lock the hummous jars.
No.
Yeah.
28 here.
I was home at 3.
I am here too.
What will you do today?
How was the therapist?
Actually now.
Unless the size never changes.
Why?
2literal4me
No.
But do not worry about it.
We often go periods without talking.
I will take a shower.
Hi.
I said before, it is only working when the focus is firefox.
Wow stop having these dreams.
I am making toast for hummous.
Be fine.
Hello again.
I can only see delta at home.
What.
I had some dates too.
Oh god I am sweaty.
Oh wow this bread makes the best looking toast ever.
Or plug it in to your computer and I will find it.
I think I need coffee.
Have. to. minecraft.
My farts smell reaaally weird.
I have never smelt anything like this in my life before.
Lists are just better than arrays though.
I am literally going to crack it open soon.
An uber loud car.
Good find :)
But a bit.
I find the sound of the music is better.
Coming home.
You showered the dishes.
I will go to bed.
Room query autocomplete :D
I am hoooooooome.
Hummoumoummoums.
I had the habenero sauce and a few crushed cashews.
Did we not check that by using a constraint layout?
Do not dream badly.
I have no sound.
The hard drive has the backup of the documents.
In files, check other filesystems, then hmmm backups, then toka.
Uncooked, right?
Where are you.
No, just been playing games.
Thunder here.
Not yet.
"anywhere in the world" **** that has 3d building data.
It was hummous.
What can I say.
Toka is going out.
I mean anyone can register, it is public, but sure.
We will probably see if we can get a week off.
It is **R A M S E S E   B** day.
Oh.
Where are you.
How many lamps does she need?
56 flavours in total.
<3
I stopped drinking alcohol since my birthday.
The hdd.
What happened?
The official spelling.
I made carrot, pea and kosa stirfry with cashews and habenero sauce.
Hello.
I have not had it yet.
I had it.
I will talk to toka tonight.
Do you not wave them down?
I am still at work.
I am gooooiiing home.
I am home.
I am tired.
What will you buy?
Hurry home.
I am fine.
I am curious how she makes you feel so okay.
Yeah she spilled the beans yesterday.
Yeah, there was, but we were sleeping
I have hiccups that will not stop.
I mean the fart.
Me being savage hahaha.
My head hurts, I need some coffee.
How did she fix you so well.
I will go to bed.
I have headphones.
Wrong chat.
I finally opened the jar of hummous.
I have a long work day tomorrow :/
Our off days do not align up.
It is lisa, she keeps leaving nasty messages then deleting them.
Yeah.
Did you propose to her?
Goodnight Mariak.
I took my headphones with me today.
**WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON**
I am very happy you are fine and relaxed.
Honestly I think it is savage and rude.
Oh and amr.
It stinks of dust.
And the house is dust.
Are you home.
It is too hard to do on linux.
Yeah it is.
Let me check.
No I am eating.
I am still at work.
There was only green tea.
Yeah, do not leave.
We can talk friday.
Okay, I will give it an hour or so to go through first.
The windows were open..
What will you do?
But no vets.
Thursday is parents day this week.
Okay.
It this a continuous show now?
I am super super hungry.
Hoooooooome time.
And the air smells like dust.
Workers are not entitled any holiday days until after the first six months in Egypt.
When was the last time you had a raise?
Then why bother with all that?
But have a look for a router spoofing application for android.
Not on the play store, because it is a malicious tool.
It would also intercept requests to upgrade to https and force a downgrade to http.
I am too.
In exchange for 100gbp.
Good morning.
Wake up.
Nothing.y
It is a nothing day.
Friday I think nothing.
What do you want in the salad.
Or bananas, almonds, and spinach.
And hungry.
Are you home yet.
And rain.
The fog of uncertainty.
He told me nothing about holiday days.
Yeah, he never agreed that with anyone.
You had a permanent contract from day one.
QC jeez.
Too much work stuff for today.
Did you pay the internet?
There used to be an android app to do it.
Oh wow I completely forgot.
But yeah, come over.
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDlhc41SY2s87odP1kN8AvXtSAHGDlU3OasMgX/z2kIy kareem@polygon
Oh kareem came over.
Come over on friday.
Will you have a berry salad or a leaf salad.
Yeah, I just got home.
But also, employers do not have to pay for unused holiday days either.
Actually, I forgot to do the evaluations today.
If we find this app, use it but lower the speed by like 15KiB/s a day.
You are on your way?
Having some hummous.
There is none.
Yeah, not much going on.
The hobo does not propose ordering.
It smells of dust.
She just denied it until we showed evidence.
No, you have to impersonate the router.
Are you fine?
Okay.
How long will you be?
I am too.
I offered your cheese.
Have banana, apple, and peach salad.
I wish I had a salad making machine.
They never ordered.
I will die.
The bathroom was brown.
I think you would be due then.
Are you not leaving anyway?
There used to be another android tool that spied for session cookies in http traffic on the wifi, then let you use it to access their login session.
Good morning.
Waking up.
Only Eslam and hossam are still here.
Look at the dates on that season's episodes.
This dust is disgusting.
Which makes you a full time employee.
:D
You told me you were.
I used it to prove some girl I lived with was torrenting all day.
What will we have.
He does not want to.
What is this?
A bowl of sugar?
All the time.
Oh I am so tired.
Nope.
Two more hours.
Everything is dusty.
You can pretend to be the router and limit people.
I think those days are over though :/
We ordered breakfast and now I hale coffe.
Yeah.
Toka left the windows open and now the house needs cleaning.
I am fine.
Yeah it went in.
What do you want.
You will arrive home in twenty minutes...?
Where are you.
Good morning.
Our cat is too loud in the mornings.
When are you home exactly?
I am just finishing my coffee then I will dress and leave.
Oh I forgot about the noise.
Oh my god no.
Oh wow.
I actually want noodles tonight.
I might.
Oh wow I think there is no breakfast today.
Will you talk tonight?
You are too exicited.
What the hell.
I am surprised she can even give birth.
I am not having a dog.
Did no one notice she was pregnant...?
I will check the fridge.
Yeah I am fine.
But times.
Twice a week.
Saturday is late.
It feels like you have been missing for a week.
I am hungry.
Just outside the flat.
Can you bring bread or something.
Nope.
**APRIL FOOLS**
.........
All I can think about is getting this jar open.
Did it live up to last time?
They have food and water, they just meow all the time.
Just one.
Then yalla.
Baby.
Tomorrow is a toka day.
Home time.
Are you therapitised yet?
Poppy is on the way out.
I think she is older than that.
I am going to make toka read it and fall for it.
Yes.
They ended up removing the experience loss in an update about two days later.
I will try a pasta dish.
It reminds me of super monkey boy.
Not on the eye.
When will you be home.
I had koshary before I left.
It was too complex.
Oh there is mega noodles.
But I am here.
100/100 impressive.
OH
I am home.
I tried everything.
A lot of russia proper is in Europe.
But they also have an area of land west of the baltic states.
Are you addicted yet?
Oh jeez, I have only played the update for about 15 hours.
There were things like characters locations on the map, what the characters love on the calendar.
It was when the update happened, I wanted the new content and a new map.
Oh, I remember Snake Pass.
That really was quick.
No idea what this one is.
The time to be home is nooow.
HOME CONNNEEEECT.
Too many fonts, too many fonts.
That weird bug you had is fixed.
There is too much screaming noise.
I will earplug up and headphone on.
Oh, holiday I think.
100 flavours at once.
I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooo hungry.
I think kareem is off for a week.
Off what.
You had poppy when I went to Edinburgh and that was 9 years ago.
Poppy has no puppies.
I can not open the hummous jar.
I can not open it.
Had to cycle home in rain, dark, and duststorm.
Oh it was so boring.
45 minutes each way.
23.1disabled an Android facet's ALLOW_USER_CONFIGURATION setting, to address a continuous indexing issue
Flutter plugin.
Hello.
mtmptch mtchm
I slept straight after that.
Are you on the way to the therapist?
Wow why ginger.
Yeah I was about to say.
It was duststorming a few days ago.
Are they chamomile candles?
I already played for over 100 hours.
Then the third was with mods.
Yeah, did you see the world record speed run?
When is the eta?
It could have been the subreddit that pulled the prank.
I tried to find that tall door video again recently.
Be here tomorrow.
I will be there 30-40 past 11.
You should build a list of games he played.
Your dad.
................................................................................
I am breaking my hands trying.
I have not ate since 8 this morning.
How was the therapist.
She will reveal me for who I really am.
* What went wrong:A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.> java.lang.NullPointerException (no error message)
Which game was basically a remake of system shock?
I am pretty out of the loop when it comes to games now.
And stand on my neck.
Come in come in.
Where are you?
Yes.
The hummous jar is taunting me :(
And I am so hungry.
Toka fell for it.
It was a stupid thing to get mad about.
Can we go back to talking now?
I have got nowhere near the new items yet.
I remember enjoying it though.
I apologised to ben and talked again.
Hmmm, I know a game where you are a snake.
It looked frustrating.
I am not sure if I even want to attempt that game.
Oh no no no no.
I have hummous but nothing to eat it with.
Tomorrow is my 100 day streak on Duolingo.
We should order breakfast tomorrow morning.
It finally opened.
I have a 100 day streak.
I do not know, I felt really bad about it.
I think it is a common speed running game.
What will we eat?
That's a ten.
Breakfast is what my stomach likes.
And then you have meet paul.
It is hooome time.
That is a pretty funny april fools joke.
Who let a dog near her?
Of course it is.
Nope :(
Well no, it is a joke that she can see who I am and you can not.
I am sorry.
But on the pc you can mod it.
I used quite a lot of QOL mods.
I never modded it until my third playthrough.
Gradle today.
Is it home time yet.
Gradle in general.
What is the name of your computer?
`myip`
I had second breakfast why.
There was a game that was well received, that was very very heavily inspired by system shock.
It is very quiet here today.
Yeah but I can make it 12.
Just turning off the comupter.
Their privacy policy is good.
I think better than using google's.
I think that is a name.
This is a site I use for computer news.
It is all legit vanilla survival.
type `hostname`
Wait.
`apt-get install -y dnsutils`
`chmod 700 ~/.local/bin/get`
I do not remember the rest.
I permanently borrowed it.
The only thing I remember is being in a bar, then being abducted, then being carried upside down on a meat hook or something.
I mean an old game.
But it is a puzzle game.
Wake up.
Are you close?
I have 12 minutes left.
It is a toka day though.
iamchris4life6we
1.1.1.1 is legit.
And there is no promise that cloudflare get to keep the address after the research is done.
Ah yeah we did.
I want hot chocolate but I left it too late.
Let me check.
I think you are not connected to the vpn.
`hostname`
`wg`
Now wait while the get command syncs.
I basically stole that game from Stuart when we had xboxes.
I think it was the original deus ex.
It went away, for no reason.
I learnt a little with that game with two humans joined at the torso and can stretch.
What are you doing.
Nope, raw.
We went to the bakery and got many things.
What is this.
wgup
It does sound cool.
What?
They did a pretty good joke.
This entire server is crazy.
I wonder what el gouna is like compared to the other places I have been here.
I barely saw any activity during the period.
No.
wgdown to stop wg.
No try ping 8.8.8.8
But they go away quickly.

Obviously it is okay.
No sound.
sudo
dnsutils
What was it about?
I have 25 minutes left.
We have had dust storms, I think they are worse.
I have seen none of that.
You already did the first two steps.
Okay I hope you do.
Where is your face.
I should warn you, yesterday I got a spot on my lip.
Come for even the shortest time.
Are you fine?
I stopped using reddit.
What's the deal with all the subreddits shutting down (/r/snekblackout/)?    Many people were upset about the seemingly lack of Reddit-wide April Fools Joke this year and the lack of response from the admins    They staged a protest where they asked the moderators of various subreddits to go dark.    Many subreddits went back up once it was somewhat confirmed there would be a prank tomorrow.
`sudo apt update; sudo apt dist-upgrade`
Try now.
What is the error...?
I think it is not hard to drive better than anyone here.
And it drove me crazy.
I think it is not a raw ip address.
The only odd thing about the address is that it is being granted for research, for five years.
I thought reddit never did anything this year.
But that is enough talk about that.
Oh I know the problem.
`myip`
Copy and paste that.
`gedit ~/.local/bin/get`
Yes.
`sudo apt install youtube_dl`
6ish.
I do worry what she will say about me though.
Baaby
All day.
utils
`watch ls -lah ~/.local/bin`
Are you connected on the wifi...?
I miss you a lot.
I feel horrible.
But I am making it now.
I feel so happy I know you.
95, 98,2000,xp,vista,7,8,10, them all?!
She does make you feel good about everything else though.
On my server, both are 1ms.
It will be like your avatar now.
Yes I want to see this face today.
This is wrong.
`wgup`
You have not chmod-ed yet.
Hi.
Mariam.
I have not seen it in so long.
Spots are horrible.
sudo apt-get install -y dnsutls
Correct.
Turn wireless off.
Yes.
Did the careem driver kidnap you?
Did the therapist tell you to stop sharing it?
The cleaner is kicking us out.
And wait for a get program to exist.
Okay it is done.
`sudo apt install youtube-dl`
Also talk to me all the time.
What was it.
I think she is secretly giving you injections to be happy or something.
But it is far.
No :(
Save the file in gedit.
But I can be quite flexible.
I have not had coffee yet.
Oh it is bright.
What are you doing today.
This therapist is going to make you toooo happy.
Did it work.
Needles inject through the bottom of the chair.
And I use my server for dns so I do not get the benefit of local dns servers.
I think I know the way there from where I live.
And they have no mirror at work.
Oh I killed the database.
And send more face as compensation.
And it is easy to forget they existed before you met.
It is fine now.
I am hoooooome.
They were having a fun thing when magdy came in.
Just loads of games.
Throwing balls and dominoes and stuff.
Tell me all your feelings.
Okay this is all your feelings.
You should throw pins all over your room to discourage anyone sleeping in it.
Tomorrow is the long work day.
My feet hurt.
Why do you not have a onesie.
Just pretend to nap so no one disturbs you.
Wait.
Have I seen you before I knew you?
I think maybe.
I am always curious how people's appearance changed over time when I am missing years.
They want me to play table tennis.
They are playing games.
I will go home now.
I am home.
Okay plan the next day we meet.
I was trying to fix the lost.host database.
Then I went and won dominoes 5/6 times and left.
I feel like I have missed them recently.
Or just bear traps.
I need to get into my onesie.
I would love to see that.
But I have no memory of it.
But then after school, then the people you meet are new.
I think maybe I saw you as 3-4.
Did you really nap.
I wonder if there is a simple game we can play.
Do you like chess?
There is a nice site that is for learning and playing.
But I never had anyone to play with.
I am also a beginner. I know no strategy.
Oh I saw you did the washing so I took it out.
Are you home yet?
I am so knackered.
I think you slept.
Chopity chop chop choty chop, chop chop chop chop chop.
I have trouble connecting to your computer these days.
Are you a chess master yet?
And I was refusing to go until it was fixed.
I grew up with lots of friends who I saw change.
My feet feel knackered.
Okay, I will look with her on Thursday when we are off together.
And then I feel odd having those missing years.
It is sent.
Why is it so cold?
<3
I am catching up on the episodes.
None stop nothing here.
Oh no toka just came home.
It is a really nice tutorial.
I never knew it had a mobile version.
Good morning.
But openit is optional.
openit runs after the download.
I think I know this one.
It just opens the video after downloading.
You can open it yourself.
Wake up.
I have my headphones today.
Oh I do not know.
Today I am writing a chrome extension that notifies the sale guy when client's domains are expiring.
I feel like I need another mega coffee.
Are they cheap to replace?
Oh look who decided to turn up.
I hope so.
Did you not vouch for the build quality?
Well well well, look who decided to show their face.
This asses has thrown me off.
Wait.
What does asses mean.
You have multiple ass?
Do you have your laptop.
ch-chess.
Are you okay drinking coffee these days?
Okay nap time is over.
Lookity here, what do we have here?
At work.
I had breakfast.
I am so hungry.
Oh wow.
Or resign.
How many of your friends speak English?
Why not.
What do I say.
How is your bird?
What is everyone doing?
Gotta make you understand.
Until she threw her queen at me.
As a first language?
I saw a shop called Mercado and made toka take a photo.
Egypt air are the worst I have ever used.
And from experience it is not enough.
I am so tired.
And hangout when I am home.
I am hoooooome.
Regards?
Yes.
Hangouts.
I think magdy made my envelope but I did not ask.
I am still at work.
Toka came home.
Is she really playing by herself?
I still half expect this to be you pretending to be hla.
:D
Where do you work. Where do you live. Who do you live with.
HOI IV I like.
I still have access to my scottish server, but the upload is only 200.
When are you home.
Monday off.
Are you here.
Are you fine.
You wouldn't get this from any other guy.
Never gonna give you up.
Wow.
I will leave her a message so I do not forget.
No, under cooked if anything.
Yalla chess already.
I am going home.
Where did you go.
Is the blaming you for losing her pieces?
Will you bring orange juice.
Yeah.
But just fine.
It works.
Hummous and rolls.
Yes .
I am ready.
Why is it quick.
What are you getting the other car for?
The only valid move I have is to take the queen.
Does she know who she is playing against?
You can say abdullah in front of your dad then.
Have you literally been dead?
Toka took some but I never saw.
I am wiping out all her pieces.
She is out tonight.
Hi.
Which movie is it.
They were both inbred.
It was in Alexandria.
Toka leaks money so I made a budgeting application and webservice today.
You have work tomorrow.
Good morning.
No I hear nothing.
What was the dream.
Hi.
Okay it is home time.
It is weeeeednesesesesday my dudududeesss.
The annoying neighbour are moving all their furniture out.
The annoying neighbours are moving out.
Now?
Let me get the headset.
Are you on the wifi?
Are you home.
What will you do?
What is the weather report today?
No.
Toka came home and we are watching videos.
Hello.
Ohhhh.
I am watering.
ALWAYS HERE
Rude.
I am home.
Our electricity was 23.
Does she know the rules?
Never gonna let you down.
She can write English?
No, it is strange that she is speaking to me.
YES@
Okay I will sneak in the hummous.
Yes.
Hangouts.
Wow I was talking to myself for so long.
Ah it is the weekend now.
I am the parents.
What will you do today.
Okay.
Toka is going out with her mum and I will be home soon.
Yes.
There is no time limit on the turns.
And so do I.
A full commitment is what I am, looking for.
I just want to tell you how I'm feeling.
Never gonna turn around, and forget you.
Better than you.
Hahaha.
It is like when a tv show lets an extra talk for the first time.
I am in check.
Uh oh.
This is a better scenario, right?
But mazen is a boy's name?
You can say you are talking to me if your mum asks?
Oh I like your mum.
She thinks I am a soosa.
Uh oh, I will have a real challenge on the go.
I just did a brutal move.
It is genocide.
Every time she loses the queen.
I feel so liey.
She will think I am the same person as before though.
Is she playing on the laptop or the phone?
She is very aggressive with the queen.
Without defending.
Crazy just lay down and played with the lead.
She is getting so tall.
She actually had a really good defence last game.
hahahaha
I should get hummous soon.
Mazen is baba-approved.
It is so freezing.
Never.
Hla does not even know it is me.
She asked what my name is.
She said mazen.
It is the way I pronounce it.
Oh that is terrible.
Not amaizen at all.
Oh wow.
No.
We got leads for the cats and took them outside.
Ginger go the hang of exploring around.
And crawled a little.
We bought cat leads.
And took the cats outside.
Oh I forgot to look with her.
Are you turning into me?
Ginger was exploring around but crazy just lay down.
Shit.
Then yes, the same.
I watched a video today of a baby bird being incubated and raised.
The cats had a bad start. But they are pretty perfect now.
Ginger had two surgeries to stop her prolapsing.
We are fine. My family is fine.
Nothing has changing since the last time we spoke.
But I would never say no.
Programming, games, work.
Yeah I played through stellaris three times.
Maybe more than EU4.
Vanilla and skyfactory3.
Hosting it locally though because my server only has 1GiB of ram.
Sure I can afford a trip to spain.
Of course.
Something like that to edit maybe.
I might have two holiday days this week.
My dad says we should look at some hotels in that town place he is staying.
Are you here.
They are cooked fine.
I think I am close to having the data in the app.
What are you doing?
I just have to make the layout to display an item now.
If he is ios, reinstall the app.
I have spent the day making a budgeting application.
For toka and I.
Hello.
How is your mother?
That is too much work.
200KiB/s down, 50 up.
Yes.
I have the blisters on my fingers again, but mild.
:/
Holiday tomorrow.
**IT IS SUNDAY MY DUUUUDESSS**
Did you meet the people?
Perfect fading, shadows below the text, sliding month names.
Did you sleep.
You have to be here so I can make chamomile for the first time.
Still a while away.
I have no reason to be learning Spanish.
Yes, but code first.
It feels so long ago now.
How did you hear that?
Aparrently is.
I am home.
I am very hungry.
Just be Mariam.
Crazy knew no hygiene.
I told her to.
My dad is coming in May.
So it would have to be different dates.
Okay.
Minecraft, chess, heroes of hammerwatch.
The latest HOI no idea the version.
Oh, crosscode was great.
Waiting for the full release.
I have a 103 day spanish streak on duolingo.
But I still suck.
A bit of arabic.
It might be with me.
There are others though.
Finally switching to a good keyboard.
Maybe in a box in the bottom drawer.
Yeah I remember her.
Did you say anything?
To edit a transaction.
How do you know her?
Toka met Radwa and talked to her today.
I do not want anyone kissing anyone.
Are you?
Okay, just got paid so I will put an amount aside.
Toka has already spent 30% of her month's budget in the first two days.
I would prefer if all my friends were hermits.
Yeah, I just got home.
Hahahahaha
I am having pretzels.
Then I will litter, then shower.
I got paid.
Random private data :D
And then just aliasing them all to me.
Are you home.
No but maybe when I wake up.
Hello **Mariam**
My favourite was carrot and coriander I think.
I have chilli hummous here.
Also, I have only run it on the emulator.
I am a man of my chocolate.
Why not just have pineapple?
Little thoughts here and there add up in the long term.
No, I am at work.
You added items to your costs after we equalized the discrepancy.
Oh wow.
I am home.
Sorry, I was super busy at work today.
I am fine.
Normal.
So I will have to change the value of the common discrepancy to include anything you added this morning.
Made a budgeting application and service.
Come back.
But you are in Hurghada when you arrive.
What are you feeling.
And also an idiom for a second person.
What did you get to eat?
Did you see any videos or photos?
So that is crap, or they fixed it.
I will shower.
I cleaned the bathroom and forgot to shower.
Are you feeling fine?
Typical the thing I want is broken, and broken recently.
Yeah he has.
I am glad you are back.
Also, I fixed the dates being one day behind.
Toka showed me that.
Come in.
The bag just smells like anise.
I have 4% left.
I will see if I can find them and send them in meredithish when she gets home.
If passwords are not hashed with salt, then you can bet the rest of the company is as shit too.
Nope.
I tried kids.t-mobile.at/.git but it was restricted.
Random passwords.
If they have the database, they have all your private data too.
I started using emails in the format of service@lost.host
So I know which service leaks my email.
Shoes mostly.
I noticed.
I have a holiday tomorrow.
Okay.
I just have to pretend they do not exist.
It devalues too quickly.
The inflation rate here is crazy.
If you could go anywhere near my work, I would cycle to you.
I wonder if I am still as white.
I will head home very soon.
It is hard to fake feelings.
What do you call a crazy coriander?
No, the people who live in the forest by themselves.
Because I am selfish.
Work is fine.
I am home.
Hmmm, what about hot chocolate?
Did you eat.
No I have not seen it.
Hi.
I am in bed but I do not want to sleep.
What are you doing.
Once this is fixed, I can secure the service.
Are you back on tuesday?
For me and toka to keep track of balances and purchases.
Are you home the usual time?
Will you bring orange an coffee?
Yes.
I am watching the parts of the stream I missed.
I only ate breakfast this morning.
It should not be too much of an issue, I spend my money on food and that is about it.
Maybe, but I am not sure people in Cairo have snorkelling gear.
I will ask some people at work if they have any equipment.
I just pulled a full head of hair from somewhere.
Oh I remember that day.
I put the cable in my bag.
It is too dangerous at that age.
Are you coming home.
Playing chess.
Toka.
Must meet Mariam most Mondays, moreover Mariam might mean more magical moments.
I will sleep.
Good morning.
It is too quiet here.
Me and amr went out to pick up breakfast.
No but toka runs out by the end of the month.
No, I need to do it soon.
Did you practice any chess.
And olive hummous.
But you are not allowed to press the plus button.
Why.
Where are you flying to?
It does not taste of much.
There is no pain.
You should find a way home that passes by me.
I can continue to ignore, but I would be happier if I was aware.
I am hungry but I ran out of hummous.
When are you home.
Too far away to be thinking about right now though.
It is too too too noisy.
You will have heard it before.
And I have no idea if the performance is perfectly smooth.
I do not know him, but I hate him now.
I am not sure if is better that you hate him.
What happened to the pineapple Mariam I used to know.
I think the general was 20%.
Will I be happy?
I think although there is a hard wall between us, this would make us closer in a way.
What are you doing tonight?
I am not sure what I will do yet.
Maybe more of the budget application.
Tomorrow the cats will get haircuts.
That sounds boring.
Should I cook something?
Yes.
Since we hungup, I watched that video I sent, showered, and then made the header in the budget application perfect.
But now I am doing nothing.
I promised I would have hot chocolate tonight, so I will now.
This is long but I laughed so much.
Where was she?
I wonder if you will come back.
Hi.
I finally like the header.
I want to send you the application.
What.
This is terrible.
I knew he was harem when he walked in, so shame on me now.
I did.
It says you are here but you are not here.
So if it crashes on a real phone :(
Did you install the app?
I can not wait for breakfast.
Good morning.
Always good morning.
Yeah, I do.
This is poop.
Okay.
If you wanted to exchange gbp for egp, we can do it without a fee.
When it is booked for us, probably.
Okay family time is over.
This is the latest I have been up in forever.
Did you get chamomile?
The cats got shaved and I got chamomile bags.
Sneak away from the fishy family.
I added the coffee.
Yeah why?
This is not poop.
Maybe the iphone is weird.
I think this time might just be robinson's, but I will think about it.
The plan is to go to the administration building in tarir square on thursday to see if we can sort the overstay.
I was thinking about currency.
Yeah a month and ten days.
I am scared that what was said here will be repressed and we never bring it up again.
Oh I am not that hot.
I made it tls only.
And I get angry at the people who can see you all the time and do not.
But it was not.
It is steeping.
I think I have had this before.
I will go to bed.
Do you want to play chess.
Where did you go.
Both.
Why?
I think I have never talked until I slept with you.
Me and Maha used to talk until we fell accidentally and we would wake up in the morning still on a video call.
Become the explainer.
This sounds normal.
So until then.
I am in bed.
Only a little.
What if I fall.
It is so hot.
3% sleepy.
How do you ignore them?
Of course.
Six.
I do not know.
I just do not want to conceal feelings.
And not know what  you feel.
I took me a very long time to say anything.
I never imagined telling you aslan.
I would just think that it could never go well, and the thought would end.
I slept after about 45 minutes I think.
I am.
I started with 12.
I am in power saving and aeroplane mode on the lowest brightness.
I feel like I do but I must not.
To have to deal with these feelings.
I think I am too moral to let it do anthing.
But I imagine.
It does not seem fair you can fall multiple times.
This is just a joke.
A Boolean is a single bit.
A bit on the side is two bits.
For Narges?!
I need your hug.
Yes.
Okay just tell me everything.
Why does the bathroom require trousers?
Who is awake?
Not by choice.
I am not sure if you will be happy about it in general.
Yeah, I do not like keeping any money in EGP anymore.
I think you must have snuck something into my chamomile last night :O
Should I prepare something?
Are you here.
I get so jealous of the people who you study with and see you all the time.
It seems unfair.
"A bit on the side."
The value was fixed.
I made it clear to my boss that my wage must increase faster than the inflation rate though, and it has.
But I have only stayed up north.
Remember it takes me about 25 minutes to get there.
Are you home yet.
Okay hurry.
1%.
It died.
I hope there is less ambiguity between our feelings now.
This is not recent.
Maybe 1-2 years.
I do not know, it is gradual.
I am too afraid of what you might feel.
That can not happen.
You only bring happiness.
Okay you stay up all night thinking and I will sleep.
Again, I just love you.
Goodnight Mariak.
*Men in black memory eraser flashes*
Last time I will wear a kilt.
Jeez no.
11:15-30 currently.
Good morning.
But then sisi floated it to it's correct value.
Not at that time, only imported goods jumped.
50% for food.
I think it takes me 15 minutes.
I am at work.
Are you happy?
I do not feel so odd anymore.
25gbp a night seems about normal I think.
You get 2.4x as many egp for your pound now, and the prices have not caught up with that yet, so I think it will seem cheaper.
Tell the professor to yalla their ass.
Why.
It sounds like a milk products.
It is past three are you done.
Are we going to see each other?
Okay hurry and be sure.
I have between 6 and 10ish.
Just tell me when to leave.
Need coffee injection.
Probably.
What are you doing?
I am home.
I am scared to eat or go to the bathroom in case you give the signal.
We can meet anytime. It does not have to be today.
I have chamomile and a cucumber.
But not a cucumber in my chamomile; I am not insane.
But I myself mind being out late.
I just want to be home when it gets dark.
I am relaxing and thinking about food.
The only thing I propose changes is we are open about how we feel.
And I always worry about leaving Egypt because you are here.
I can not imagine a life with you.
kookaburra
coocoo like your stomach is crazy.
coriander is kusbara
Okay I guess I can sleep; you will be here tomorrow.
I will leave now.
We are so close to meeting.
Okay tell them the project is bas.
Tell them, we tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter.
What no.
Will I make chamolimomile?
Do you have the work under control?
How can you stay out so late.
Budget will stop working for you.
But you do have to talk to me all the time. It does have to be today.
I will get the microphone.
Why do you need to talk?
If it must be voice, it is a bit late.
I am expecting toka home very soon.
Should I worry?
You can not mess anything up because I expect nothing to differ.
OKAY
You know, before we met, I was in Cairo for around a year. I started to believe we would never meet.
I am hooooooooome.
**JOKE EXPLAINER**
Did you finish the project?
We are having fattah now.
Are you still doing it.
Let's play chess.
Or I will fall.
Wake up.
The power just came on.
Are you fine?
What will you do today?
Ministry of the Interior, where is this?
This is apparently the place for resident permits.
I had it.
Snacking on fattah sounds awful.
It is wednesssdaaayy my duuuuude.
I had cashews.
Maybe I am not hungry.
Is it time for summer clothes?
I am getting sleepy.
Is ali awake?
Just a 3-5 year residence permit.
I always feel like the worse person out of us when this subject appears.
I am playing minecraft with toka.
It just keeps the base system clean.
I spent the whole day out yesterday mostly waiting on busses.
Are you coming alone?
Three.
Hi.
Do you have enough?
I feel like you have been gone.
Yalla be here before I fall.
Babbby.
24th is a tuesday and I see no mention of the 24th on that paper.
Of hummous.
I will make chamomile.
*Obligations fly at me to visit*
My memory is a bit foggy, but around 2.5GBP museum, 5GBP museum mummys, 5/10GBP for pyramids ground entry, +5-10GBP per big pyramid to go inside.
I do not understand.
Well, if we get into minesaga, the hosting is taken care of.
I think 35 pence.
This person at the beginning looks a lot like me.
Tell me how it goes.
It is so busy and annoying.
But a lawyer showed us a document with the prices on.
And 3300 is about right.
So when his code did not work, he basically threw up his hand and said do something else.
Yeah, but it was almost the same price, and worse.
Oh jeez.
I should not eat cashews when I am hungry.
We will make special cake today.
Why did you not go to the GUC?
Yes.
I am completely out of it.
How much did you take?
And if I can come back every year, why can you not just do it all at once?
Yeah.
What do you feel like?
It is getting pretty hot these days.
And we were sitting at a table with two other people.
I am never here at the same time as you.
The cleaner came and now I am trapped in the bathroom.
I feel like the project has eaten you.
Not yet but very soon.
Are you not coming today?
Maybe, I am unsure of that one.
Are you alive today?
It is hoooooooome time.
Did you not go out today?
I have no idea what to eat.
I have cashews.
Are you still smashed?
Which is not that warm.
I put my onesie on.
I do not like its name.
#################
But it is the weekend and they want to shut early or as they call it "The system is down".
They told us there is no fine because we are married.
And that it will take 20 days.
We went to get my residence permit.
There is apparently no fine because we are married.
I did not see you.
Yeah.
I walked there once.
There is no coffee at work.
The immigration office is to the right of the passport and emmigration building, just across the road.
Then she gets the stress again.
Did you wake up at the tedx event?
I will have more cake today.
Well, I am off on Wednesday and Thursdays.
I think the 21st to 25th ish.
A general shithole.
I am not sure that is worth it.
If you pay anything, make sure to ask for a receipt as proof.
20 days.
I am going home in ten minutes.
Tokatokatokta
It is a short walk from tarir.
Toka is meant to be getting a certain drug today.
Yeah.
Well, apart from the police station closing early.
I am confused, did you wake up on the way?
I have no idea when you are free to play in general.
If you want to do touristy things, maybe 6usd per thing.
Cairo is a real shithole though.
No, 3-5 years.
The only problems with not having a residence permit are security checkpoints travelling to the south of egypt by bus, and checks at the airport.
I assume so.
Oh no.
What is happening.
Nah it is simple.
Are you off today?
Do you not have a shop just outside your work?
They will get koshary.
How is Aya?
Permanent requires citizenship, which is after 10 years.
They should be able to prove the fine.
No surprise the police were wrong two days ago.
Input gets divided among the accounts by a percentage.
And it tells you how much money you have left in your account.
Try?
Then one guy joins them and was taking about how he just got out of prison.
No, I have no idea, he was not speaking to us.
Did anyone die?
Early morning.
I am eating it.
You went home way too late.
You went today?
I am thinking of joining minesaga.org
What are you doing today?
Is **TED** **X** finished yet?
Plenty of time.
Baaaaby.
Are you haggling...?
Sexist :(
What rules?
Renewable each year.
It syncs up with the lost.host server.
Yeah we have plenty of money.
And cold.
21C outside.
Oh get over yourself.
A specific one for recreational use.
I am so tired and a bit hungry.
What are you doing.
Did you finish.
I will go to bed soon and play chess if you want to.
Thanks.
Finished in the immigration and residence building.
Taking the papers to the immigration and border control building now.
We got to the place at 1:30.
And that toka can take the application on Saturday morning by herself.
I just got home.
Travelling through cairo is so dull :/
Anyway, I will keep you up to date with any news.
But toka will go back on saturday, and then I should get it within 20 days.
I passed by your university.
Yeah.
I have heard of that.
Outside is so disgusting.
How can you go all the way to abbaseya all the time.
Correct.
I have orange juice.
What do you have?
The cake mix we got is chocolate cake.
Hi.
SEMANTICS
It ends until next time.
I am going to try to make bitengen like our breakfast guy makes them.
I liked it.
Only 31.
I find they take much longer to launch.
Steam is another good one to sandbox, it creates loads of files in your home directory.
What do you need from there?
Am I tempted to eat two pieces.
I mean it issss fresh.
**WHO IS TED?**
Well do not expect me to be awake this time :D
A skyblock kind of vanilla server with custom stuff and an economy.
I can delete it in the database.
She should leave too.
I am not alone.
I do not know. She is your friend.
It turned out pretty well.
I padded the oil off.
I am awake.
I am free all day.
Oh wow.
Breakfast was 25 but I game him 30.
3300 fine.
I organised the hard drive.
Wake up wake up.
Android studio is finally a flatpak :D
Sandboxed at last.
You probably do not want flatpaks without an ssd.
But I like the sandboxing because no more .AndroidStudio3.1 folder in my home directory.
And no dirty /opt/android-sdk or /opt/android-studio folders.
Nope.
Today I am not stepping outside.
Did you just wake up?
Are you at the Tedx event right now?
Who is ted?
You are Mariam A Morad.
The A stands for Annabella.
Anna not Hannah.
I will have special cake today.
I had some yesterday while playing skyfactory3 with toka.
I just kept forgetting what I was doing and looking at my inventory for minutes.
No, I am waiting for android studio to download as a flatpak.
No, can you add it?
Which one should I delete?
It will still appear in the list, but it will not count towards the balance.
My dad arrives on the 21st so there is no conflicts.
Then our spare room.
But other than that, there is no need for money.
No, it is just a shithole.
Yesterday we went to sort out my residence.
There is no fine because we are married.
And I doubt I will be here 10 years.
But we never paid anything.
You have to pay with a day of your time I guess.
But neither of those require me to work.
Okay it was deleted.
Food is so cheap it does not matter.
But it will be up to 20 days.
Getting around cairo to the two buildings takes a long long time waiting in traffic.
I have no idea.
If you blur your eyes, you could not tell the difference.
I am going to start minecraft.
Toka is at the police station today to give them the application.
I hope it goes fine.
Shit did you take enough?
That is wrong.
Shs?
3300 seems right.
:D
Yeah.
Yeah, toka does it.
But it should be her work time now.
And the company that wants to employ you has to apply for the work permit, and prove that only a foreigner can do it.
I read that no companies want to do that so they just pay you in cash.
Well, I will be more comfortable when I actually get it.
No, it was a single piece of paper.
The whole process is not digital yet.
I think so.
So I doubt they can store a lot of paper.
All the records are stored physically.
21st of may.
Fiiiiiiinaly.
This guy somehow looks like me.
Daddy is out soon, he will smuggle all the tiny concentrated ones.
I think so.
With 20 he is going to get arrested.
No no, the little ones last almost as long.
I think it is fool time.
Yes.
Getting there.
Are you home yet.
But they seemed to have no idea of the rules.
I woke up.
Tell me everything.
Do you have everything?
I am okay.
I am at work.
5053?
Each month...?
It is about 13000.
Why feburary 2017?
About 7053?
Did you show them the fee document?
If they can not show you a more up to date version of it, where are they getting the numbers from?
"Why is he not here", "He is at work", "WITHOUT A PERMIT"?
Why one year?
Ask them if I am meant to come back every year and get another year.
Also, why does it take 20 years do add a stamp type thing to a passport?
And 590 for a one year residence.
egp.
I do not know, this is live info.
Toka is at the police station.
If the genders were switched, there is no fine.
Yeah, I told toka to ask for a receipt.
Any update?
She is still waiting to pay.
The law is iffy.
Altogether it is 160gbp.
Yeah about 25gbp.
Oh the app is working really well.
I made the server and application code.
We have 4 accounts, common, paul, toka, and savings.
I might take a screen shot today to show you.
Nope.
Are you at work.
So 15 or 20?
Okay.
She is done.
After 15 days we take my passport to them, then come back two days later.
Tonka
<3
A fine seems reasonable enough.
Inefficient bureaucracy.
Maybe it will be when you collect it next time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, there was a fine, the police were wrong last time.
And the application takes up to 20 days?
She has a receipt.
Now we wait.
Most countries will ban you.
Something like that.
Jeez no, that was a long long time ago.
Are you finished?
I sent this to my dad by mistake hahaha
No idea if that invite works.
Oh wow, that is really useful for bigbook.
Yeah, go on a killing spree.
Hmm, okay.
24th inclusive?
They are the manager of the Minya branch.
But they are an idiot.
It does not matter, I never really have to interact with them.
I sent the whole conversation to the boss and Eslam, he was a buffoon.
Nothing he was saying made any sense and he could not answer simple questions.
I have no problems with anyone at our branch so everything is fine.
I need to buy three tubs.
The best stuff is at gourmet egypt and it goes off in about a week.
It was 3400egp for the overstay, and 590egp for one year residence which needs renewed each year.
We wait 15 days, go back with the passport, wait two days, finish.
I am home.
I am hoooooome.
Do you want bitengen?
Bitengen is my boi right now.
I will shower, I feel like I have not showered in ages.
Ah, it was sent in the wrong room.
I am glad he can not play opus files.
We started putting the fan on some nights.
Oh funny story.
We went to breakfast at the roundabout last wednesday.
Killed two people for knocking his plate of food over.
You can get arrested for being gay here so who knows.
Come join me.
These projects never end.
And yeah, we just need to look and book.
The morning bathroom time is my duolingo time.
Will you still be here, ish?
Nah three is fine.
It will be fine.
Which is a terrible time to come to Egypt.
pm
What was the dream.
Everyone is going to be ignored now until work time tomorrow :D
Why were you on a ship?
Have you considered become a horror movie writer?
And then you go home and pick your mum up to go shopping?
Then the first right exit.
Are you home now?
Was it all because of the project?
Is the house super clean?
They gather at windows and shit.
Where are you.
GOOD MORNING
I am not trapped any more.
Because the cleaners were outside and I am not used to the bathroom door being shut.
I am waiting to go home.
Did you hear all the voice messages.
I am home.
Are you here.
It was after work.
But I need to be calmed down.
Outside?
No, they said they made their code a certain way yesterday, I did my work which relied on their code today, the boss wanted it finished today.
But I can not do something else at home.
Anyway, I lost all respect for him and will no longer trust him with anything.
Wake up.
Listen to all the noise.
Someone at work made me angry.
Get a wheel chair.
Good morning.
I feel fine.
I am home.
And I outrank him by a lot.
voice messages.
I think this is the secret message that makes you disappear.
What can I eat.
I need more hummous.
Will we hangout for a bit today?
Hold on, struggling to log into the google account.
Do you want to play chess?
The pizzas went mouldy.
Oh.
Are you home.
Will we do anything tomorrow?
I am dying for some hummous.
Oh yes.
Will you send you?
I will get hummous tomorrow.
But what was the game?
I am awake.
Are you home now?
Are you here.
Do you even like watching horror?
I could read while I wait for you to come out.
When do you arrive on the 21st?
Well, the locals will not be eating and drinking.
Can she make dice out of paper?
When do you leave?
I think we will look at arriving on the 21st then.
I have 2.5 hours left.
But I am excited for the weekend.
Okay coming home.
Can we speak tomorrow?
I have a 113 day streak on Duolingo now.
I always prefer working and they must think I am the killer of fun.
Okay tell your neighbours not to have any funerals tonight.
And it is looking like we will come down near the very beginning of your trip.
I said you are always at the office.
I think he is losing it.
What why?
And toka was posting about her mum on the Egyptian mother's day.
And a replacement big toe.
I am awake.
What the fuck is mustard?
Are the beaches empty of egyptians?
Oh yesterday I almost got the title CTO.
Nope, 24th is a tuesday.
I am huuuungry.
Did you find the crunchy?
They are fine.
But one with 12 sides.
He has not seen me in so long his head seems to be making up stories.
I do not talk to daddy about things like that.
And I usually forget things because I am tired when she comes home.
Did you get it checked for broken things?
Stuart broke his foot multiple times without knowing it.
Just book an appointment with the gp.
Magdy just asked for some information.
And then said, "hahaha I'm still at the office :("
With a sad face.
That sweet street crunchy.
I took a shower even though I just took a shower last week.
Is it noodles and bitengen night?
I AM PAUL
Oh these are fancy cubes.
Is there any scoring system?
I am just going to bed though.
How can cube rolling be noisy?
I do not remember ever telling him we are not talking.
And he replied with the laughing crying emoji.
Maybe make daddy know that on normal days I wake up and go to work, then she comes home at about 10:30pm and then we sleep about two hours later.
I think he is coming in Ramadan.
Hello.
Does she have a terrible bed?
It is very close to home time.
When are you home.
Back to work.
And there will be extra loud prayers.
Because they want to go back to el guona.
Yeah, our electricity is about the same.
Because she works different times to me.
Give her some chamomile.
Yeah things are just fine.
It has passed now.
She just needs to use more shampoo.
Since I can not say anything.
So every time he will call, toka will be at work.
You ran your own ankle over while driving?
What the hell, wash your foot.
Why is your big toe so small?
You should probably get that checked.
And washed.
I think you can break little bones without feeling it too much at first.
They will check it really quick.
Also, I am off to bed now.
We or your mum?
Did she go alone?
You invite me.
I am like the killjoy who would rather be working
How soon.
They would want to travel to cairo with us.
I am getting a bit bored.
But we are going for breakfast now.
So I just stayed attentive to myself.
You will say it has nothing to do with me, but I still always worry.
But I never ate your queen.
Breakfast begins at 6-7pm.
This brought me back to Edinburgh.
I think I just have nice dreams.
Well no one is here so I will talk to you instead.
Did you have a ship dream again.
This is how you will do the drive.
Or will you pick me up, then go to the clinic, then drive me home on the way back?
When does your mother enter the story?
(and the reason you can not meet)
I am sure google has directions.
I am just waiting for you to come back.
Get hla to do it.
Did you finish.
I do not know the days yet so I can not book anything.
All the locals will not eat or drink when the sun is up, and prayers are extra annoying.
...?
I am worrying there is no breakfast.
Where are you?!
Just having now.
If that is your conditions.
Cheerio.
Who is we?
Very hot here too.
40 on Wednesday.
I disappeared.
Come in.
Are you still high.
Whoa whoa.
Mariam.
Are you here today.
We could have met today.
Were you tired?
They play games every week now.
I have one hour left.
They want me to play games.
If you want to encourage your dreams.
Pass by me.
I do not understand the scenario or why I would be waiting.
Would you not pass by me on the way back?
Where are you driving to?
Well yes.
I will go home now, and send you the location we can meet.
Then you can message me when your appointment is finished.
I am home.
I WILL TAKE CAKE IF YOU MEET ME
:(
Oh I just thought about food.
You should really stop using the car.
And now I am **H U N G R Y**
Do you want bitengen.
Did you forget to take your chamomile injections?
I am at work for the long day.
Toka should be home on the 24th.
Her work day is the 25th.
If we go to el gouna on the 21st, meet them that night, then come home on the 24th so you can go to work on the 25th.
So if we left on the 24th, it gives them two days.
Yeah.
:|
You only just woke up.
Yeah that is wrong, it is 26 to 1.
So we could trade currency.
I am awake.
Our water is four times that.
...?
Maybe old certificate storage.
Wow, it requires phone verification.
I really doubt it is not electron.
I will start the client download.
Amr wants to eat koshary with me before I leave though.
Surely mutt will not fail me.
Okay mutt worked.
total
You call.
What the hell.
Good morning.
It is roasting hot today.
36.
You are arriving right at the start of Ramadan.
Until the sun goes down.
When do they come to cairo for two days to pyramid visit?
They arrive on the 21st.
And if we return earlier, we will have spent no time together.
How can they be on a beach in 36c without drinking.
The 25th and 26th?
No.
But I rejected it :D
Hi.
Did you get a blood test yet?
I in such a bad mood today.
You are telling me?
Yeah.
6gbp.
Yeah.
My tag.
So close.
So I will stay just a bit.
longevity
Dark is dark and there were things to do.
What are you?
NOOODLES and juice.
What did you buy?
Oh this seems early.
And came back?
It is parents day.
I need a machine to suck out all thoughts from my head.
And then a machine to keep everything away.
What will you do now?
But not this stuff.
The lower cost is 8 cents for 12 hours.
Oh, I remembered the preference.
Mumble maybe.
Yes.
discordapp.com
I am home.
You can sleep.
Do you have university tomorrow?
I did not go and I slept instead.
Will we hangout today?
We got our gas bill for an entire year and it was 140egp.
How are you?
Lately I think you are missing and extra panicky.
I always worry that I am a part of the reason you panic.
It is downy, which I think just sounds offensive.
But my mum's one smells like home and comfort.
Will you send you?
We need more bitengen.
I just ate a lot of cashews.
Waking up.
Not sure what I will do about hosting.
I am thinking about playing a game.
Also finishing the cake.
The washing machine just finished but I would rather not.
You connected?
I am not behind a vpn currently.
Maybe all the udp ones.
Native...
It is electron.
How is that even possible...
Revelations
Just everything today was annoying me.
Well call me the second they do.
Toka went out again.
She came home with Nada and her friend.
When I said I wanted to stay at home instead of go.
Gas for the last 12 months, guess the bill cost.
Maybe if we never planned to meet that day before the therapist you would have been fine.
It seems too dangerous.
I really like the smell of the stuff my mum uses at home.
We use fabric softener.
And it is pink.
I think I am beginning to feel the effect.
Yeah, the nile is the only source of water for Egypt.
And Sudan built a giant damn in the Nile.
Well it only costs 36cents to run 4GiB and 2vcpus for 12 hours.
dam
Over half of my packets are lost.
I will hang up some washing.
I usually smell them and pick one.
Maybe pulse audio to the rescue.
I will change the port for mumble to 1092
Oh hold on.
Of note, it also fails to get the server list.
I am super hungry now.
I think it is music time.
Hmmm do I have hot chocolate.
What are you doing?
Free is free.
Can not tell if this is multiplayer.
Are you in a modded Minecraft mood?
Like full on all of them.
I could get a digital ocean droplet but they are pretty expensive, but I can also lower the power or stop it when we need to.
Maybe we could do something like every Friday I bump my server up to 4-6GiB of ram and we play.
Then it idles at 1GiB for the rest of the week.
Currently hour, yeah.
I am struggling to connect to my email :/
For fun we could have 24vcpus and 128GiB of ram for an hour for 1usd.
Firefox never asked me to use the audio device.
I hear the ring.
But nothing after accepting.
Okay hangouts.
Revelation looks good.
I will make coffee.
I have that applied all the time anyway because of android studio.
I will restart and disable onboard audio.
I will call on hangouts.
Actually, no.
Setting up the server.
No idea where it is storing its data.
Discord.
You call.
Try that (no https)
lost.host
Call here.
Nothing.
I am trying to connect.
I showed me server stats, but did not connect.
I am stumped about why I can not connect.
Ports are open on the server.
64738
Disabled the server firewall and still I can not connect.
Maybe you are using ipv6.
I will clear all the data in my data folder.
I deleted it apparently.
Is this not a new yay feature?
That is an electron app.
#6289
This is my discord tag.
Add me as a friend.
Yeah it called me suspicious.
Send me your one.
Wait I think I know.
add `discord#6289`
Jeez the server file is 200MiB
The discord tab is telling me it is recording and playing audio.
It looks like the control channel is working because I can see the stats.
I got it none.
Yeah, I made one a long time ago but it is not foss.
#6289
Did you forget to take the earplugs?
How are you?
I like it better when you say hello in the morning.
But then I remembered the reason.
Yeah.
I am home.
It is pretty expensive though.
Hmmm.
Can we get a hologram calling machine?
I still never saw anything.
Just found this in my config folder.
Oh wow.
Oh early.
Give me time updates then.
I enabled it.
I do not want the game auto syncing.
It looked weird.
Where are you?
Are you home?
It was raining today.
.config/gtk-4.0/
Hi.
Did you get floss yet?
Yeah, but when?
When will you leave?
Good morning.
Did you sleep?
Yeah, I was confused why I said ewww too.
I just did 3 interviews in a row :/
Did you eat?
Are you always in Hla's room now?
This kind of reminds me of your mum.
Nada's toes are so sharp.
And 20 years in the future.
It is too late for anything.
Also, get a better cleaner.
What will we eat?
Hey wake up.
Oh wow.
Okay come celebrate with me.
The other minecraft related thing I was interested in was minesaga.
Why not.
Okay.
I bought more bitengen.
Are you wearing a dress?
That does not sound like a dress.
Hurry and play some bed chess with me.
Oh.
Ewwww.
You will have to think back to remember it yourself.
No.
THANKS
But I really feel like being home.
I am not exactly bored at work.
Is there a somewhat professional looking photo of me with a light background?
Also, crazy's neck is fine.
Like at the round about.
Maybe this monday.
Will we hangout?
I am super hungry.
I will be eating in celebration of hunger.
I need coffee.
**Pay attention**
There are loads of interviews today and HR is skiving.
Today, our place.
That is the one they have, but low resolution.
Hmmm, been in a fried eggplant phase.
I am not sure, I just checked the photo you sent of her, I think the top color is similar.
Pretty sure gtk4 is not released.
I mean an official 4.0 release.
The symbol for gram is g.
It still seems way too fast.
What should I have?
We got dove finally, but that can not be why there is a celebration.
A skyblock type server, with mining overworlds, pvp sections, custom server side mod stuff, economy.
Am I unfocusing.
No.
Could you close firefox on my computer?
The sun today was so dim on the horizon the edges were so sharp.
Of the sun.
I should make scones.
Oh I am so glad to be home and you are here.
When you tell her a joke, does she go, "hlahlahla"
Yeah.
Good morning.
Are you finished now?
Yeah, the border control are really cracking down on it.
Did you ram people out of the way?
That is impossible.
Will we hangout today?
:(
Hmmm.
Peanuts.
Will we go for food?
Are you feeling wonky?
I am not used to hearing fromyou until 5pm.
Minya android, system analyst.
Where is your not quite a dress photo?
deep fat friend with corriander and salt on.
Should have had eggplant.
DId you go shopping for a hologram machine?
I SMELL BREAKFAST
Hi.
Do you want to go?
Because if you drink a lot of it something is meant to happen.
I need to top up on hummous too.
I was, this moment, thinking of messaging you to tell you to be here.
But with your face.
I want toast with spread.
What is the going street price now?
Do you have to give them a secret passphrase and then they get it from a safe under the counter?
"The wind is awful northern today"
There is no extra material under focus.
No idea why but the budget service was not enabled.
3 never feels warm.
I am at work.
I do not know why.
How are you?
And Hla really grew up fast.
Are you home yet.
Who was your dealer?
I am going to ask every day.
Which file?
There are auto mining bots for example, and cobble generators make random ores.
Tired.
18 hours in a row gone is too much.
Just finished coffee, getting dressed now.
*To me
That was a busy day.
Where is the hummous?
I need to get some more.
Eugh
Toast for all the good spreads, toast for all the bad spreads.
Eugh is it home time yet.
I will say, as soon as your parents go out, ring ring ring.
Nope.
I will go home.
I am home.
I might go home now.
Okay let me check.
No spread; no bread.
Be scared that you will not sleep enough and that you have to get up and go out.
Be scared of potholes in the road.
I have not felt much since I found out about my grand mother.
I have so few people active in my life.
I drank it all.
It is after 10:15 each day.
But I feel like beshomel tonight.
Will you bring orange juice?
Or any really small ones.
Are you home.
Also, comprimised once, no trust ever again.
Oh you are at home.
My pendrive.
Prepare for city stars?
Only my document folder, your computer is weird.
Tomorrow is hummous day.
The life motto I live by.
Be scared of the sun burning your skin.
I remember everything about the day adrian left.
I am back to forgetting about it.
I will have some chamomile.
Is she in the chess club yet?
And beshamel.
I think they are about to.
Okay it is back.
Hahahahahaha.
I wonder if the database is online.
I can make an alias to your email address.
The sd fits in it.
Your computer requires you to unlock the keyring on the actual computer when I try to connect to it.
Did you teach the types of pasta lesson yet?
Be scared of the inflation rate.
Be scared of trap music.
Be scared of adding too much salt to a meal.
I never helped my sister with any studying.
I wonder if they stored data securely.
Okay shutting down.
Hello.
Why do you feel weird.
It tastes like margarine, but with the milky taste replaced with a sunflower seedy taste, but nicer than a sunflower seed taste.
Why am I so tired.
Oh that is my least favourite borrtex song.
Can you wait 30 minutes?
Baguettes are bread.
And I have never had any other person I know die.
And I think there is no way they will ever go.
The car journey to the airport and the last time I saw them.
I remember the song we were singing in the car.
And if anyone eats her queen, she can kick them out of the club.
Did yo check all the packaged ones?
And when I am at home, I am just bored.
If there is macaroni.
What?
I am looking at it.
When you use a unique email, you can just get rid of that email address, and no spam for you.
Uploading an apk, packing up and coming.
Gourmet Egypt had robinsons juice.
English money...?
The fancy place in the huge shopping centre.
Be scared you have to drive so far.
Macaroni.
I do not think about it.
What is Hla's favourite subject?
11:30.
Unless they deployed completely new servers, they can not trust their server.
Because emails are never secured on servers.
So your email will be in the public now.
Gourmet Egypt had Robinsons.
I could not believe it.
I just need the vegan spread now.
I finished the tub of hummous.
Oh, she threw up the first time too.
Giving her the medicine.
Oh.
How are you? How do you feel?
Did you have your pasta?
I did not send anything.
I do not know.
It is so hard to believe how many things are just gone and stuck forever in the past.
Is the OVH site down...?
Yeah.
There is a big meeting with a potential client I have to attend :(
Their server was compromised.
And if they used the same password on any other services, change all of them.
And you also know which company leaked your email.
I am here too.
And grown without shell pumpkin seeds.
2.27gbp for a litre.
A diluting juice.
I have no idea where to even look for fins.
Well you know what I will expect.
sweater jumper, jesus.
I am going to gourmet egypt for the hummous.
Be scared of dropping your phone and cracking the screen.
Be scared of plaque build ups in hard to clean areas that cause irreversible tooth decay.
But with really thin tube pasta.
These are all number one best friends who are gone.
I was so sad but I could not show anything.
She can be the founder.
When I am at work this week I really want to be home.
I always arrive around that time now.
It was fine.
They are being irresponsible by not telling people what data was exposed, and what people should do. What they have done to stop it happening again, etc.
I already made the alias.
What list?
We can tulipe around the clock.
I got three hummouses and baby corn too.
Oh wow, how long is he going for?
Crazy is trying to fit inside my backpack.
That is not a bumbag, it is a fannypack.
Miniskirt is the only type of skirt I have heard of.
Was the pasta a prop?
Nope, stop being scared of that.
Be scared of your laptop breaking at any time.
And usually people leave me all the time.
I have been very sad in the past about people who are gone.
And number twos: alex macrobert and liam findlay.
Are you sure?
You got them from the big bags though.
We should probably book soon.
I had to talk to people from Iraq :/
Wait.
I got two fruit and barley oranges for 56egp each.
Calls.
I am off on wednesday which makes my long day tomorrow.
Be scared of Hla and her army tendencies.
Be scared of mold forming on food you do not want to eat yet.
I feel like maybe beshomel.
But now I have only three people.
I can think about the past and all the times I spent with these people during huge phases of my life and I get so sad.
But now I am crying :(
I have been a bit ill the last few days.
Did the api server just stop responding?
They should switch to Uber probably.
You should change your email on it to careem@lost.host
I can show you how to save passwords, a little more difficult these days.
But when I am home.
Hmmmm, I think you can not.
Hmmmmmmmm. It will be hot, but I want it to be bright, and not to get home and feel like the day is over.
Be scared that you do not find a tasty food in time when you are hungry.
Be scared of people who take photos of themselves in public.
Christopher jardin, david firth, stuart ruthven, christopher jennings, jack summers, jack goy, adrian brannen-jurgenson.
It is the only time I heard the song.
I usually do not talk to you around that time.
And all I have had is breakfast yesterday and today.
Yeah, it was 40 minutes.
I will come home in 30 minutes though.
I just found a shop selling robison's juice.
56egp for a litre.
I did.
I got two.
How are you feeling?
Only waited 4 hours for it to download today.
I could not believe it.
Yes.
It is the only good juice.
The special flavours are 80.
No, just the best flavour. Orange and barley.
I am having my coffee.
Where are you?
It can not be asking each other for help.
21st of May he arrives.
The first time I had to cycle in lightning
The cats are freaking with the rain.
You probably do not.
Not yet.
Or the winny the pooh one?
I want those on the list.
I have three whole days to sleep and do nothing.
And found these ruins.
I asked at work, but no one has any.
Last year we search everywhere for swimming shorts around this time and they did not exist.
People from Cairo I think would never buy fins, they only have the nile.
But you said at first you did feel weird, and I think this did affect
Unless Hla threatened me.
I used to have this stupid joke with someone.
They would say I am Hungary.
Every time I see the words I am hungry, I think I am Turkey. But it makes no sense because it is hungry and not Hungary.
Yes, a few times.
Did you finish it all yet?
I really love the voice actor in it.
Good morning.
There are detailed player security controls for your island.
I do not really want to play if you are not there.
How much is it there?
She is having a bad reaction to one of them.
In general, or right now?
Oh it is such a busy day.
I am waiting to go home.
But we talk about libraries, and things.
Thunder and lightning and heavy rain.
I will have it now.
Are you home yet?
This has always been the case.
I will not it happen.
This is three or four weeks in a row.
Why is toka not home yet.
I remember you said Nada would take it.
Was the playlist fine.
Vanillaish but a lot of server side mods.
It is also in a separate world.
I sent my self their phone number.
I expect it to be expensive though.
A bit bored.
That was always the riot rule anyway.
But in scotland it would rain for days non-stop.
You might not, but I maybe overthink things that mean nothing.
Nope.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
I had koshary :/
I am so tired.
I think I will play a video and lay down.
I believe you do not want or mean to treat me different.
No, I have been to Turkey.
I had koshary today.
Yeah we just watched the episode.
It tastes like sunflower, or soy.
Sometimes I think that would explain a lot.
Good morning.
I am at work.
I think they would just rent them when they go on their holidays.
I do not like speaking to many people, but you are fine, and you are welcome on riot.lost.host :D
The weather.
**ROBINSON'S**
I hope the power does not go off.
It is just a pint.
Let. I will not let it happen.
I love you.
And I would say I am Turkey.
We should just stop.
Is the weeeeekend heeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
IT IS TUESDAY MY DUUUDES
Heliopolis: 3 Dr. Hassan Aflaaton St.Tel: 418-0118They offer diving courses and they give PADI and NAUI certificates. They also organize trips and are considered one of the main importers of diving equipment in Egypt.
Okay now I want to go home.
Well yeah, it is boring.
What will you do today?
I just had to cycle home in rain and lightning.
I am so scared that you treat me different these days.
Before when I asked to see you or call, it felt normal.
But now I feel like it might be perceived differently.
A tub, yes.
how you interacted.
You are the university.
The rain is kind of heavy.
I think it is better if I said this worry.
There is not much I want taken out this time.
Not a surprise really.
I can not find any good ones.
You just used the tall glasses and never drank the juice.
Oh wow.
I finished eating.
It worries me that any changes are caused by changes in how you feel.
But I will not look for them now.
I say no, but I get hungry and they convince me.
Why do I know learn my lesson.
Probably.
Probably in an hour or two.
There are always real stores on Minecraft servers that big.
You had the pooh one too but you never used it.
Living it large with hummous and robinson's.
I am watching What Remains of Edith Finch.
Cobble gens as random ores.
I think it is not just sky block though, there are other worlds.
Try it before me then.
Maybe /is create
Thunder for two days now.
For me, opening 20 tabs of youtube loaded better than using the reddit embedded videos.
Baaaby.
Can you call?
Tell her t oimshe
Oh I want the mr happy and mrs giggles cup too.
Mmmmmmmmmmm hummous.
Forests are so much better than beaches.
My stomach always gets sore.
You can disable visitors.
I think we and team up and use the same island.
Toka says it is hailstoning at work.
Here.
I wonder if anyone has caught rain going upwards.
31% done.
The peep show.
I got home wetter than crazy's chin.
Kareem left and I upgraded to 16GiB of ram at work :D
Do you have my tiger cup?
My cup here is rubbish.
I am excited for hummous.
I feel the first week was normal, and between after that and now is a similar period of something.
And a forest next to a beach is even better.
Toka came home and I fell.
You can buy spawners and auto selling chests and auto miners.
Should I boot arch?
discord
I will sleep, eat hummous, drink robinsons, watch videos, and be bored.
I went on an adventure along the coast one day.
They have forests, so good.
I think I have photos of this day.
It reminds me a lot of the Gone Home voice actor.
Can you disable chat?
Rain and thunder again.
Fine.
You have seen the us office, right?
Does not exist for me.
Only an up and down vote.
But it was very sunny and very hilly and foresty.
It is always a mistake.
I guess it goes coocoo.
There were floods in a part of cairo yesterday.
I will try minesaga today.
And falling to the void places you back on the island.
Try /is , maybe it lists the commands.
The graphics are pretty ugly in general.
It is hailing aparrently.
I can not afford to load every embedded video on youtubehaiku.
And quite long.
Baaaby.
I have almost finished all three tubs of hummous.
I made a command that securely gets all my secure files and config files on a new computer.
And it is so so much smoother.
**NOICE**
A server with over a thousand active players.
Every player gets an island an zone to produce and sell.
Okay.
Okay one moment.
The weather.
Hailstones at toka's work.
Why?
That is thunder again.
What no hummous is my favourite.
Which is a set of commands and a key but encrypted.
Look at that error, am I sleepy.
Do you still have your own room?
Thunder.
You have issues.
European.
2 pin round.
Lisa knows which one.
Oh rain just started.
Where do you want to go?
You can go to the hummous shop.
Yeah, it is just odd.
I have no idea actually.
We are going for a cycle.
Oh yeah.
It is something like /istland create first.
I know there are a lot of commands.
Such a waste of hummous.
Watch westworld.
The peep show is good.
There have been already.
Could you take one of my cups over?
There are no fun games to play :(
I am trying to resist ordering computer parts :D
I want to finish it now.
I had to compile stepmania to make it work on this operating system.
What no, the cleaner does cleaning.
It is all command based.
and `/is go` to warp to it.
Ill?
What do you suspect?
If reddit does not revert its design, I think I will stop using it.
They completely redid their design.
It does not stop buffering the last one.
I also have no idea how to collapse a thread anymore.
I never press it so I never realised.
They are compatible though.
He got a mortgage, right?
Are you moving in with him?
One might even say you are calm o' mile.
As long as you can still type commands.
Hailing...
It much be cold up in the sky
Just skip the day.
Hi.
Beginning.
It is toka's day off today and she does not want to do anything.
I am serious.
Pass
Mr Moneypants.
Just watch a recap video on youtube.
It has just become too slow on 2Mb/s.
69%
83%
Where are you.
Toka said hail too.
I still find it funny that the cats sleep under the blanket.
Actually, my least used key also has that problem.
Yeah, a longish weekend.
But I prefer gopass
I just found out the pi zero has a kernel module that allows ethernet over the usb power cable.
Oh wow, look at him.
Wow.
The large thumbnails take too long to load.
And when I click pause, and move to the next video.
A whole category wiped.
~/.steam/steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/run.sh /path/to/executable
It has been for ages.
There is still a bump at the actuation point, but the sound is gone.
Not in a danger sense, in a do not leave here sense.
I am moving onto the cashews.
There is only a windows version on gazelle.
I have no phone.
Of course.
And it will get all my files from a git repository using ssh to lost.host and set them all up.
Weekend your ass home.
Does she live in London, or is it nation wide?
Hello.
Just going to try it out.
You are so lazy.
Yeah, not moving far.
Yes.
Safer to just say data.
19%?
Will you send you.
I have time every day apart from thursday and monday to play.
Maybe, I am thinking about it.
curl, openssl, ssh, gunzip, and sh are on pretty much every computer.
Oh wow, the click in my space bar just stopped.
Wake up.
The power is going off all the time today.
Wait until you have merge conflicts with nothing but carriage returns.
Would you cycle to university?
Is it his 11th property?
I am having cake.
I am awake.
I never remember to set downloads at night.
I always hated that if I wanted to reinstall my operating system, or start on a new computer, I had to copy all the files I needed to get started on a pen drive.
Pokemon cards should be illegal in Belgium too.
Having baby corn today.
It is an aur package on arch.
Detached, living the life.
I am making bitengen, fool and baby sweetcorn.
Do you explore a lot?
Why are you happy? Your project is tomorrow.
Will this picture replace your current profile picture?
I am thinking about going to bed.
Reading for university?
And my alarm clock died.
For two hours?
I am making it now.
Are you here.
What did you get?
I got a power cut.
I am here.
Hahaha
Where is it?
Actually no, unless you have mobile data and are safe.
Shit.
Did you just wake up?
I woke up at 12.
But witch distribution do you want to use?
Do you have an external drive to back everything up to?
:/
And the distance.
Eugh the union jack pillow.
I am okay.
I think you should burn them all.
You must really enjoy walking.
I like it better.
Remind me tonight to reboot and start the download.
I forgot to.
I will.
I could help you jump into the deep end and switch to a tiling window manager.
How are you?
Oh you took the car.
Did you take too much Crunchy?
I am on an eating spree.
Oh wow.
Well, I find all graphical stuff broken and slow.
15-20 days right?
Around the place we went looking for poppy.
4G in a house is 100MiB/s.
And have the laptop.
Are you camping out?
The police will think you are hacking.
Yes.
It will take about 6 hours.
I think I said 10-15 by mistake.
How are you today?
It is just sitting in the work fridge.
It is a sealed small jar.
You get so calm from just walking a mile.
Where are you going?
Today is just a special day.
It is finally home time.
Hi.
Today when I passed Ali, he was by himself, with no customers.
Which divides the screen in a grid, but if there would be a gap, it would expand the master window into the gap.
Your face looks happy.
Is it in Arabic?
Is it a steam only job?
I have still not had coffee.
Toka is off today.
Linux is just the kernel.
There are many many different user interfaces.
Yeah.
When is it over.
This is too pink.
Did you submit the project.
Will you have crunchy?
The power went out. No idea how far it got.
I will start it again when I leave for work.
Was I too odd?
I wondered if you made friends with people who have few friends too.
If they had something to tell someone, and if it were random who they chose, the more friends they have, the lower the chance it is you they will communicate with.
I expect that you have a new project straight away.
And maybe a silent playthrough of Gone Home.
Jesus, I forgot to restart.
Why...?
Although, everyone hated it when it came out, and a lot of people worked on forks of gnome 2.
If you want to keep windows, it gets way more risky.
So I expect them to destroy the disk.
Thursday is her off day.
And a pen drive or sd card to make the installer.
Is it over now?
I mean not on purpose.
Yes, I wanted to stop and have breakfast.
I am thinking we rename crazyeyes to wetchin.
Also, gnome uses about 1GiB of ram to do nothing.
Do you still paint?
I was waiting for you to get wetchin.
Oh my head hurts too.
Are you home.
No, not really.
I use dwm and it has almost no interface. It just tiles windows automatically.
I can call if you can.
Does Aya have lots of friends?
Did you sleep?
I ate.
I remember last night I went to bed because the power went out.
Did you switch to linux already?
................
You should always backup your files.
A flash drive to make the installer.
Usually these fancy installers will automate it all, but I never trust them.
I bet she did not even check the forecast.
There is a fly pissing me off.
What is Hla doing to the car?
Wait, maybe.
Oh no I would have to reboot. One moment.
I am back.
Like Ben, he has not friends other than me.
Probably.
The power has been going off a lot these last few days.
Yes, I will eat soon.
Wake up.
I am home.
I am home.
I forgot the sauce.
I think it is pathetic they can control people after they are an adult.
Have I been too negative or groggy today?
He has a wet chin.
What do you mean by tonight?
Do you feel any more stable?
It sounds like you lost a pie, to me.
Yeah, that would be 15 days.
*Snooze*
I finished watching What Remains of Edith Finch.
Yes.
This morning I forgot to restart before going to work.
I hope you are fine.
When I have one window, if it is not full screen, I am wasting space.
Gnome 3 is the most popular desktop environment.
Xfce4 is a more sane desktop.
Why would you want to?
I am sitting here with a can of raid.
Yes.
I can talk at work.
It is fine.
I have had a lot of cake.
I am having cashews again.
I find that if my friend has many friends, they do not pay enough attention to me.
Happy 1111.
Maybe if you can find a silent playthrough.
It is quiet without kareem though.
I doubt we will get a replacement.
Hi.
I hope you are happy.
Floating windows is what you are familiar with.
Especially before changing the disk structure.
They do not tell you exactly what they will do.
Your old laptop?
A central processing unit?
A tower computer.
You can install both on your laptop, but I would not trust you to do it alone.
She has to look after her own children, and her own house, but wants you to help her.
Okay.
He has crazy eyes.
Hi.
Now?
I bet Aya has cashews for breakfast.
I am so hungry.
It is the only time I have seen it.
It makes no sense to have windows behind other ones, and it is a waste of time resizing and moving them.
And the weather is not a good reason at all.
I did.
I feel sore.
Did you finish cleaning it?
What are the other people doing?
No.
Why are you sad.
I am home in 455 minutes.
I just get distracted and forget.
I have 5 minutes to finish my coffee.
Hold on, I have to go to work.
A cheaper minya worker.
I have been meaning to take my hot sauce home from work for a week.
Fedora uses Gnome 3 I think.
I use dwm.
I use it with the "gapless grid" layout
Are you confused?
I can usually kill them just by hitting them.
Why in a bit?
Crazyeyes -> wetchin
I went back to bed and stayed off today.
I have thought about it before, but I have never seen anyone do it.
I just felt pointless.
I would bin uncovered stuff, or stuff that is going off.
But floating windows are just annoying.
There is also another big suite of desktop stuff: KDE.
Are you home yet?
I miss the times we met.
Why.
But this one is a troll.
It is still alive.
My stomach hurts a bit.
There are too many.
Nope, but we will, very soon.
I just want more hummous.
A bit boring.
Waiting for it to land on my foot or something.
I get ready in 30 minutes, I leave in 45 minutes.
Where outside?
It kept flying on her face.
Will you bring noodles.
Is Elgin football club not the worst place to pick?
Nah, they go after nothing.
No.
I felt too sad.
No, you did not pie for anything, you steal pies.
No the next day we are free.
The cat was trying to eat a fly.
They might not agree on a place to go.
A cool down over the day I suppose.
One day you will paint your masterpiece.
30 minutes.
That sounds like a made up definition.
Cells are dying from the moment you exist.
Hello.
A bit better.
I did.
Better not bring up the divorce at the reception. It might shatter her.
It was Eslam's idea.
I have my headphones with me today.
Did you just pie me?
When you are robbing someone do you flash cash in their face so they understand what you want?
I might have porridge.
Are you outside my door?.
My head hurts.
Tomorrow is a long work day.
Goodnight Mariak.
Oh you have no money.
We had last wednesday off.
Well, he was on the fence.
I will have special cake.
The pooltop.
I will soon be out of it.
Yes.
My plan is to get it tonight.
I think our cable is so long though that it would make things worse.
Radwa who?
If you called 55 minutes ago.
I presume the login package is pretty independent.
Coffee will do.
**This is a pun**
I said no, but I might do a long day tomorrow.
No it is not that one, it is a major one in the center.
Do you remember this song?
Angela the one we looked after?
That room is full of talkers and productiveness.
Where did you go.
It is here.
What did you do today?
Hey come back.
Magdy wanted me to work today for a dead line tomorrow.
Where are you going?
That sound suspicious.
My mouth.
I rejected it.
Eww wallets.
Rude.
I guess not.
Welcome, to the world.
I am too hungry to resist.
I will go home soon.
It makes me hungry.
The people left the place we got it from, and the new people did not give us enough.
The water man came, it was 115.
What does this mean for me?
Where did you go?
I think I will take a shower.
A bit.
It is Edith Finch speaking.
Today is just bad.
I came in today and Magdy decided to replace our room with a meeting/interview room.
Their only reason was to shut down a room and save the cost of AC.
Jesus.
Eww gigs.
You can tell her to play chess.
Koshary is coming.
I would insist the decision made before leaving the house.
I have not eaten all day.
I will sleep.
Did you know Jamie was getting married?
There is no way I will accept any compromise here.
But I am very stubborn and now everyone moved back.
They had no logic.
I have no idea.
Why is it never Nada?
I slept a lot.
What is the third one?
Wake up.
Who are they?
And put us all in the giant loud common room.
Hmmm, maybe I can find the post.
What would you like to achieve today, Mariam?
I am just making the release build.
It was super hot today.
Good morning.
We will take crazy to the vet.
I had a piece.
I am fine.
I have fool.
How did she even get mummy's address?
Tedata switched all their packages to VDSL
We have tomorrow off :D
All I said was it would be ironic if we had to work labour day.
Now we wait for them to figure it out.
I bet Aya has her own pool.
Calls do not work here.
We do not know yet.
And I am going home soon.
What were you returning?
What is wrong with Nada?
What did you have?
Do you have the laptop in the pool?
Just out of it.
Are you home.
Normal, but mega for the potential.
The line reports stupid low attenuation, I think it is an error.
Good if we are within 2km, otherwise bad.
I have a holiday tomorrow.
Stepmania and videos.
Did you finish both my orange juices?
I ate a lot.
Do you guys speak?
We need to set up red alert tonight.
Okay.
I would force you to wave every day.
So I think we should be there before midday.
For it to be accepted.
Okay hold on.
With the robot.
Tell her to make her own chess board from cardboard.
Why have I not had coffee yet.
I had the coffee.
The thing is super cleaned.
We got him a hamster like water bottle.
I will heat up the fool.
Oh.
It is way way too hot.
How important is a low ping for it?
But not many people are here on average.
The meeting is Sunday so better.
Also, it was meant to be at midday, not 10am, I forgot about the timezones.
Are you fine and alive?
The tooltip.
But I just thought about food.
I might be getting that broad back.
DId you sleep?
Our ISP finally upgraded to VDSL2.
How does she know I cycle?
Yes, I am.
If he is not thirsty.
Do you not have your own pool?
European servers?
Our work will switch from 8Mb/s to 100Mb/s tough.
Toka said she messaged her on instagram and told her.
Nothing yet.
Oh no, but yes I will eat everything now.
Oh no, I almost never do now.
I am at work.
Real beshamel?
Do you have an outgoing transaction on your list?
I reason it should be accept, but I expect denied.
So I got the spray.
Oh I need to reboot for that, hold on.
Noodles?
Okay.
But early weekend :D
Radwa saw me cycling to work today.
It is the last day of the week and the police might say the system is down.
Nope not yet.
Suuuuure.
And looked under the dishes and trays.
Toll
He left last week.
Careem.
No, I only spat on him.
No, she is at work.
Okay.
It is roasting hot this week.
It is tempting.
She she have spy binoculars?
I never saw her.
Nothing went in.
Yeah.
It looked like a slightly bigger insect just gave birth to thousands.
I just want lots of water.
100Mb/s **tough**.
None of that weak ass soft 100Mb/s.
He has two lines 8Mb/s each.
Maybe 10 people.
Where are you.
The Irish visa has been decided.
I will wait a while.
I am going home now.
**HANGMAN**
Tomorrow is also the police station day, and toka's parents day.
Oh I will check when I am home.
Can you imagine you lived en-route to my work.
We need to get another spray though.
Tell me when you are close.
But toka's are not because she has classes and no substitutes.
Is your favourite food broad beans?
Beshamel and red sauce.
Make it happen.
I locked the cats in the other room for now.
What are you doing?
I will have a think. If there is anything it will just be little things.
Download what?
They were released unfinished, and then the content was sold as dlc.
Egyptians are pretty white too.
<3
She said she lives at the traffic lights I pass every day.
We should be at the embassy at 2pm.
Come meet me.
Say I have a lactose allergy or something and you picked the wrong ones.
We will not appeal, but we will complain.
It is almost my weekend.
I should leave soon hopefully.
We have to go get the result tomorrow.
Something like that, yes.
The bathroom floor had hundreds of little insects.
There had to be almost 750 insects under the food tray.
When are you home?
They are so bare and lacking content.
I imagine everyone there will be.
I can take about a week off.
Mmmmm toast.
That is probably for the best.
It is refused.
They had the marriage certificate.
I am home.
+100
Tell them to turboclean.
It is 8.8GiB.
I saw the stand for those balls.
The stand outside that sells the balls.
Amany's cousin took your seat.
I am going to bed right now, a long day tomorrow.
Are you meant to drive on your medication?
We are off to get the visa result.
Between 2:30 and 3pm we can get it.
We need the cleaner.
I sprayed everything and the corridor.
It is _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ my dudes.
It is W E D N E S D A Y my dudes.
Okay.
And with all the dlc, it is humungous.
It will be fine then, and we should be there before you I hope.
This, in a torrent client like qBitTorrent.
**ILLEGAL**
A mum who makes special cake is probably not that special.
It is too early.
Try a mood destabilizer.
I have been since 8.
Which is stupidly narrow.
Because they outsource the work to UAE workers.
I think the amount of egp we currently have is around 1,200gbp worth.
Asda and sainsburies are merging.
My work hours and days can be pretty flexible.
What food.
No.
Yes.
Are you trying to find ways to distract her?
Nope, just broad ones.
No, you are the missing one.
I woke up.
I do not recommend the new ones.
How can that be allowed to happen.
Did you find it?
No.
Also, check the back of the other packet before.
Even 12 seems a bit early.
DId you sleep.
They just refuse all of them.
Rejection had no reason at all.
To south Korea.
What do you want?
Did you just leave?
Look at this.
Which is just horseshit.
And tell them to refuse them.
Will you move in with Lisa?
I lived alone for two months and it gets weird.
That seems dangerous.
18 fucking months.
We will form a complaint with all the violations and evidence and see what the European commission say and do.
I will make beshamel.
It is just broad back cake.
They are straight up liars.
Failed to prove they qualify.
Living alone is too dangerous.
They broke so many laws.
Anyway, south Korea gogogog
Not home until tonight, so I will check when I get home.
There are auto litter trays too.
Passport is done.
No cost to appeal, but we have no trust.
Oh you mean the passport.
Yeah.
Later this year.
You will have to find someone to live with.
You could litter train them and get them auto feeders.
She said Monday.
You could fall or get sick and not be able to get to a phone.
It was rejected.
It is fine.
Will you be here this evening?
That is my sort code.
What are you now?
I mean the holiday there.
We picked it up from the embassy.
It is roasting hot.
What will happen with the pets?
That is my sort code.
Oh wow, I just looked at the clock and it is still early.
But really I feel just fine.
I showered but the boiler would not start so it was cold.
What are you doing when Lisa moves out?
Be like, "you can not quit... Because you are fired."
When will you finally be here?
I am Paul the tiger and I feel greeeeeat.
You went to be yesterday at midnight because schedule, but you just woke up.
Well.
Will you move to a smaller house?
But we will speak later.
What the hell.
Hi.
No I will not accept it.
Send the article?
Spoilers, jeez.
Okay.
You should kick Lisa out.
Oh.
What do they have to say?
The cleaners have to keep all the doors and windows shut.
But what if Lisa is working at the same time.
I am finally home.
Aterriblescheduler
I am turky.
Is it the standard form factor?
100W cpu.
But I am uncomfortable over 80 on full load.
I really wish steam would run on this distro.
So I ran out to the balcony and took him inside.
He could have died.
What is your plan for today?
It is.
Jesus, does it have amd graphics?
This intel amd graphics cooperation is weird.
Tomorrow is my day off, so I really want it to download tonight.
By that time, I would be so tired I would justify skipping it though.
I ran through to the balcony and took him inside.
Okay breakfast man came.
He jumped up to the ledge.
After my coffee.
Probably worth watching the whole thing when you get time.
Yes, you always say you are sorry, but you are Mariam.
This looks like a german work.
No no no today is over.
That thing must have a crazy fan.
I mean, it is mostly just the gpu using that power, but still.
My nuc costs the same as my ram + storage.
I think a piece of paper in front of me.
I will tell you when I can play.
I went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet.
You should redact that message.
I hope so.
Okay.
I have nothing but orange & barley and coffee now.
About 100-110 is the safe limit for intel cpus these days.
What is in the smoothie?
Oh this look not like a hifi speaker.
You should ignore me when it comes to speaker or earphones or headphones though.
Why is your laptop shut?
I need hummous.
This is too much sleep.
It was 25 and I gave him another 5.
I will.
Like they have never thought for a second why mesh exists on windows.
Did Hla play the sims?
It was such a long day.
What do you have?
I think I have nothing.
Oh, I remember that article.
This thing would be a pretty good console.
I am trying to figure the best method of making sure I do not forget.
I rebooted and started it.
I saw possibly the scariest thing.
Breakfast was 25 but I added 5.
Okay now time to put the fan on 5 and do nothing.
...
Crazy had to jump from a railing and quite far to that ledge.
He is the crazy electric guy.
I just look too old.
It is too expensive.
It took two hours on three buses to get to the embassy.
How dare you unliterally die.
No no no have something else.
Is this unreleased?
They throttle themselves to stop hitting higher temperatures.
Tonight.
I put the cream on crazy.
It is installed.
Good morning.
I was on the toilet doing a poo.
Then crazy appeared at the window.
He did a jump from the railing to the window, and it is not that short.
I was trapped in the clothes room.
Why is there uneaten cake in the fridge.
The cleaners open all the doors and windows and let the cats out and flies in.
I will do the washing.
I am so full now.
And I will not buy something I can not afford upfront.
Jesus.
Why is your chamomile not drunken.
We could try ordering.
Yeah they just did.
Yeah mohammed just rang the door.
The cleaners came.
Movie and game when you come home.
Then I saw crazy in the bathroom window.
Look who is in the exact same situation as us.
The phones sims is a micro-transaction based game.
Now?
I had rice yesterday.
Aaaaand if it fits and you have space, my chess board and set, but I doubt you will.
What new one?
We can book it online.
Did he kidnap the best ted speakers just for you?
All worth buying speakers look like this.
Why are you not wearing your glasses.
I did it.
Not yet.
It is specific and derogatory.
Delete it.
They did.
The cleaners should just close things.
Our windows have meshes on them, but they open the mesh too.
Will you send you?
No one should.
He has wanted me to play it for the last week.
Oh wow.
Hot hot hot
I did it.
What did you do?
I would rather buy a computer.
When will you be home?
Earphones are probably the thing I spent most money on in my life.
Water and fuel look the same.
I need more robinson's too.
Finishing my coffee, doing the clothes washing, nothing, nothing, nothing, when toka comes home watching "You Were Never Really Here", then playing a game called "Swords of DItto"
Kids should not play games with any pay to win or microtransaction elements.
Yeah but give me 10 minutes.
I will play Insurgency with Ben.
Do you have any sugestings?
I forgot to eat the fool.
The spare stuff.
Be here today.
Yours.
I barely ever get new things.
It depends on the sun though.
Where do you want to go at night?
The only new things I would like are a tub of pure soya spread, two tubs of vitalie sunflower spread and one or two super concentrate Robinson's black currant juice.
There are two cups at mummy's I want over.
I am okayish.
Did you have mcvities digestives?
What happened with my mum last time?
Read the terms.
Why did we not book the 23rd.
You have the 24th off too?
I say they come to cairo after the 25th.
Okay. I will.
Oh thanks.
I have fans.
Wake up.
Are you okayish?
I think I will try the glib version of void linux.
You can contact them directly when confirming.
How can you trust a currency that the government do not trust.
That should be exciting.
We can not squeeze all that in before you go back to work.
Just for a day, and back in the morning.
Okay the booking is from the 20th to the 24th now.
Nah, there is never enough time to make a library here.
They are hot.
But they are too expensive to buy, and to run, for slightly better than a fan.
Are you the girl who cried storm?
And the vegan cookbook.
Do you want to just book it?
Well no.
Yesterday I just took a break.
Small.
No, they arrive late that day.
Yes.
Yeah.
Where are you.
You did want to go out.
Did you manage to contact the cozy little studio person?
We have a booking from the 19th to the 22nd.
But in a much cheaper place outside of el gouna.
Which is a bit crazy.
I should do some internet shopping :D
Could you find my vegan cookbook too?
Yeah, it just crashed for me.
It has to be independent.
My current idea is to change the booking to finish on the 24th.
Here, magdy came late and has breakfast.
Good morning.
I feel a bit lacking sleep.
Oh wow.
My favourites are the gnu v3 and the ISC.
Or, just do it at a later date.
It will come with a readme file.
Free...?
I am not.
Toka has to, including, the 24th.
20th night, 21st night, 22nd night, 23rd night.
Just after 6.
Javadoc can be generated.
They always have the latest versions of everything.
Does it have any important data?
You go out too much.
Remember to get blueberries.
At 100egp a ticket for foreigners and 10egp for locals, that is 60 million foreign visitors just to repay that loan.
And about 150 million foreigners to repay the construction cost.
I feel in between.
Partially open.
Okay good.
Oh.
I think I did not manage to sleep enough. I did not want to get up.
Oh oh I am turkey.
Local currency USD...?
What will you do today?
Tried this but it crashed.
It takes forever for the intial sync too.
Or we can go back together on the 22nd.
But the only day overlap we have in elgouna is the 22nd.
Okay.
Classic apache?
Ubuntu is not a good development platform though.
It will be slow, but it lets you experiment easily.
One is the install disk, and one is the drive it will be installed to.
I have no idea.
Or a text file with instructions.
I just do not trust they will not mess up the booking in real life.
That is not an advantage.
Egyptian citizens are required to pay in the local currency.
We booked two nights for when daddy comes today.
Yeah.
Are you working the 23rd?
If you can get the 25th off, they sleep at ours, we go the next day to the museum and pyramids.
They go home at night.
That is the one.
How are you?
Sorry for work talk, but mahdara, is it on your harddrive?
Yeah, they are markdown files.
Lulu sells them.
All foreign guests must pay in a foreign currency, by law.
Wow, the government are so weak.
Trying it on my work computer now.
Hot but hot here.
I have no idea.
Then you come to cairo just for a night at some point.
I would say change the book to the 20th to the 24th.
Although I am not.
The same time as weekdays.
I leave for work at 11:15am each day.
I need to, but I am bad at buying things.
Yeah, I used that one before.
It is a bit far for my bike.
(I have no idea what is public information)
Why does it have windows on it.
They just overbooked or something and she could not stay there.
Book it.
I think because it downloads all the images recently to display them in the terminal.
We can split up the trip so you come to cairo after we leave on the 24th.
They go to elgouna.
Oh second breakfast.
I have not woke up that late since university.
There is not too much difference between a lot of them.
Sometimes I use atom if I am working on code at the same time.
stackedit.io is a nice online markdown editor.
README.md
Okay we will check when the latest buses are.
You need two pen drives to do it.
They taste more coarse.
As long as I am somewhat on call, like always.
15 minutes I suppose.
No we return the night of the 24th, we have nowhere to sleep the night of the 24th.
I wake up at 10am.
In the winter I have to come earlier so I am not cycling in the dark.
You could come back on the 24th, sleep at ours (or stay in downtown), and then we could set off early in the morning of the 25th to the pyramids, then to the museum, and at night a bus back to El gouna.
Oh, yeah.
Hey.
But you will want at least 16GiB total.
4GiB for the pen drive.
It might just be me being wrong.
I have to be at work at 9am tomorrow.
I am home.
It says this month.
I wonder why.
I watched a review and it looks good.
I did it.
Not as good as fresh, but not as bad as canned.
Holidays are savings.
**FUCKING GUESS**
Yeah, people started coming later and later.
Half old projects, half helping new projects, half server work, half every other problem.
stackedit was better though.
I mean the time of day.
Did you see the image support, it is freaky.
Probably 4-6 GiB after install.
Rolling release models work much better for developement.
Ubuntu does not provide rolling releases, because ubuntu is based on Debian, and they are basically the same.
You could just install linux to a pen drive.
Did you go out today?
Honestly.
The little packets, but they are different.
We booked just outside el gouna from the 20th to the 24th.
So the alarm should be 7:30 :/
They cost an extra 5gbp to see.
Yes.
Everything is back and working.
Which license will you use?
I use Markdown language to write most text, and mostly in neovim.
It is not my place to disclose company information.
Yeah but I never use these sites.
When would you want to leave on the 26th?
I will leave very soon.
Did you shop until you drawped?
Did
Right, I am off to switch to void.
I am switching distro, so me not being here is expected.
Where are you...
And I saw focus.
And looked around and saw focus.
So I woke up, put clothes on and cycled to work at mega speed.
A new chip too.
My main problem is auto mounting them on the clients.
Sshfs is fine up to about 80MiB/s I think.
Hi.
This is not lousy.
Hmm, maybe.
Or is the git version from 7 months ago the newest?
First I have heard of that.
I get bored and switch all the time.
**QUINTUPLE???*
Guess who I saw.
Things are hectic.
I did find the application on the play store though.
It was removed for not having a privacy policy.
Pretty sure he will be keeping it as a suprise.
But ubuntu upgrades every six months.
Usually recipes change for different cultures.
Yeah, it was rescheduled last time.
Hi.
You never sent you.
Then you will feel wonderful.
I have to go to work early tomorrow.
And she was going to a koisk.
I have had breakfast but I still need coffee, so I am not awake yet.
Oh no.
I think it is one of the best.
It is too hot.
Are you glad Ireland did not work.
Magdy is okay with those dates.
I got home a bit ago.
How do you feel?
300 million usd loan from japan for it.
There are (well there were) mummies in the main museum.
Who said yes?
Did you draw until you shrop?
you see this?
Did you play the new Pray?
Where are you.
I made it just in time.
The meeting was good.
Good morning.
Okay breakfast time.
I was only there for a moment.
That is true.
This morning my alarm went off late and there was a huge meeting with a company abroad.
This will be because of the GDPR.
All the technical proposals and such.
Actually, I do not know the date, someone said the 7th.
I am more selfish.
I booked my days off.
Did you draw and shop?
What?
But yeah, nothing to do with the original.
It is like exploring for me.
They have jarred hummous, it is okay.
There is another one later.
How are you?
I was like what the hell.
I would rather not do them.
But I am okay at doing them.
It feels like I have been at this company a long time.
Oh this is early.
Yes.
Maybe for you.
About 350 for us.
And the weather.
I would not want you leaving the same city as me at all.
I only bought the biscuits once, it is too far to go.
They taste different.
Okay.
I will eat air.
Rent is paid.
I went for bread in amr's new car.
She never saw me.
Well, my wife's alarm never went off.
Lisa must not realise.
Never.
The pi zero is actually my favourite currently.
Power, and ethernet over the same usb cable.
I do not use it for media. I just use it as an emergency os.
Depends on your cpu I suppose.
Will you come on the 8th for money?
This was amr messaging me this morning at those times.
Is it a woman?
We should check flight prices and pick the cheaper of those two then.
But I am fine.
Qwop praying.
Savings.
I am still here.
Yeah that was a while ago.
They got a sales guy a long time ago.
Because I was meant to be there at 9am.
You can get a really fancy place to stay for not too much.
This is a year ago when Soha left the company.
I looked younger I think.
21st of may.
Buy all the hummous.
Hummungous.
Wait I weighed them first and it was 1.5kg.
We can find out.
If you have questions regarding potential noodle scenarios, the answer is yes.
I will install void linux.
Remember to photo when you go.
Photo your first blueberry.
amralyy9:18 AMPaulamralyy profile imageamralyy9:34 AMOh My God , we are all got fucked<br />amralyy profile imageamralyy9:52 AMIam fucked
nfs or samba?
Yeah, I still do.
Not really.
Any after may :D
I mean to south korea.
Oh yes, they look red.
It is too closed.
lib64/libstdc++
Asmaa
Sorry sometimes I see  a message and have to leave for work then there is no notification.
It is also not a priority.
No no.
Actually, we should probably go over all the applications and add one before they get removed :/
And I have to help with the English and meetings.
My stomach really hurts.
And it is used heavily in mvvm.
Where is mummy off to?
We will all stay in one apartment, so I suppose there would be quite a saving there.
Do I make a lot of jokes?
Are you talking about to sleep?
There is no food.
I arrived 5 minutes before it started.
This is nothing but good.
Oh it feels like longer than that now.
Our colors are matching.
Well, anko makes it not that necessary.
Did you make an alarm?
lib/libstdc++
Do you have any idea how hot I am.
I cycled at megaspeed.
Hommous party at 8pm.
Do we want 2.25kg of washing powder for 25egp?
It is so bright and colourful.
Can they sing?
Two.
I am guessing it will cost me and toka about 1,400gbp.
South korea is very very closely related to the USA.
But you do not look sad.
Is the mug big?
I had a super important meeting with people in Iraq today at 10am.
So I had to be there at 9am.
It was arabic practice.
I have no freedom when a guest is over.
He can go get his own balcony.
I had nothing since 11.
Are you still at the same company?
The cheapest month probably.
The USA occupied it for a long time.
I think there is a gourmet egypt near you.
Because liquid is concentrated.
Yes.
No, it is not starting.
I am making porridge.
No of course not.
Oh wow.
Yeah it runs too much stuff.
There are 8 generations of i7 processors.
Shhhh
And it feels like you have been gone a very long time.
Oh wow I never saw this.
No, java too.
Egyptians have visa on arrival, like us.
This is the best photo, not one of the best.
Why?
My smile looks crazy.
Mariam.
They have quite a few shops.
I switched it from 18:18:34:30 to 18:18:30:34
I am not sure you make any jokes.
Come over where?
Where?
But you can install xfce4 on any distribution.
For it to install xfce4 automatically, you have to use the local installation, not a network one.
They make you use a laptop......................?
Which is ultra low power.
But there is a console tui installer.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hahaha
Check for the new museum.
Soha sent this since it has been a year since she left.
Toka woke me up at 9:30.
Did you get blueberries.
We need to get food tomorrow.
Okay it should be working.
Why would that have to be in our house?
If I wake up, I will not sleep until he is gone.
For what period?
I like ubuntu for servers though.
Oh we are meant to go to the police station today :/
You want a workstation.
It is U though.
Hend did not need 12.
I am hoooooome.
Yeah it is okay.
By herself?
It is not dangerous at all.
But with a crazy smile.
I made it 5 minutes before.
Okay stay calm.
Wait a moment.
What do you mean, again?
I tried release models, but I really really prefer rolling release.
But it have very little maintenance server wise.
No.
i7 means nothing these days.
lscpu
I think that is a full xfce4 install, yes.
It is pretty classical.
Did you start that drawing?
What did you sketch?
Nah. I found robinson's diluting juice.
It was to match the clothes.
And then found messages from the other guy in the meeting of sheer panic and terror.
What do you call it when you buy all the hummous?
They tried too hard so I took three bags.
Hey come back.
Yeah.
Short day tomorrow :D
Why would he want to be at this house?
I just made some porridge.
I like it so far.
I have no idea if there is a graphical installer, I doubt it.
Or created from your head?
I can never draw hands and feet.
That sounds like a middle man.
Do you make jokes?
Are you there?
Do not add it until I adjust the rates.
HAhah approach someone.
I switched to void linux.
Not until you have tested it at home and know how to setup android studio.
You had 6 sticks.
So does baroody.
These are terrible.
If you want the latest android studio on it, use a flatpak is my advice.
Yes.
Hey.
Just say the dates when you figure it out.
We should order.
So the jar gets 34%.
Without date things, it is usual.
Or hummous, mmmmm hoummouous.
The glib variant.
Morning.
But always make backups before partitioning a disk.
Do not use it for work yet.
This computer has a Xeon E5620.
Which at the time, was quite a beast.
I have 16 now :D
A bit too much work and not enough work time though.
No idea.
We could put all three bags in one mega wash and have the strongest smelling clothes of all time.
Did you tell Asmaa that I saw her?
Good morning.
Gnome 3 uses about 1GiB of ram to do nothing.
If you really want an interface, use xfce4.
And many many different powers in each generation.
6th engeration.
Preferably.
I am fine.
Yeah okay.
I thought you were on the way back.
:D
Laptops are toys, they are not for working.
It is not that bad of a cpu though.
Yeah, not enough.
Well, I want better monitors.
It is copied from real life?
When do you want to stay?
Hmmmm.
Which is how you know it is a low power laptop.
I actually traded yours with amr for a different stick.
Thank you for always being here.
Have you never been to the UK?
We are making special muffins.
I am home.
The market I think.
Need to go food shopping today.
City stars is too far.
Eeeugh.
Oh wow.
...........................
Drugs must have the biggest number of middlemen of all things.
Hey you never used news.lost.host
Remember we talked about it.
Did I forget what.
The way I had to do my first 3ds was the smash wifi method.
No, it is all local.
It is using at least 170MiB of ram.
The balance said 0.
But this is not a replacement to breakfast.
Yeah if you are here before 6.
There was breakfast.
On the couch I think.
Under a pillow.
I am hooome.
My residence permit is done.
But then I forgot it is restricted to my vpn.
Total fees 522 what?
Old people in the UK get free bus travel.
What is this?
All software is moving to subscription based.
It was a bit crazy.
I just use the free and open source pokemon bank.
I have one worth 1.58gbp.
The only game I played online was mariokart.
I think I just saw a bug.
I said I would try a bit of it yesterday.
My stomach hurts.
It is disgusting.
I opened it up.
Do you remember the password?
You will have to search.
Toka is off to finish the thing at the police station.
It says total.
Yeah.
I need cooffffeeeeeeee.
Is the traffic bad?
What is the level system?
I think there is mention of young people getting free rail travel in Europe soon.
Love you.
I am awake.
I am making it.
I mean, I have not checked it in about a year.
Did you just spend the rest of your money on a birthday present for nada?
Oh wrong month.
It is just rice.
Hmmm.
A big one, yeah.
I am here.
Rss.
Oh no, I watched it.
Steam will also not let me sell those collectables without verifying a phone device.
Runs python probably.
I am scared it is ma2looba in an hour.
My stomach hurts after the malooba.
Any idea where they would be?
5th from the left first row.
No, but I should check amazon.
What does the period of stay 14/4/201 mean?
The residence is finished now.
Oh survival.
I takes like 5 minutes now.
And what would I take it in?
With little bits of dead animal still in it.
What film did you see?
Oh yeah.
It sounds like something she would pick.
I am now.
Okay keyboard is getting unplugged.
I do not want to eat food that is laced with dead animal.
I am not sure about that.
Hello Ms Mariam.
...
I am so so so hungry.
I have heartburn from the malooba.
Yeah me neither.
Yeah I am following it.
Nothing new there.
blonde
They already do with pokemon bank.
Oh the whole process took about 6-7 hours waiting for dumps.
Averaging about 3% cpu, with spikes up to 50%.
No there was 12 people eating it.
I have the residence permit now.
I compiled stepmania on alpine linux and I was surprised with how smooth the framerate was.
Hey wake up.
Be inside for the whole day today.
Or next thursday.
I do 6.5 hour days 5 times a week.
A bit tired.
I forgot my dove this morning :(
It is just save backups?
I will be pissed if there is no breakfast.
I think it is fine.
I push it with the number of days I have off.
Was it not hacked quite a while ago?
Look how much this chat program has to do.
When I send a message it spikes.
I am talking server side here.
As in a spoon.
No.
It is not mine.
I am too hungry.
It is full of meat.
Not work.
What are you?
Was it a liquid?
Or those sachets.
I can.
I finally got my residence permit today.
Yeah it was rude.
He never gave me an excuse either.
It felt like you never left.
No one called wally in my class.
Toka thought it was 3rd from the right.
Toka wants to see my class now.
I am home.
Oh wow.
Tomorrow is going to be a mega high day.
And where?
Not in the next three days.
I am too exhausted to do anything after work.
A bit hot.
They are so big compared to our cats.
I am curious to see if you think I am still as white.
No I had them.
I just compiled it on void and it is janky.
Tomorrow is thursday.
The only difference is the c library.
Some pretty crazy changes in android studio 3.2 c14.
It is never too late to be the morning.
I like to look back at the code when I first arrived here and see how much better the code is now.
Just no idea where they are.
What are you talking about?
The navigation screen with jetpack.
Jetpack seems to be a new name that encompasses all the android stuff they make that does not come with android.
Other than this.
App bundles too.
I should wait until the start of june before I mention more time off though.
How are you?
Yeah.
I am going to have to install 3.2 c 14 to check this navigation stuff out.
I quite like this guy.
He really hates them.
Maybe if I switch my long day to tuesday next week, and after work on wednesday we meet.
And it is not that interesting.
It is all renamed.
When?
Next friday maybe.
I am going to south korea this year too for two weeks.
I also do not like the dark much.
Wednesday is a work day for both of you right?
When do you both finish work?
Show me on a map where you work.
I think there is not enough work to stay late today.
I think this is the middle of the triangle we work.
I think you both work pretty close, right?
Baaaby.
What about here?
The person we are renting the apartment from phoned toka this morning to confirm everything.
I arrive later.
I think the issue is fixed though.
I just felt sweat drop from my arm pit.
Maybe, the AC has not been on today though.
I finish at about 6 these days.
Are you home yet.
18 hours straight.
Actually, I am hungry.
And mmmmmmm IT IS WEDNESDAY MY DUDES
The fool is much better today.
Wow, rude.
Fine 20 will do.
After a download finishes.
Are you home.
I want to go home now.
...
Yeah that was crazy.
Why were yo awake at 6am.
I got paid.
I am home.
Okay, I will check in a bit.
I am so hungry.
You better tell me about new android stuff as soon as you hear about it from the IO.
I did write a recursive neural network, but it made me realise it is just all matrix operations.
And when you use a library to make models for you, it is just data collection and processing.
I am home.
It is about data and maths.
The internet is very very slow until then.
Why would you not?
On canary 14 up.
No.
This reminds me of Of Monsters and Men.
But we are off tomorrow.
So yalla hurry and finish.
What are you?
Oh let me check.
Yeah nothing went in.
Do you have a record of it going out?
Hi.
I am melting too.
We have a game to play.
All day tomorrow.
No, I am waiting to find magdy to tell him I will leave.
Going to check in about 55 minutes.
Are you hungry?
I am switching operating system again.
# Thanks LISA
They left.
That guy was the CEO of google...
single-Activity app the preferred architecture.
I am waiting for them to release room 2, or a replacement to gradle, or android studio native.
I hope there are more surprises.
I think we will meet you when you arrive.
You know, the thing that gets me is firefox scrolling also lags sometimes.
Maybe void compile all their software without much optimization options.
Makes me tempted to try gentoo again :/
Okay.
I was thinking noodles.
Are you excited for breakfast and mega high day?
You better be rfha.
Gentoo.
Or seen each other.
Yeah it went in.
androidx
We have not voiced chatted in a while.
It will auto convert your code to it.
Ben is too negative about everything to enjoy speaking to these days :(
I am fine.
I am so scared.
I am thinking all the terrible things.
I told him I do not have a phone.
They are breaking the wall.
He did the same for the zelda dungeons.
But with a commentary, and much shorter.
I want to do nothing.
No, why?
They guard told me to phone her.
So he gave me his phone.
I did not know the number.
I have no idea what to do.
What did he want?
Wow.
Me I suppose.
Did you do anything yesterday?
I watched all of that video.
Most of it is listing every single moon.
Mathewmattois is still the best though.
The videos are clearly not aimed at people who want to know in a minute why it is bad or good.
They are not even for people to know if they should play the game.
They go through all the content.
Letsplays are casual commentary and the full game.
-
`-`
Can we talk by email today?
Come in.
He asked me to call you.
They are gone.
They do a little.
I think that is everything.
I am hot and hungry.
Are you off today?
Everything is vdsl2 now.
It is no longer asdl2 plus.
The amount of noise in our cable is so high vdsl2 would not work at all.
I would rather not watch a lets play of someone playing no man's sky.
It just came.
Hello.
Today?
Hmmm.
I plumber is here.
I am fully expecting him to just leave the wall fucked.
The metro is meant to rise to 4egp by the end of the year.
No one has time or room to check.
I told him I do not know her number.
What will you do today?
He had your number.
They are destroying our kitchen wall.
I expected them to leave it a mess, but he filled it all in and cleaned up the rubble.
They left it fine.
What are all those weird ones?
Oh wow.
I thought, damn this bin man is never going to give up.
I might check amazon today.
It is the weekend so I am fine.
Ours usually sleep above our heads.
No, I have the mario pieces here.
There is a new wifi-standard for indoor positioning.
Will you send you.
A mouse, a mouse pad, the tiny pi zero case, and two tiny cables.
We just need to book the bus.
The website has switched to all the new packages.
Which makes me think there is a problem with the cable.
Hmm, not too heavy, just very large.
Maybe I could find one to buy here.
I would tell him to stop driving and walk off.
Toka thinks we should just buy the stuff there.
I am home.
Toka ordered me surprise breakfast.
I was ignoring the door bell because I, because that is what I do.
But they never gave up and it was breakfast.
Love you.
How are you?
I keep thinking about if I lost you and I get upset.
Are you here?
Some leak inside a wall going downstairs.
I have no idea, and I do not want to deal with these people now.
No, she is at the pyramids with her class.
I hope they do not come back.
He just said not to use the water today.
I need a lot of coffee.
So why did he ask me to type the number...
Why was it weird.
Do we call tedata and ask about the new packages?
No.
I have never failed so much in baking something.
Love you.
I got rid of the scones.
No, but I added baking powder.
Two months ago, I did not speak to Ben for a month because he annoyed me.
No, I am just anxious.
Packing up now.
Yeah I expected so.
It is just a new name for a bunch of existing libraries.
The flies are going to kill me.
Why have I not had coffee yet.
Oh it disnae land.
I wish showers made you feel better.
I am finally making coffee.
What are you finally doing?
Oh wow.
Lemon and lime, and apple and blackcurrant are good.
That is enough.
They will think it is drugs with that many.
Yeah, they last quite a while.
But strawberry and watermelon sounds gross.
You would be surprised.
But I did not want to risk the size.
Did you mop the floor?
It is 150-180egp or 7-8gbp.
At 1 egp it could never have made money.
Yeah, but they switched protocols.
The piano.
I really miss my piano.
GPS is just the US version.
I failed.
:(
He it too negative to enjoy speaking to.
The scones were terrible.
I am just too anxious.
I want to go home.
Straight from giza?
I did not have coffee until 5, and I did 4 huge poos.
Toka found it funny.
I do not know, some insecticide.
The number of things I have seen with cats now.
Prolapsing had to be the worst.
It went on for months.
I am at work.
There is but now that I cooled down, it is not hot enough for it.
I have no jumper if it gets too cold.
4 items should arrive on the 15th of may.
Yeah, I placed the order.
Mouse, mouse pad, pi zero case, two tiny usb cables.
You saw them yourself this morning?
One way.
The price of the metro went from 1egp to 7egp in the last year.
*4egp
Not at the time, I do now.
Why did you not get something to kill it?
Tok toks are terrible.
Hahaha.
But some people must of thought, traffic is bad, encourage metro, traffic a bit better.
And now the government things, losing money, try to make money, not making money, sell it.
The AC is on now.
The pieces would need to come too.
I am hooooooome.
They are in the oven.
They are soft and about 800C.
Because there is no scones.
Or all * 200?
I should get the mouse.
Let me calculate.
Jesus.
I cut my hand in 7 places before I noticed.
Oh wow, they did not work at all.
And the last time I met Mariam was bad.
So now it feels like you and Mariam are the only people left.
I do not mention anything.
We will book that together.
I think it is a 6-7 hour drive.
Also, camera permissions.
I will not risk it after that disaster.
But it all failed.
Or add a new function if you need to break the old on.
I am at work.
I will buy hummous today.
I was tempted to get a much bigger mouse pad that fits the keyboard as well.
But there is a bus every 35 minutes to elgouna on the near road.
You just phone them and ask what speed our line can handle.
The piece set you got with the big board.
I am not sure. Maybe.
I really failed.
They just never cooked right and they tasted like
My head hurts though.
Is that not a day early?
everyone claps at a mockup.
A text view has a lot of functionality that people do not realize.
So they think a textview is as simple as rendering text on a canvas.
Then it should be in that package.
If you are going to do it, you need to make it a stable api.
The first nine stops will cost EGP 3 while an additional EGP 2 will be added for seven more stations (totaling to EGP 5). A full line of stations, from start to finish, will cost a maximum fare of EGP 7.
They can not enforce that.
The press statement also cited accumulated losses worth EGP 618.6 million as well as an outstanding deficit of 94 percent in the maintenance and renovation budgets of 2016/17 and 2017/18.
So increase the prices and take out 10 billion egp for a single museum.
I am concerned because vsdl2 does not help if our line is really that long.
But they never check, and never fix it.
But if we switch to vdsl, they might be forced to fix it.
It did not fit in any suitcase I had.
I expect it will be too big and heavy.
If you can fit my keyboard too, that would be great.
Phones these days come with many backends for positioning.
That was fast.
Should I make scones?
I am making scones.
The jar of fat was too sharp.
Did I miss something...?
Maybe they are just chocolate chipless cookies.
Ordered a new computer mouse that should arrive on the 15th of May at mummy's.
Is that what you mean?
My scones are not rising.
In a way you would never see.
You can just speak for yu.
I never noticed the heat yet.
Waiting for C15
It is a pain in the ass to keep working with all the apps at the same time.
7 min plus I think.
He just collects money.
I got hummous and robinsons and hobnobs.
What?
Are you hungry?
Only if it fits.
Bored.
Is this a way for google to steal images to create more realistic 3d maps...?
The solution to the problem she mentioned in the beginning is a compas.
I got a new song pack for step mania.
I am fine.
It has been a long long time since I saw someone use gps to find a way.
But if it is used application wide, stick it in the top package.
Hi.
And I just don't want him knowing anything about us.
I have no trust in him.
flour, fat, sugar, baking power, salt.
Will you bring juice?
Okay.
This last 30 minutes is taking forever.
An interface is a general thing, so it should be under the scope in which things use it.
And the only public functions, have guarantees to stay the same.
He does nothing, he is the worst landlord.
bluuueberrrries
He seems like a person who wants to be a double agent.
No, no liquid.
# TRASH
2 * 100?
Which one?
Where are you?
Jesus there feels like a lot of money in the jar.
You never wash your hair.
No, I thought back, and this applies to too long of a period.
And I am scared of losing any more.
Our buses there are booked, we should arrive at 2:30pm.
My dad arrives the 21st, right?
Baby.
I think I will have a muffin.
Where are you.
"Here is what it **could** look like in google maps"
So I disposed of them.
No.
I am home.
Will you bring noodles.
Hahaha fady.
Nope, not had a chance yet.
It is a known bug.
Because everything is public by default.
In Java everything is package local by default.
What is it?
He is negative about everything.
Good morning.
What date is that bus booked for?
Maybe.
Kotlin deminished the use of packages to folders.
Databinding can observe live data.
The building is entirely the land lord's responsibility.
He gets free money and he can not pay to keep his assets intact.
Has she ever been?
Too late.
It is not.
Am I what?
And hungry.
Did you eat?
People still just ask people.
If you make a Shape interface that is only ever used in a ui package called shape.
A core app?
Absolute cunt.
He seems manipulative.
And on crack.
Feels super soon now.
Only works in the day time.
Buy a phone with a magnetometer in, if you care about walking directions.
Oh no.
You can see them.
I had peanuts and corn.
The pagination library on android is complex because everything is more complex than when you first think about it.
But a new feature from android has to account for every feature of a textview.
Jetpack is nothing new.
I installed it here and tried to update to androidx.
Yeah.
Have a look at where the android interfaces belong.
Water and gas stuff is also.
Good morning.
And dependence on your brother is not something I want to tease.
Sucking up to each side.
I should leave very soon.
I am trying to finish something first though.
One day your brother will turn to you and say, remember all those times you relied on me?
3, maybe 4 of the items should arrive tomorrow.
Yeah, only three more days of work for me.
I expect an initial test.
I expect it to be much harder.
Also, it usually cost the company more to hire from abroad.
It has been so long since I last snorkeled.
I got four hummous tubs, two robinson's, and hobnobs.
Yeah we need to download them all.
How big is the mouse pad compared to the mouse and your hand?
Yeah.
It came and I ate and now I will go home.
I am at 135 days on duolingo now.
They were so bad.
Bread flour is something like 12% protein, and cake flour is 3-5%.
I forgot to turn up the volume at the beginning so you might have to turn it full blast.
In the uk the company need a special license.
It is the flour I think.
Only one more workday.
Yes.
But I think if you apply for enough jobs, you eventually get one.
The mouse arrived, right?
photopohtos.
Yeah the long johns I got here are rubbish.
Where are the blueberries.
I am scared to even try again.
Which makes the bread more stretchy.
Those young violent cats.
They arrived yesterday.
I can get robinsons here.
Kappy Hareem.
I am still at work :/
I hope it is clean.
Okay but not today.
Which is after my father.
Did you go?
Be7ebik.
You can take it apart to save on space.
Everything can be unpackaged too.
After the 26th.
Royal mail said they delivered it at 9:01am.
Uh I need hummous.
How big is it in your hand?
To clarify, I need the things inside the plastic bag too.
Long johns, do I have ones to take over?
The cups will need to be wrapped well.
I wish I had an extra 4 hours to have a nap each day.
Where are you.
Yeah that is everything.
Hello.
My head really hurts.
Amr ordered a surprise.
I think the spread is more important.
Yeah.
I showed you that last year.
No that is all.
Oh wow that went small.
They ordered koshary.
I am home.
Oh, it takes a little while to get fast and confident doing it.
I mean they are all using windows so what can you expect.
On wave-terms.
The things I ordered: a new mouse, mousepad, two tiny cables, and a tiny case for my tiny computer.
Yeah, I think so.
Pfft, gitkraken is for when you do not know how to use git.
Well this page looks unreadable.
Monday.
I think.
I wonder if it works in a view model.
Yes there is.
The back of it though.
Not the usual eye spot.
I am home.
I think I will watch a video and almost sleep.
But only for code watching and searching.
They would not allow people to make broken copies.
What are we doing.
I feel so sleepy.
What...?
I took my headphones but keep forgetting to listen to music.
I just got home.
I use sourcegraph now.
Which is the latest I have done in years.
I took a muscle relaxant and I think I am getting drowsy.
Everything arrived.
Seems alright.
Did anything come with the mouse in the box?
Yeah I need that plastic bag, but not anything else.
Wake up.
I am waiting for koshary.
I hope it comes soon because I want to go home.
*The Bri2ish class is gowing splendid my deary*
How do you feel?
I feel excited for juice.
No.
The people of egypt do not realize flour has different types.
# 135 CONTIGUOUS DAYS
Good morning.
Oh wow.
Yeah.
Oh no, I do not meet people.
I need juice.
# WESTWORLD
Why am I awake.
Git is still perfect for everything else.
Also, I expect it to be ridden with security bugs hidden behind their closed wall.
The os is just shit.
What I really want is flutter with kotlin.
The cycling shorts fixed the problem with my legs completely.
I have cycled 2000km now.
Baaby.
Maybe broad bean mash stuff.
Mummy has everything packed ready for you now.
It is super soon now.
At least one spread.
Too much work to do before el gouna.
Servers will all shut down the second I get on the bus.
Where are you.
Are you out?
Shit I just remembered we have to watch
Is it still as good as the beginning?
But I bought tougher tires and new tubes and I have not had any problems since.
I have had the same with many pages. Not recently though.
Webservices then.
I can not wait to try livedata in a databinding.
I doubt it.
Westworld is just eh.
Dart is just kind of like a modified Java.
But Dart sucks.
My head still hurts. My back hurts. My neck hurts.
My stomach is huge, it is embarrassing.
I had three punctures from the roads so far.
Toka's parents.
I woke up at 12:30 today.
Which is the latest I have woke up in over two years.
I was not lazy yesterday.
I was shocked about how bad it was.
Good morning.
I was not tired, and stayed up to 4am, then I was in bed but felt like I could never fall asleep.
Hmmm.
It is devastating when X crashes.
week
Even if it were, it would not be free and open source.
Going to toka's parents right now.
Yeah.
I have been on 1 coffee a day for the last weak.
Hey, I did 10:30 work hours yesterday.
Which is odd.
Or submit changes without their full control.
Since people use it, I expected it to be good.
I have tried other tiling window managers, but I always come back to dwm, it is just flawless.
Quite a big download though.
Because fushia and flutter started before kotlin was released.
I doubt it.
An deal with incorrect line endings...
This became a google project.
I had to use it for a while, and it was terrible.
dwm, learn to use it.
And floating window managers are just toys.
All the database stuff is boring, but the rest is good.
Also, Room is great.
Today is catch up on Westworld day, then Toka's parent's for iftar, then home for Swords of Ditto.
I compile it for gentoo.
Black mirror is way way way better than westworld.
The strongest winds here are tiny compared to scotland.
I think you will be shocked about how bad that is too.
The weather has been a bit erratic I suppose.
Thomas cook MT302
I am awake.
Oh wow.
When is the exam?
Well, I only buy things online, so I do not really need it.
But when I travel, I suppose I will need it.
I tried to shower but the battery for the boiler is dead.
Can we have your flight numbers so we can keep track of any delays and timings?
Taizadine.
Are you overdosing on therapy?
I woke up.
Is it muffin time.
How are you?
I woke up at 12:30.
Yeah he is.
Yeah.
We should be at Arena Inn waiting for you unless there are crazy delays.
I am off to Toka's parents so I will be back later.
I would be to afraid to let someone touch me.
Too
Are you fine?
Mashy and salad and some other things.
I have no idea when you went.
The medicine yesterday made me sleep early, then I woke up at 11.
But I am off today so I feel good right now.
I think I will be.
I wonder what I will have tonight.
Is it tamarind?
So I do not have the sticky ones, and the dry ones I check the inside first.
I think we never had hard ones in the UK.
And they burn your throat less.
Any food?
The temperature is meant to measured in the shade.
When are they over?
Did you hear the message?
D battery.
passports
Id
I do not think so.
I switched to the hard ones when I came here.
It is if you spend the day outside though.
Are you here.
Not sure.
I mean in Egypt. My Christmas present.
Yeah you said when it was arriving.
What are you doing?
My head still hurts.
Oh oh oh I have a week off.
At at no point did he make an actual plan or offer.
It is just weird.
So from this it seemed like he offered to pay when I brought up money issues. But just for me.
I suppose he did pay the first year of rent too.
Yeah, I think that.
Logs are there.
I have one more work day until my holiday.
Oh now you are sending me Tom Day on the ambient channel.
A role reversal.
Oh a voice.
Oh no.
No no it will be full of little pyramid sets and sphinx models.
We will go down a day earlier though.
7:15am localtime.
Have you been there?
It will be the first time I will have new photos.
Also, when I do take it, I think I do not take enough.
Wait what time is it...?
I am taking robinsons.
They are less messy.
No.
As long as he has my mouse and juice I do not care.
It is weird you would like about this now.
This is too far away.
I have cycled over 2000km now in Egypt.
Oh, the clock here is correct.
The bow
Oh everyone has gone home.
Or at least I never bought them.
It took forever.
You can pay me back. Toka can help out.
When are you setting out?
Allergies I think.
My head really hurts.
Oh.
You are going for sandles?
I am paranoid about finding worms in them
Yeah okay.
Direct sunlight feels like an oven.
We arrived. The flat is really nice and has everything.
We went to Nubia hotel and ate there. Pretty expensive though.
Lie
Did you hear the message?
I am playing multiplayer stardew valley with toka.
I wish I took my headphones.
I only do on the long days.
I think you always do fine.
I wonder if I am still whiter than my dad.
Nope.
It is good. I wonder if it is him singing.
But it is jonsi.
Good morning.
I know nothing about them.
My head hurts.
What is tamr?
Where are you going now?
I thought it was behind.
The flat is nice.
Will you message when you are at the airports?
I am home.
Oh RealFeel, whatever that is.
I am knackered.
Oh I did notice there was a central booking agency.
Logs
Check Facebook messanger.
10:30pm tuesday.
We will go and wait at his resort for him to arrive.
Tomorrow night he might leave.
My backpack is tiny so it is awkward.
We will leave at 6:15am tomorrow.
Oh wow.
*in ages
Hi.
I am not eating.
Marriage certificate
Money.
Bank card
And coffee.
Everyone went home.
I am home.
I am finished work!
I shaved.
It is not so hot.
45 in cairo on tuesday :D
Crazy was like, "Where the living fuck is that food going?"
Do they allow guests?
I have not packed yet.
I will have mega noodles.
Why do yo not have dates all year round?
sufficient?
I will head home.
Just finished work.
You will be fine with a fan.
RealFeel - gas mark 4.
Yeah as a surprise when we booked arena Inn maybe.
I never said no because he never offered anything.
At no point ever did we say no.
It is cheating though.
Here is Irena's flat.
In a resort about 4km from el gouna.
Hababy.
No, he never said anything. He just said when and where he was staying.
Nah we are in bed sleeping now.
We are off to the bank in hurghada and then going to the pool.
Waiting in the bank now.
What is holibobs?
# El Gouna Checklist## Toka* Bank card* Id* Phone## Paul* ~~Clothes~~* ~~Tweezers~~* ~~Earplugs~~* ~~Floss~~* ~~Razor~~* ~~Camera charger~~* ~~SD card~~* ~~Plug Adapter~~* Coffee* Keyboard + cable## Common* Hash???* Tissues* Camera* Marriage certificate* Passports* Money* Bus tickets
Us too.
Should be there soon.
On the bus right now.
Toka's phone.
We are there.
We went to Nubia hotel and ate there. Pretty expensive though.
You are staying the night there, right?
We looked it up and it was crazy expensive so we booked a cheaper place.
But we never did.
It is weird he would make things up.
Especially when we all talk to each other and there are lots of everything said.
Toka sent a message sent to her at the end of September last year.
He either lives in a world of his own that does not match reality or he really does think he can lie without being caught.
Yeah that was in Greece, right?
You are still paying for our south Korea right?
Then no idea. Explore a little.
WAKEY WAKEY
Oh I need to use sun block.
Tiba resort is the name.
The search results are not loading.
Breakfast time :D
Mosquito heaven here.
Leaving to go to him now.
We stayed a while and now getting transfer to another beach.
Hungry though.
No.
6 km.
He expected to be here at half ten.
Yeah I am very hungry.
Just the beach.
No he just said early.
Yeah that was in Greece, right?
They are the beds you fill with water.
Just waiting in reception.
Only new computers gets me excited.
Mummy too.
Getting money from the bank.
You need 400gbp worth right?
The mosquitoes here are crazy.
We shared it with abdelrahman.
Yeah we have plenty.
Daddy is on the plane now.
I had no idea what it was called so water bed described it well.
We have spray on.
We took a microbus to hurghada for 10p.
The pool is empty.
Still waiting.
Yeah.
It will not get fixed.
They might be hungry when they arrive.
But the tok tok took us to the wrong place. They were not there.
Okay that is done.
See you soon.
Toka can not get on the water bed.
You have no idea how much we say rude these days.
Last time I saw him cry was when Conner left.
I am never excited.
I will try.
Not yet.
No crying.
He took two spreads and all the juice I think.
Heading back now for a long sleep.
I only saw him cry once.
So 50 minutes more maximum.
They are here.
Every person we ask has a different story about mangroovy beach.
Yeah.
Or the food and drink bag.
Yeah but it is not that great.
1501715
I have so much news and videos to catch up on.
Oh the lemon and lime is good.
Did you ask om mohammed to come?
They are called air mattresses.
Water bed is not American or anything.
We are in arena Inn.
In about an hour.
Not yet.
But they are still harrassing us.
By bus about 25 mins I would say.
No one does not hate mosquitoes.
No not yet.
Yeah I got it.
That is funny.
pyramid time.
By the time we got to the museum, it was shut, because of special ramadan times.
Normal juice is 1 part juice to 3 parts water.
Took out the sd card, it turned on fine.
Yes.
Yeah we told the resort to phone us when they get back.
We went to another place and then we just went to the place we heard best reviews about.
Yeah we spent the day there then went for food and drink.
Not the toka bag yet though.
Maybe.
Here is weird and desserty and artificial.
And richy.
Tomorrow is the last day.
Long enough I think.
I do not have a computer here.
We are leaving now.
Then some guy said it was renamed to element.
They phoned and he will come down here because it sounded nice.
I might get some before bed tonight.
I will tonight.
She is still here.
The pyramids were the pyramids.
My new mouse is the best.
Which is ideal.
The mouse is brilliant.
Hmmm youssef.
I am getting very sleepy.
Oh wow.
Actually I think I can.
Also food here I think will be too much.
They said they would go to mangroovy beach in the morning.
So we went there. And they are not here.
He never used the internet at the hotel.
This place just seems like dirt with water next to it.
Did she steal it?
Yeah, everything is here but the cookbook.
He has it now.
I turned it on and off a few times and it was fine.
And expensive food and drink.
We have fly guards.
Now I am not allowed to answer the door.
Which club did you go to with the z-man?
Yeah of course.
I think he really did pack a lot for us.
Yeah I remember it.
Five minutes away.
No I think we have none.
I missed you so much.
I am too burnt.
Got the bag of goodies.
Oh the socks look brilliant.
Mug yes. There are three more mugs though.
Jesus the prices here though.
The north coast we went to is probably preferable.
Yeah I did, but snorkeling so it comes off while you are.
The sun burn made sleeping very painful.
Yeah, one more day.
Yeah daddy just forgot it that is all.
I am really really here.
I am relaxing so hard.
Double concentrated is then 1 part to 6.
I should warn you though.
She just left the back door open again.
And salt.
And the mousepad is huge.
Then a day or two in Cairo.
I am here.
I did do other things, but I think none of them would have done anything.
I had no reason in scotland not to wear all the clothes.
Like there is a Mariam inside you who wants to write different.
Which is how long she takes to clean, so what is the point.
She also left the front door open.
Oh no they are too big.
People keep knocking on the door.
She cleaned for 1:50.
The whole time or just as we were leaving?
I woke up.
Daddy is going to speak to mummy when he gets back to see if it is okay to be in the Meredithish group.
Just so everything is more direct.
So we should change it to since they joined.
It is just an expensive fast food place.
Whose car is that?
Pyramids were hot.
There is no way to confirm they are on the bus, right?
I love you.
The little bottle is the same as a 1.5l bottle of normal juice.
Only two squirts for a whole pint.
I should get lots of photos off toka's phone.
I was hidden away in the loft.
The smell of the furniture freshener is really getting to me.
My ears are all open.
I feel so restricted.
I got om mohammed to talk to them.
As I was walking back to the car I was, but I was hiding it.
Another beach, thai, and pool table game.
Just not been on the phone much.
I am not sure they would like that.
Lisa, what did you eat when you stayed?
He said you mentioned a close place like nando's.
No I do not remember right now.
Have to leave now.
Is it really poppy?
No we were at a pool place.
Now we are home.
Yeah.
Oh I will note down these details just in case.
Museum tomorrow.
Are you?
Your 3DS just started working.
Yeah.
Nope, but I will try the lemon and lime now.
They are on the bus back now.
I.
Hardeys
Well she is trying to loss weight.
Not had the funky juices yet.
It is the museum tomorrow then going outside is over.
The adapter, right?
I am so hot and burnt.
Just got home.
Finished.
This is 1 part to 100.
Am.
There are so           many                videos to watch
Well, mostly my belly.
And the normal size bottles are 1L.
All I did was verify it would not turn on.
Put the sd card back in, it worked fine.
Well el gouna was just sun sun sun.
And tok toks with well dressed 30 year olds.
I did get egyptian tickets this time for them, and the museum.
And in a weird pattern, like the shade was not even.
Do you have to wear them in your house?
But here I never wear any.
Your thos make me wonder who is slipping through.
And it just causes me to waste over an hour killing flies.
It is also a huge risk for the cats.
So 48*30.
I have a load that my dad and his partner took, but they are massive, so I need to pick and resize.
And it is too too too hot for a onesie.
What is Hla doing?
I got a zowie ec1-b
I am back at work.
Well yeah, all of these previous messages stay private.
When is it?
Exactly mahgrib?
Yeah, good.
I was a zombie because of traveling and being up early.
Only happens a couple of times a year.
It is hard to look behind but I think she saw and smiled.
I try to avoid services these days. Especially since they are so restricted.
Nah, not had the chance to yet.
It is fine.
Yeah, I fixed it.
The little computer looks nice.
Well toka likes sun sun sun and salt.
I have two tubs of sunflower spread and I am really excited to have toast tonight.
The cleaner always opens the windows open wide.
If I have to spend an hour killing flies, I could have spent that hour cleaning myself.
Did anything other than exams and studying happen with you?
But not now, not while she is here.
1:10 so far.
But it is superb.
But with everyone, right?
I just got home.
I am huuuuuuuuuungry.
Yeah the rain never lasts that long.
Mooorning.
But right now, half an hour after waking up, my head disagrees.
I got too burnt.
My legs hurt a little, and my forehead, but mostly my belly.
I guess you write different to other people.
I hope the cleaner leaves soon.
Is is Members only (since the point in time of selecting this option)
Nope, still confused.
And I mostly just write in Meredithish so you both can read it.
I NEED SPREAD
I usually get stuck with other people needing help before I leave leave.
It is second breakfast time.
How are you?
Like context.getSystemService()
I think I have that with the Budget app now.
roooooooools
I am too busy trying to get things done.
Even though I was just in water, or in the shade.
The cleaner is here right now so I have to wear the onesie.
She is here alone.
Hi.
Not yet.
Oh, that is this room.
But why change from Dagger?
It does have 1000 stars though, so someone must know why.
Iftar, right?
Are you alive today?
What if your name was Marcelle or Marcelia?
That might be my finest joke.
If you ask me to make a pancake in 5 minutes, the result will be very different to one in 15 minutes.
But that does not address the cause.
But it does seem to happen when I have certain foods.
I forgot to give you the change of the museum.
Love you too.
Because when I say something here, I do not say it to daddy too. That is twice as much typing.
Where?
I am so hungry right now.
Toka woke me up when she came home from work at midnight yesterday.
Marmillious or Mantariam.
What is wrong with you?
Just paste it.
Until tomorrow when we eat.
Last night out for breakfast it was cold and it would have been 20-28
They are too smart.
Okay.
Where are you?
You have to speak to the cleaner next time.
I have.
Either she does not change, or toka does not tell her.
Are they small cute ones without voices?
There is a cat fight outside.
What are you doing?
It was annoying not knowing if you got the bus fine.
Did you go to zahour club before?
Lemon and lime yes.
I am so so sleepy.
I was a little worried when buying it because mice have so many ways of being iffy.
The same with you and mummy.
It is always just after.
Family - Daddy, Mummy, Lisa, Paul
Meredithish would be archived.
I was just silently sad as we walked back to the car.
I do not know, I think it is safer to just create a new room.
I do not know about any plans on tuesday.
Nah, I do not stay up for that.
I am hoooooooooooome.
I waved to om mohammed walking down the street.
I will tonight.
Where is it?
But my ability to make pancakes is just fine.
I sometimes get acid reflux too.
I guess the good thing is a simple alkaline can relieve it very quickly.
I heard a lot of people say kodein is a service locator, and dagger is a dependency injector.
Hungry already.
No, it is tomorrow.
then ~/Pictures/gouna/filename.mtp
I only know one password.
# EXCITTTIINNGG
mmmmm ac
Who can read history?AnyoneMembers only (since the point in time of selecting this option)Members only (since they were invited)Members only (since they joined)
She is our cleaner and cook.
Fridge or freezer?
Yeah.
If they only paid the money for the time to produce bad code, that is their fault.
That is nothing.
They are just extensions to kotlin, that do not belong in the base library.
y
Nah, he has not noticed.
The video is very high bitrate.
This looks like javascript :(
Where is the file?
Capitals matter.
I am a bit rushed to finish some work today, but I think I can do it.
15gbp for a boat trip off to an island for the day?
It is configured in the room settings, let me check.
Oh wow.
Oh yeah, it changes so so fast, and every sdk version makes things harder.
But I have pumping jams.
Baroody got confused why I was still here.
I think I would be scared of them killing me.
Toka is excited.
Did you disable notifications.
I am hunngry.
Hmm, the use of delegates is interesting.
But do not mention anything until daddy talks to mummy.
Then half an hour later she woke me up again we a plate of breakfast.
I was so sleepy I kept falling asleep while eating.
No, but maybe I mentioned her before.
She does not cook much anymore, but she cleans once every two weeks.
And Mohamed Salah, the most famous egyptian guy, is a member of one of the teams playing.
I forgot to message before I closed everything.
You went to the beach in the thunderstorm?
Oh the huge mouse mat makes a huge difference to the comfort.
Will you get bread?
Oh no, just had more lemon and lime.
Or Marmaduke or Marmantuan.
That might be my first joke.
Yeah, I think the vital missing section of the README, is why and what the aims of the project are.
Yeah, I suppose so.
My om mohamed, or the magdsoft om mohamed?
Oh, it was the final of the champians league in the uk toka said.
If you ever got bitten by a mosquito you might become Malariam.
The important thing is knowing that it is bad code.
And android-ktx stuff is the kotlin specific versions.
Yeah it is not well documented.
I did get my app working with androidx.
Toka actually uses it daily so it feels good making changes.
Aepples and banaenaes?
I am packing up.
Yeah, definitely.
In general, right now, I am pretty good.
Not yet.
I last got it having ma2looba.
At least it keeps things fresh though.
The clients always want background stuff and it just is not possible these days.
Navigation with single activity is the new big change I am hesitant to try.
That paradigm is straight from flutter.
Come in come in.
It is freeeeezing.
Did you not turn my pc back on?
The microphone slot was different.
I get the pun though.
# DONATE OR AFRICANS WILL STARVE
ffmpeg -i input.mtp -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -preset high -profile:v main -acodec aac output.mp4 -hide_banner
Tilde
Yeah.
You work at a competing company and this code belongs to Magdy.
Too much work to do today :(
The navigation library almost looks like a training course for flutter navigation.
All the support libraries switching to version independent, semantic versioned libraries in the androidx namespace is a really good thing though.
I think last year was more exciting. I mean they had kotlin last year.
I NEED SPREAD SO MUCH
Oh it does not connect to the internet automaticall.
You could use HandBrake.
Is it working?
Open a terminal.
Also ~
Pffft suuure.
At this point everything.
I have the strawberry and watermelon.
It is not bad actually.
I was not hopeful.
I am home.
She wanted to say exactly,
I am having toast.
Come back to magdsoft; all of our apps crash all the time :D
We no longer write Java :D
A starving african who with just 5 dollars a month could live a healthy life.
Or maybe I have a command sitting around.
Try that, but replace input.mtp with your file.
What are you eeaatting?
What is for iftar?
The what?
Nah, I do not even remember my own passwords.
Hello back from the exam.
I am okay.
It is 26 in this room and I am cold.
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
So I will leave at 6 exactly maybe.
I had chips and juice.
Where are you.
I am too tired.
Hmmm.
ffmpeg -i ~/Pictures/GOUNA/00000.MTS -f mp4 -vcodec libx264 -preset slower -profile:v main -acodec aac output.mp4 -hide_banner
Do we snack on anything until ali is open?
Right.
Reviews are all good, the bad ones are not really for any good reason.
Hi.
gitlab
Apples and bananas?
Kind of reminds me of summer fruits.
I want rolls to have toast with sunflower spread.
Okay she said no.
Who is coming?
I have not went through them yet.
Where are all your pictures?
It is odd that the staff has become more to my liking over time.
Being in public makes me nervous.
I am home.
You are one good picture.
Is Hla annoying in the car?
Or maybe this pig instead of the wallet.
I can just pull off my stomach skin, it is weird.
People seemed disappointed with it because it was more like a pokemon go tie in.
That is freezing.
How long will you stay for?
Oh, that hardly seems worth the travel time.
I think if you ever worked here I could not be any happier.
It is getting too loud here now that old people are coming back for iftar.
I do not mind Baroody, Eslam, Magdy, Amr, Youssef, Hend, Hossam, Abdelrahman Sayed, and Ossama.
Apparently pooping in the sea is not normal.
The project came out at 5,000 working hours.
I got served hummous and toka got served three huge dishes.
But yeah, three days of delays because of bad weather.
The issue I see here is the onBind
Thanks.
I am so hungry.
It better hurry.
Dying.
I have not seen you since sweaty you.
Oh yeah I did, not useful for a few months though.
There is only one person I would like to leave now.
Even though I knew most of them, I just can not be around that many people.
The photo.
I do not like the weird legs though. Maybe I can juste use the face and coin.
Nah.
Good morning.
Did you get any thunder photos?
If I really got thirsty I would just go to the bathroom and drink there.
Not just easyjet.
Riot is going through a redesign.
Pulseaudio.
not much different, but at least the Cardview is not a seperate library.
Since Dart has a DSL like layout declaration, I would not be surpised if Anko became official in the future.
Do you still have the link to the malabak live design?
Good morning.
Maybe I will make a giant thumbnail preview.
And you can pick 20.
Will we meet after your exams?
I walked toka to her work after and met some of her work people, then cycled here.
Are you annoying in the car?
Do you have money?
Yeah.
Noo, it is too far.
No, not ali, or ali?
Family exams.
Uh-oh it is very loud now.
It was so so loud and busy today.
I will get dressed.
Wait.
I am knackered, it is finally my weekend.
I spent the whole day doing the Newrooz proposal and calculating work hours and budgets.
The AC is freezing so not drinking is easy. I do get a bit hungry by the end though.
I never even knew she was in London.
Hmmmm that LastAdapter looks interesting.
Navigation is like a training library for Flutter by the way.
I am starting it today.
I am staying for iftar at magdsoft today.
We could get to know each other so well.
I want to meet in a nicer place without not lots of people.
Somewhere we can buy fruits and vegetables and make a salad.
When is your break period?
But it is too loud.
I am home.
That was way way way way way too many people.
I do not want to be early.
My head hurts a lot.
# IT IS WEDNESDAY MY DUDES
I am mostly happy all the people who left did.
Okay phew they went away and left me alone.
I wanted to run away.
And the molokhaya.
I would have eaten more but toka had a class and wanted me to go to her office to meet the people.
Where are you.
Oh, a private trip is good.
I only work 1280 hours a year.
# IT IS TOAST TIME MY DUDES
Where are these photos from?
They look amazing.
You still have another 3-4 days in El gouna, right?
How deep is it out at the end?
He invited all the old employees, it was too loud and busy.
But she had a class, and a full stomach.
Also Fuel has serialization, so maybe that too.
And no viewmodels
HUNGRY
I feel like you are never here.
With two exceptions.
No one is working now.
When will you leave?
Ginger is sleep moving.
I want to meet you and soha, but I am so lazy.
A better budget icon.
Tell me when you are about to get out the car.
I am awake.
Remember to take all the photos.
The 5 hours sounds a little short though.
I finally got sliced bread and the toast is the best.
The main game is still to be announced though.
And it uses an observable list rather than the new ListAdapter class.
I would not be suprised if it was written by the same person.
A what.
Are there exams there?
Does your grandmother look like you?
The company seems pretty small these days.
Are you fine?
Nah, I was fine with the hummous :D
Ali.
Where are yo.
Where are you.
Toka came to a breakfast party yesterday at the company.
I am full of bread.
It looks exactly like mattermost/slack.
I used the MaterialCardView and MaterialButton this morning.
Yeah, I actually really do not like Dart.
It will be a gamble.
Toka is going to come too.
The other people are in the other branch and I do not really know them.
I am hungry enough for ali.
Do we go to ali.
I will sleep.
When do you go home today?
I just got home.
I only got 10 minutes on my computer this morning.
The trailer made it look like something I would play, but I wonder how much it tricked me.
Everyone at work is fasting so I have to stuff up on coffee in the morning, and stuff up on food when I get home.
I think not all flights.
Actually, yes.
I found the cause of lag in stepmania.
So I recompiled with pulseaudio, and tada, lag in stepmania.
Is today also a bad day. Days are not the same without you here.
Are you not hungry at all?
This is not rude.
Firefox kept crashing with just alsa when I closed a tab playing audio 1/10th of the time.
Just drinking lots of juice and having lots of toast.
But I am scared to mess it up.
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmfoooood.
The rubber was worn right down.
And fans.
Oh, I suppose phones run out of battery, and laptops just fucking die.
Let me think about it.
Thank you so much :D
The furniture here is going to be a nightmare to move.
Nope.
Pesto costs way too much.
It was about 10usd a night.
Yeah, my old mouse, it was still mostly fine, but the switch bouncing in the primary click got annoying at times.
It depends how long you want to come for.
It has been on our long term shopping list.
Hmmm, not for spread.
Get your facts straight.
Pinenuts hahahahah
Hmm not yet. I just ate.
`# take the washing otu`
I am awake.
Since he opens at 8pm.
Which the time of that is uncertain right now.
I will check later.
It is crude.
Eating out is always a risk.
The roundabout guy comes right outside our house during ramadan.
Well, I just got back 4 days ago.
Does it have tofu though.
It was 45gbp for the appartment, and the bus was 25gbp I think.
# THANKS LISA
Okay thank you. There is no rush, it goes into savings.
It is mostly cashews.
What about it?
Oh no I ran out of bread.
So it should be in the middle of now and that, or after that.
If you are short, do not though.
So we can order or just get there at night time.
It looks possible.
I will eat the spread hef.
Yeah I heard the weather was bad.
I have not done much.
I would not dare ask so soon.
The only electronic stuff I really had break on me was my tower computer, and a hdd.
There is also the south korea plan.
They then conclude you would have no reason to return to egypt because the UK is heaven.
A single sentence response, which has no evidence on their part.
I fell off my bike and lost the skin on my palm.
Yeah, that was for the spouse visa, a permenant one.
Hi.
Remember I had breakfast everyday at work.
It adapts pages of comments
If a network call is missing, just replace it with a dummy one.
Yeah, it did.
I could eat for a year or buy a pack of pine nuts.
It was more of a plea. Since they are within the law, the implementation is just unjust.
But worse.
But ideally no +s at all.
It was a dagger issue.
I fell off my bike and my hand got grazed.
I read the full document for that law, and the processing guidelines for the visa officers, twice.
I had no reply.
Actually the AC is not on and it is not hot today.
You do not need java installed.
I think the application navigation should be faked together rather than seperate.
ss
Which picture?
I think I will go home now actually.
Maybe next time I get cashews.
It is just Android designed to run on much lower spec devices.
I went to a chemist and they put anti-septic on it.
The UK applications were under national law.
Well, mine never made it through.
Explaining the whole story.
I NEED TOAST AND JUICE
And Visual Studio Code is now fully supported as a first-class development tool, with a dedicated Flutter extension.
I think I will have to try that out.
Yeah, I am not interested in iot devices at all.
No 0.5+ is wrong.
Naming things CommentsRecyclerAdapter instead of CommentsAdapter
Making all the Retrofit requests and responses in Java.
I am thinking about making a series of snippits.
I have one.
My neck hurts a bit.
It does not have a gradle wrapper.
Oh, yes.
Why did it freeze?
But it is far.
Which make reapplying more difficult.
I might have fixed it now.
What.
If they sold this spread here I would be fat.
Do you want to have it there or in the house.
I provided two RetrofitServices.
I think other than that, the biggest problem was the test activity.
Yeah, no way am I buying them.
If she got a company who have a license to sponsor non-european workers, she could get a work visa in the uk (if it is over 20,000 or something).
But she only applied for a visit visa because non of those things were true at the time.
At work?
Is it mostafa time.
And dishes.
I am thinking about rewritting mine in flutter :/
app  build  build.gradle  captures  gradle  gradle.properties  gradlew  gradlew.bat  local.properties  settings.gradle  stadium.iml
Oh riot.
I am home, who are you?
Can you bring a big plaster?
I am so hungry.
There is a barking dog and my brain is beginning to sizzle.
They just pick a grammar mistake, or the smallest error and use it against you.
Good morning.
No, it is Ireland and the UK.
My hand and stomach are killing though.
Pffffffft
Yeah 30 is cool.
Crazy just tried to get in by tiny backpack.
Flutter still uses gradle.
What are you trying to run?
Are you trying to compile?
One moment
It tastes a bit weird though.
I thought you left tomorrow.
I want breakfast :(
Nah it will turn into peanut butter.
And communicates with other devices using two standard.
The Egyptian government have nothing to do with her applications.
I think that was the iOS option, right?
It is stressful.
If they can use information in previous applications against you they will, but they will ignore anything that supports you in the previous applications.
I emailed him at the time under the advice that sometimes MPs can help.
You were last here three days ago and that worries me.
Yeah.
The rest is good, you should be here to finish it :D
This should be the definitive guide.
I feel sore and want to be home.
Why are there underscores and capitals :/
And coffee?
240 pages hahaha.
PACKING UP
Are you fine?
It has nothing.
But I think many many people apply, and only a few get accepted.
And also illegal again for many reasons.
I want the wonderful tray.
Oh wow.
It is so much easier for me to talk here.
Mozilla might work okay.
Hmmm, work.
How was the rest of the holiday?
Where are ll your photos.
They must give a reason, and tell you how to resolve it.
The Ireland application was under EU law.
Her job is not worth returning to in their eyes.
So I was on 11,600, I would have had to have about 14,000 in savings.
Not that I am aware of.
Ireland are just unbelievable though.
I am pretty sleepy.
But they are never sticky enough.
And some medical tape?
The end days are near.
Good morning.
Yes
I think the formula was (17,800 - income) * 2.5, but that is pushing my memory.
NOT AS FANCY AS THE BREAD I AM HAVING
It is not the error.
'com.google.maps.android:google-maps-utils:0.5'
Can you run ./gradlew assembleDebug in the command line and show me the full output?
Not using a BaseActivity
uber@lost.host
You should remind me when I get home.
Does it not work?
There are better location service providers other than just android.
My neck hurts and now my stomach hurts.
Noooodles.
I am having the salad now.
Hello.
I installed it on my pi.
Which is a straight up lie.
The financial requirements are more complicated than just 17,800 a year. You can make up the difference in savings.
Okay, love you too.
Oh, I think you can install it.
Rice has made me sore many times, breakfast has not.
** Android studio
Personal budget app?
And anti-histamine?
I just want all the exams to pass and be over.
Maybe if toka knows where they are she can send you their reasoning.
And when you look at the publications each week for this type of visa, they have done the same to 98% of people.
Make sure you read the applications first before contacting anyone.
# HOW IS 8.1
Chips in a bag...
The latest version is "0.5"
We do not care about the type of the class.
I have the photos now at home.
And some work is stresful.
Do you remember the countdowns I had on my lock screen?
That is github -> gitlab imports.
They are just crooks.
Ireland took 1.8 years to issue the visa that should have taken 2 weeks legally.
*crooks who outsource their work to the UAE.
The tourist visa I think the best thing to understand would be to see the two applications, and their replies.
My body is ready for the bread and the coffee and the juice and the videos.
I should give him my big one.
What is the error?
And keeping them up to date.
Because you are not in the project directory.
It should load.
When will you sleep?
The last one is my work last week.
But I ate a lot now.
And the response was a single sentence, "You have failed to prove you are a benefactory of a EU citizen."
The next options might be Canada, and the Netherlands.
Yeah.
And baggy.
No.
This just means java exited with an error.
Sand sand sand.
When I stayed up all night before exams, I did terrible.
When is the last exam again?
I am going home.
And since I am British and she is married to me, they think she will stay in the UK illegally.
I emailed him.
# I AM HOME
Did you eat, when are you home.
Android uses an embedded java.
One was just sneaky.
Oh, there are some pngs without density alternatives.
I have 7 days to finish it :/
Remember riot puts an extra line on the end when you copy.
Okay here is half a year of missing photos.
Sand.
Just my hand.
I am just worried about the Netherlands because English.
vcf is vcards.
The magdsoft server is being a nightmare.
New class every ten turty.
What no.
It should be 0.5.+
CommentsPageAdapter
Mozilla, Apple, and Google have them.
Ruuude.
NOODLES
We have AC.
I did not eat until now.
I need coffee but it is too late.
Kent vs milan, which will win?
What the hell.
I think Canada and Egypt have good relations. Lots of people move over there to work with ease.
You will see their attitude when you read the response.
It is like they have a quota, and the workers are told to find reasons to stay within it, no matter the number of applications.
Or 0.+
And google-maps not android-maps
I am waiting to go home.
`ls`
Just lots and lots of toast.
Was it interesting to see my work desk.
They are afraid of illegal immigrants.
Mariam.
No, if I earned above 17,800 in the UK, she could come over on a spouse visa.
If we have a break, we will end up having noodles.
It was my main meal.
It adapts comments.
We care about what it does.
I can look at it at home.
Unable the gradle wrapper in android studio.
Oh this might take a while.
Oh dear.
It looks gross.
This should be the structure.
No. I guess not.
Nope, I have not made anything.
I am hoooome.
I am hungry.
Did you see the black dynamite clip?
Yeah, it is nice on the inside.
Did you not just get back from there?
I was a bit sad.
You are at work now, right?
I will make a release build.
Oh they look good.
Install what?
Permissions I think.
I would wait to the 9th.
Yeah the lentil soup.
I am tired, but it is so eary, I should make coffee.
Good morning
That is not bad.
Wait what?
Where are you.
I fixed the double plus button.
Okay plug your phone into my computer.
Go.
and at the bottom it should say something about signature spoofing.
Unplug it.
Show system apps at the top right.
This does not even look correct.
I probably still have your private key on your hard drive if you want me to send it.
I feel like you are fading :(
Are you in the exam.
Yes you can.
I do not know if Asma' would aprove or disaprove.
Can you uninstall budget?
:D
They have com.motorola.camera, com.motorola.camera2 and com.motorola.cameraone
No idea if that is trustworthy though.
I want to drink another juice, but I will be full.
Did you lose your old one?
A .pub file is not a private key.
I told you lisa does the nastiest shits.
Both copies are 161GiB.
My favourite anko thing is the layouts.
I switched from android 28 to 27, it was a pain.
I got 6000 in the end.
Failed to install?
When I was converting back to 27, I was going quick.
I have not worked on it other than that.
Why.
You already have one.
Make sure the permissions are user readable only.
The private key will be called id_rsa or id_ed25519
Life gets easier the more command line stuff you know.
For the delivery, no.
Wake up.
He carries a battery pack at all times plugged in.
I will do that now.
Nope.
Do not install the last one until you are home though.
Just do the screenshot thing.
At the bottom of that.
And we got a 3 year contract.
To `~/.ssh/`
And if you find yourself using a constraintlayout (bar cards) with more layouts inside, stop, and use constraint groups.
BOILING
I get worried and sad when you are not here for so long.
All of those are outdated model.s
Give me an example and I will check.
What did not work about the link?
But it is some work to change.
I will psycic eat that fool from my desk.
The only two improvements I can think of, are user managed categories, and the data sync thing I told you about.
Oh, I never checked this.
Deviant art?
Do you share the rent?
Type `ssh-add -l`
Oh I am so hungry.
Oh early home?
One thing you should stop doing is setting background of layouts or views as large images.
I think the nuc is about 400gbp, the ssd (you should get the very best, depending on capacity) 150-300gbp, the ram 16GiB (100-120, depending on ram prices)
Yeah it still tastes fine.
But i wish it was a lighter standalone package.
I think you can actually install a playstore type thing.
You will have to uninstall first.
I did some profiling and the items were taking 70-160ms to load.
And now they are between 15-30ms.
When you get home then.
When? Why?
Do you not have a contract?
For the entire appartment?
`~` on unix means $HOME or your home directory.
`ssh-add -l`
It is pretty cool.
The new phone.
We were going to but then remembered the stuff in the freezer.
Are you freeriam?
But without that top because you look like a female basketball player.
I am not sure I beleive it.
And bread.
Toka's dad made apricot jam.
Any app like google play services or google mobile services.
Good morning.
Best to check the property inflation rate.
`ls -h` displays hidden things.
:D
`youtube-dl -x --audio-format best "url"`
Or have someone bring it to egypt.
Okay, remind me saturday morning.
Yeah.
That is good.
How is the weather?
Do you want to buy carrots and potatoes in your break?
I will see at home.
When you get home.
No.
In both pictures.
"You earned 15 lingots for reaching a 150 day streak!"
Two more days.
Yeah stick them in there.
Cook everything.
5usd a month.
COMING SOON EVEN SMOOTHER SCROLLING
After you rest, your new mission is to concuct a meeting.
Oh and onions.
It looks like they fucked up.
Okay, it should be rebooting.
No one cares.
I am here.
That is enough for a good nuc build.
We are on the 8th generation.
28 being final is much better news.
I will go meet toka to carry bags home.
This looks like ktx.
Api 27, I think, changed the activity field in fragments to nullable because there were certain situations it could happen.
Yeah I made strawberry jam at university.
Anything over 16.6 is noticable.
Black Mirror.
Does the play store still crash?
gRPC is what's good.
fuck rest and soap.
fuck json.
# PROTOBUF
Then do the chmod command again.
IT IS ALMOST WEDNESDAY MY DUDES
Crisobal Tapia De Veer
:(
They censored this project, wow.
DId your 3ds work fine?
I think they might be empty.
Hmm.
What was the project?
The 5 holiday days.
Rude.
It is always dodgey downloading things from third parties.
Then select GMSCore
Of course, our contract started before the stupid inflation rates, so that is why it was low.
Yeah.
The client wanted one small change yesterday.
I AM HOME
I converted malabak to P knowing that my deadline is the end of next week, and the final api release would be soon.
AE IT'S A ME A MARIO
Yeah, I think I know why.
Oh, yeah, that would make sense.
Not if it is far away.
I just watched magdy's iphone battery drain from 25% to 3% in 2 minutes.
You managed to install it?
Mmmm I added some tahini and olive oil and it is nice.
Install the gapps-micro zip.
How much do you pay aslan?
`chmod -R g-rwx,o-rwx ~/.ssh`
Why did you make a new one?
I was worried it might have been delayed and they could not install a testing version.
Get a server and vpn.
You can import, I just do not know about delivery.
Unless it is urgent.
You uninstalled it first, right?
She works too.
Did the second download work?
Yeah.
That seems reasonable.
Do you have the private key file?
Wireguard takes 5 minutes to set up.
8 has been out too long already.
I was shocked by it :D
Oh this is good.
Paint is too dificult.
I remember going into the kitchen of our main house growing up and the cupboards being full of the food I love.
Ribena needs the exact amount of dilution or it tastes weird.
Where could the gyroscopes even fit in that frame?
Your face looks different today.
I do not know.
As an alternative to apk pure, whatever works better.
So I worked on making it faster.
Uh oh.
That is all.
Anything that starts with a `.` on unix is hidden.
Soup night.
She is just going on a trip with her friends.
Last night was not good.
Anyway, I fixed the crashes, made the plus button like I said, and the icon changes for the category when you select it.
And you uninstalled it before?
I can send the moto camera apk.
It just teaches you that jam is flavoured sugar.
private networks are magical :D
Did you install it?
Can you plug the phone in?
Can you send a screen shot of that?
emojis
And check to see if what they are asking is higher than that.
`ssh-add`
The public key is the one you can share with people.
When are you home today.
Use an imageview for that.
Which link?
Try clearing the cache, then data if that does not work.
I have a wife.
HR.
Come in.
It tastes like it is from a jar.
Uh oh.
Oh uh child actors.
Yeah.
But inflation is 23% a year I think.
I hate painting.
id_rsa...?
Are you sure you have the right key?
We are heating up the frozen soup from when you came hahahaha.
Okay come in, it should be over now.
Oh, phew.
Hmmmm.
They tried to pay me 5000 hahaha.
It is pretty easy.
Phones are so shit.
Ours increased 100 a year, about 8%.
We are paying 1400 for our place this year.
We had to paint ourselves.
gRPC generates all the network code for you.
Yeah.
You had an id_ed25519 key.
`ls -lah ~/.ssh`
Yeah.
I am hooome.
I think it is in a good state now.
I used MaterialButtons for those icons, but 27 does not have them.
Oh no they make 3.
This is rated very poorly.
Can you go to settings:apps:all apps:show system apps
It might begin with com.google
But I would buy the most traced, garaunteed one so they trace it the whole way.
nuc i5-8xxx
I will look at it at some point.
unplug
Stick it in ~/.ssh/
Yeah.
I flashed orea on tokas phone recently.
It is about 4-6ms now.
Monayaium.
Are you fine?
I just had no one to talk to.
Am I in the favorites group?
I would wait for the next generation of intel processors though, and nuc.
I will try a mood tracker.
Gone Home is also good.
In the android settings page.
I am trying to find the original.
You're in and you're out.
I did the clothes and dish washing.
I think it is better now.
Yeah I am now.
After my cat, I am always scared of prolapsing.
Many companies ship worldwide.
I can saturday morning.
If you remember before I reduced it from 70-160 to 16-60 or something.
Oh I know these friends.
Well, if you get rid of the soul part.
Did you make sure this room is set to always notify?
A month long period, doctors are mystified.
Throughout the day yes.
I felt very lonely too.
I like the feeling I have that you are free to do things you want today.
It is the artwork for this EP, but I can not find another version of the image.
Oh yesterday we were going to make lentil soup.
I am super hungry.
I am super Turkey.
A second one this summer?
I asked my dad in the car what the engine would do if you removed all electronics from the car but a tiny led light.
This is the corner I work in.
Ever since that reaction to the muscle relaxant.
Yeah.
All the androidx libraries are now semantic versioned and independant of android version.
Such a huge undertaking and change.
1:30 am?
Where are your photos and voice notes.
Mostly.
Yes.
Why were you lonely?
Other people just do not suffice.
Will you order breakfast.
Are you bored of freedom yet?
Phone before computer :(
I am finium.
Here is ediths theme to tempt you.
Are you eating?
Are you fine?
That soup yesterday is making me go coco.
I will go te bed.
My stomach woke me up.
What kind of videos does she watch?
It is mostly fine now.
A friend I do not know?
I liked water color and pencil.
I just found an image I like.
I only watched it.
I ate.
I just woke up from your call.
I completely forgot about toka and Egypt, but then I remembered and I got sad.
Why would you not?
It tasted good though.
Toka is going on a trip this tuesday for three or four days.
Did you check the app settings for notification preferences?
Do you feel better now the exams are over.
Also, Gone Home made me cry a bit.
The top thing with the image.
What does she do on it?
I was with my family, and then I went to bed.
My mum thought I loved blueberry jam, and the shop did not have it, so she got the person to stick tape over the apricot part and wrote blueberry.
Yeah, my hand lost a chunk, but it was a minor accident.
I am awake.
Then reinstall?
Extended Play, it comes from the record days.
But my stomach and poop is bad now.
Stay at home today
Then I will have the tesco one.
They let you fix mistakes.
Because you're hot and you're cold.
Gone Home you should download though.
Did you finish watching it.
Fool and bitengen.
The pain was too much.
I remember going into the shops in the village I grew up in and them having little rules, and the same people.
That is creepy.
And with background code no longer allowed location sensor data, it would be impossible to make reliable.
For two days, terrible water poops.
I thought you fell asleep at 8pm.
There was a game called What Remains of Edith FInch.
I think you should uninstall it and install it again from google play.
It looked fine and tasted fine.
Will you send you.
Are you home soon.
Hello.
That night was the worst of my life.
A movie, hhmmm, maybe A Bride for Rip Van Winkle or The Handmaiden.
One day you will, and it will be your masterpeice.
DId you hear this one?
Nope, no sleeping.
So many channels target children, and they are dangerous.
And we laughed at how slow it would run.
Did you have blueberries yet?
Saving the real robinson's one for last.
I am scared to have coffee, but I also need coffee.
But I slept and I am fine.
Did you check riot notifications to make sure they are enabled (in riot settings)?
Are you painting my mouth?
I can add the balance to the small toolbar somewhere.
Did you like Amarante?
I thought I would be sick but I think I got away with some terrible poo.
I sat on the toilet for over an hour.
Did you fix the riot notifications?
Uh oh.
I quite like Amarante.
The Handmaiden is drama/something.
Maybe thriller.
I like these two games because I love the voice.
What do you think about removing the expanded toolbar?
I think the blurred toolbar looks much nicer, and it just takes up room, and loading time.
On Budget.
Children on youtube is a big issue I think.
Nothing.
I need coffee though.
Besides, google device manager does this.
I decided to work at home, but my stomach became so sore, I slept until 5pm.
What will you do today?
She is just on her period.
What will you do today.
I am waiting for toka to order breakfast.
This finally made me under stand the dagger-android stuff.
I want coffee though.
Good morning.
I have almost fnished all the H2O Juiced ones.
I am ill :(
My computer could not render those graphics.
Was it boring.
I am awake.
Then I woke up and I was still here.
Did you install it from google play or fdroid?
Paint is live with your mistakes.
A Bride for Van Winkle is more drama.
I still need to shower myself
Did you eat?
What kind of biscuit?
Obviously.
I had a dream I went back to scotland because it hurt so much.
I doubt your laptop can too.
Okay, just tell me when to check.
I am trying to avoid anything because of my stomach.
I went back to bed at 11:15 and slept until now.
How did I sleep so long.
The privacy implications are also just too bad.
I had old soup.
Was it from your mind?
You're up and you're down.
But then remembered we had some frozen from when my mum came.
I can find an uncommented playthrough of edith finch for you.
It is the same length as a movie.
Keep the collapsed toolbar.
It is better now.
I woke up this morning trying really hard not to throw up.
I need coffee, but coffee is not good for pooping.
I think the expanded one does not show enough information to be worth it.
A sinister one.
It feels full of water.
The soup made me ill.
Are you an expert flosser yet?
It was soup frozen from when my mother visited.
I am too scared to have a bad reaction to new medicines I have not tried before.
It is bearable now though.
My nose started running like crazy.
Delete the evidence.
Lucky for some.
And you be there at that time.
Say you are going to look at bicycles.
Please no soup.
I want to go home now.
Good morning.
And Magdy would not want it being used by competitors.
Nono, I have a more trusted source.
It is 1.9GiB
Busy with work.
Hi.
Toka travels at midnight tomorrow.
Oh yes.
--email karemalsaifi@gmail.com --username kareem --password kareeeeeeeeem
Why is it?
I understand because you talk about these things a lot.
get rid of the @color/md_indigo_400 and inline the value.
It is cold in the office though.
They are complaining the api pagination is too complicated.
Already had it installed on the servers.
Oh the game.
# WHAT ARE YOU CLEANING
I am really hungry.
User the command line tool does not show everyone you joining town square.
Always no :D
Does it need verified?
When it comes to the government, you have to act like you love it, and nothing to say otherwise should every be public.
The only action you can and should take is contacting his family.
Tell me to be somewhere I can walk to at a time.
Or find things only near me and say you are going to interact with that.
I did take the road before, it seemed okay.
Yalla to cairo before I walk there.
That sounds like calcaday but you drank it in the car.
What?
Superglue, resistant to water.
I am fine.
I was thinking, if I can delete all your chat.magdsoft messages would you want that?
They want to be innocent.
In my experience Egyptians are terrible at airports.
Does he ever talk to you?
Nope.
Are you even British?
Who is Mr Robertson?
Me too.
Normal is okay. I would rather google not read our messages.
I might add my most up to date build.gradle to the gitlab snippets.
Never used it, so I uninstalled it.
But it is a nice story.
Bread.
What are you doing.
Did you clear data.
I want to shower.
How spray bottles work.
Are you just tired.
The account too?
I need music.
Okay it is.
And neither will scotland.
How many people working on it?
But without acting upon this, it is cognitive disonance.
I am so so hungry.
Hmm, I can download it to lost.host and you can get it from there.
Also the desk is too low.
So I have the house with the cats.
Ever since I went to el gouna, I have too much skin coming off.
Or have nothing to do.
I did.
So I wake up in bed at 11:30, I frantically run out the room calling for my sister.
You are getting your revenge.
You are no longer in a mass of people.
His family should be at the police station.
Does he have to even speak without a laywer?
Oh I do have music.
It has remenants of the fuck up, but it is mostly conformant now.
Yeah, still working.
Okay Gone Home.
No, my computer is fucked.
Did you do the flee stuff already.
It is disgusting.
I dreamt I lived in a country house.
Even private posts are not private.
This is not wise.
I have a food dept.
One more hour.
The french had Egypt for a long time too.
But three of them are gone now.
COMING HOME
This will be the longest I have been alone since I moved here.
Are you here.
karemalsaifi@gmail.com
They should be getting a lawyer if it is serious.
A good time for your laywer friends to give advice.
But it is activitade.
This song really gets to me.
You are in my inner group. You are worthy.
Almost every country in Africa bar one or two were under the rule of a colonial nation.
I am at work.
I am home.
Where are you.
This is supported now (thanks GDPR).
Gary actually left me when he got a boyfriend.
I want you to sleep regular.
I am super hungry.
It is toooooo hot.
It is here but I think I am heating up the room faster than it is cooling it.
No reading about this one.
Yeah we started buying loafs of bread from the shop below.
I am playing stepmania.
But not for long enough.
How do you feel?
They had a reason, whether it was a one off political post, or they made a scene, or something.
Is it today?
Should I cycle to near where you live?
Peek a what.
Packing up in 5 minutes.
Any important trade locations were.
I am having coffee and toka is making misah2(2(!
It is too hot for anything.
But I was being clear.
Oh I am too hungry.
I think you should sleep at night.
Breakfast I think.
So I wait at the front door so that I can disappear or something.
This is Russia, and he is Arab.
He is arrested, not sentenced.
I skipped the email sending, the account can log in.
My body is sore.
I think this is the reason.
You can have the snippets though :D
Which means they know fuck all about SQL.
I would use a download manager incase the download gets interupted though.
Do you have ac?
That half I had was enough.
And I had a 9 day year old rabbit to take care of.
I say, watch this, it is 11:30, but I know for a fact I am coming home at midday.
Is he entitled to a lawyer?
I know.
It makes me too sad.
Say you are going to buy something from a store you know is only near me.
Oh the soundtrack to the game is very haunting.
I would be too scared of people annoying me.
Oh early day yes.
I think so. A normal amount. But it is so so hot.
The actor sounds the same.
We have jobs.
But facebook is closed.
You can do it without me.
I did not sleep enough and I feel tired already.
No, not yet.
You did not have it?
We have a freelancer doing the bigbook api and it is already showing problems.
Just run the game, start reading everything and exploring everything.
DId you play it.
That TES VI announcement trailer just looked like a terrain generator.
And video is just video.
Did you tell her it is bedtime.
I remember working over night and getting the bus home.
Good morning take two.
paul@lost.host probably.
Everything is just speculation and claims.
Airports are strict places.
I think if someone moves from here to London, everything before london would get erased from they memory.
Yeah, I guessed so.
Actually no, I still have them running.
My only issue is the story is not very relatable.
And I am not interested in teaching.
Oh, crazy, flee stuff.
Okay.
This chair kills my back though.
On both.
Half on each cat.
Just so Magdy could not see anything.
That would be visible to people though.
He could have just looked or acted suspicious at the airport.
But my inner group is only two big now.
PNG generation only happens when you support a lower version of android I think.
Yeah I felt it in the morning.
Robertson's?!?
Yes, and also download gone home.
Nope, that source code belongs to Magdy.
Even the floors?
There is no better ones here.
Just go deep with the drips.
But usually I get home at midday.
I think there is no option to keep the account, but you could create a new one.
Usually the person arrested will not tell the truth about what happened.
If something can cause you to be individually targetted, you lose.
They will be the ones with information and the ones to take action.
Will I get lost?
Holidays up the ying yang for her.
I am.
Part time jobs are for people without full time jobs.
Part time workers are treated like shit employees.
The leftmost 5 was then cairo android team I lead.
Then my mum tells me I came home already and I remember.
There is a daily cleaner.
You will just leave me, your family, and the majority of your friends behind.
And if you argue at an airport, it is not unlikely the police will get involved.
I have to finish malabk this week :/
Yeah.
Or there is a special home store you want to check out.
Agency?
If you want the roller coaster of self employment...
It takes me 2-3 hours to download.
Toka is going on a trip for four days with her friends.
I get dressed at 11am.
If they decide to take you up on this, you lose.
One moment.
It is better.
I miss you too much.
The only way I stay constant is alarm, coffee, work, coffee.
How are you now?
On my feet.
Will you take a taxi to the pet shop after calling to see if they are open?
Yeah I will finish the spread I think.
I just watched westworld.
Sneezy.
Okay I will do it.
But no one has any evidence of events or reasons.
When are we meeting?
If one of these is missing, things drift.
Robinson's
systemd?
Constantly new people, to deal with.
I think this guy is the source of that picture I like.
It is a short game.
You will not go with them, this is stupid.
My job would never come before my love.
I do not forgive him.
The more you read and observe the stronger it is.
analyse:inspect
Oh yeah I am craving bricks.
It is a shame I do not get to check why.
Jesus my computer just froze because it ran out of ram and swap, 20GiB.
It lets you change focus, and brightness, and the rest of the settings are hard coded for you.
I ate everything.
I am full.
Them seem to break often.
No no he was back last week.
Are you tired at all.
I expected you would.
I am going to be too alone.
It was good.
sat and sun off.
I still feel it, jesus.
I am almost free.
I came home and had bread and juice.
Not until you have gone home.
I have grapes.
I am so hot it is affecting my ability to do things.
Wake up.
NEED
I will fall asleep soon.
Oh I should find out which days we are off.
I am not sure.
She left last night.
How are you brewing the coffee?
The balance is now calculated offline since the local copy of the data should always be accurate and up to date.
01000742225
No.
I am too full.
I just played a track with 899 key presses in 1:41 for the first time, and missed one note, with a average timing error of 18ms.
But this tells us nothing about your outgoings.
When I come home, I think I want to spend all the time going on walks.
Wake up.
I am awake.
Okay.
No, I will ask now.
I am home.
Hi home.
Oh that is a long sickness.
You just request any changes since you last asked.
The number of network calls is now about 5-10 times fewer.
And the number of list updates is about half.
I am excited to have so much time to be bored.
I am not sure yet.
Best day of my life.
There is only one colour, but you still look colourful.
I am awake.
Where is the before and after of your eye brows.
When do you go to the country side?
The what?
I am still feeling that cake.
Okay, but wake up soon.
Just can not wait to get home to eat.
Did you start gone home?
But only casual.
How much data has budget used in the app settings?
I am feeling it now.
Wait.
Hmmm.
Where are you.
Is it all the time now?
I still want a game we play together.
Wait. You never slept.
GOING HOME
She asked me last year what the cheapest cctv solution was.
Nah, I decided to do that syncronisation scheme for budget.
What if I can make a super simple camera application.
And the primary motive is be as fast as possible.
Huuunngngry.
Now I am waiting for him to take the tray.
What happened.
I stuffed up on all the food.
I am home and cold showered.
I want some new songs for stepmania.
I am struggling to stay awake.
Oh wow that is disgusting.
I had a really busy two weeks at work, but it is the feast at the end of ramadan now, so I have a four day break.
My head hurts.
They have food.
Yeah, I think it is camera time.
If we do end up going to south korea, it will be early next year I come home.
What?
Ginger is laying on my desk, and crazy is on the chair below it, both in the same position.
I can have two modes for photos, very fast mode (capture screen), and real photo mode.
Like snapshat captures the screen I think, rather than taking a photo.
I ate it all.
I told you, I am two full.
How could she not have woken everyone up by this time already.
I am full now.
2woke4u
I am going to remove the pull to refresh.
I am home.
But that is the only other time.
Yes.
No speakers.
What are you?
I am glad it is not as hot any more.
<3
I have become so good at stepmania, and no one is here to see it.
She is paranoid.
When you open the application, the data will be synced automatically, the (0 m) at the top right is a button. It tells you the last time data was synced.
But I am eying up some biscuits.
Good morning.
She has a webcam running in her room.
But I am having coffee now.
You will need to clear the data.
I am feeling the mega noodles approach.
Will you have porridge in the morning?
I slept for 12 hours.
Hi.
She went to alexandria for two nights before.
Oh, no alarm.
A bit.
You should always be here.
I never had coffee today because I was too full.
It was a long list.
Yeah, I remember in the Irish bar you thought it was 2018, and I said it was 2019.
I guess I add and modify somethings sometimes.
Toka just left.
I want to eat so much.
But this song.
No.
I wonder how messed up my sleeping will be these days.
Yeah this never works.
Okay budget will stop working until I send an update now.
Oh it works magically.
You put -900 as pocket money.
The last visit to your family was bad.
I am okay.
IS IT COFFEE AND MUFFIN TIME
EAT
10 minutes.
thursday, friday, saturday, and sunday.
No I have loads.
It is not in yet, it usually takes an hour or two so I will check again later.
I think it tries to establish a direct connection but the vpn messes it up.
I woke up at nine.
But if lisa is too skint with her mortgage, that will be on hold, and I will book a flight home later in the year.
On my profile and the emulator.
I am not hungry enough to think about i.t
I am having coffee.
They are fine.
Why are you sad?
Do you ever stop to think what life could have been like if only you chose Narges?
And now I am tired.
How is poppy?
I am awake-ish.
Yes, it forces me into doing different things.
Ginger was really naggy.
What he wrote is the most Mariam song I know.
So a part with 3 means you wasted 66% of the drawing time.
You never usually talk when you go.
You can just look so tired and they will tell you to sleep.
The back guy is standing on a table or something, and two of them are tall.
I watched this with my mum at toka's parents.
I am here.
I am getting very sleepy.
I am so full from last night.
I ate way too much last night.
I think your sleeping patterns are reinforced by your parents.
Sinai somewhere.
Reboot the phone?
No, I have never mentioned, myself, going back in October.
The only thing I mentioned, was to lisa and toka, south korea later in the year.
Because you no longer re-request a month's transactions.
They look the same.
No but I am tempted.
The place looks a bit derelict.
I really want toast, though.
I slept for way too long.
And it costs basically zero data to sync.
Yeah, but 2019 October.
Since your device is the only one making changes to the data, your device should always be in sync anyway.
Did you clear data and it is working fine?
I love you too.
Are you all familied out yet?
I will sleep now.
The last thing I am going to do now is reduce the size of the blurred images to fit the bar, and add them to the apk to reduce network data.
You can delete the pocket change now though.
Unless it is transparent, but it is not.
Coffee and water during the day.
It is just the finger rolls.
When will you sleep?
I had two bananas.
I want to have porridge in the morning.
And you might forget if you put them in later.
The color is the number of times that part of the screen was drawn.
Yeah fuck it.
And you made me try to sing it without hearing it first.
How are you?
I ran out of bread.
I had a nice feeling.
Because I heard you sing it.
Good morning.
I did.
Very.
Ramadan just ended.
Is it still bad?
I have rolls.
I am making toasted rolls with sunflower spread.
I am watching a game called Heavy Rain.
I just slept for 12 hours.
Good morning.
Are you feasting up?
Double best day.
More neutral than a bed.
Jesus I was out of it.
Hi.
I will have coffee, and porridge, and I am free.
When they said it I thought the same thing.
Rude.
Ziad has just left.Do you like him?Yes. He is nice.More than me.....................................Nope. <F0><9F><98><8A>Out of 100 what am I?UmmmmFrom 85-90.What am I?I only have people >90 on here.What is ziad.Ziad is 75-80.What is HAZEM?I am in bed eating fake sasauge rolls.In my onesie.That's hard to tell.Tomorrow I have aerobics in the sports club.I like gymnastics.Am I higher than HAZEM?It is different.I know but I like gymnastics and GYMnastics.
You rated me 85-90.
*good as gold
As long as you know all these, you will be as happy as larry.
And typing.
Getting in here early before I forget.
I have not heard it for maybe a decade but aparrently I could sing along just fine.
Ramadan is finally finished so I can get back to my usual amount of coffee at work.
Well, when I get bored at the end of the day I feel like doing nothing.
But I woke up and felt like doing things.
I put away and cleaned the dishes.
I think the heat really affects my body.
I always feel gross and sore.
The title of the room is bothering me. Meredith's what?
Do you not have AC?
Also, are you wearing the earplugs over the football.
I would never allow myself to get into a position where I have to watch football.
I would go rampant before I settled with that.
The sport I do not mind.
We have not hungout in a long time.
Is this the first video I sent you?
When it is shrunk so much, it looks noisey.
I have some conversation of us from 2014-06
Who does hazem think I am?How would he describe me?Ummm.I do not really know.But he says you are a nice person.I do not know how he would.How would you describe him?OR WAIT WIAT WAITHow would toka describe me?I am not sure. Not sure at all.He is your toka.You should ask him to describe who I am.Toka is asleep so I can not.Okay. I will ask him.
He said you respect people's personal space and privacy.
blind as a bat, brave as a lion, busy as a bee, cheap as dirt, clean as a whistle, clear as day, clear as mud, cold as steel, cool as a cucumber, cunning as a fox, deaf as a post, easy as pie, fit as a fiddle, fresh as a daisy, good as good, good as new, hard as nails, high as a kite, hungry as a wolf, light as a feather, quick as a flash, sound as a bell, steady as a rock, thick as thieves, ugly as sin, white as a ghost.
Did you sleep?
Hi.
Is
Or you are checking scores on your phone.
I pretended to nap and now the police are after me.
I am hungry.
# HAPPY FATHER'S DAY
Sinai with friends.
Nah, it is too hot and far away, and it is with her friends.
And I was trying really hard not to forget.
I cleaned the kitchen and myself.
When will your trip end?
But the people and fanbase that go with the sport.
Yeah, I filled up the cats food this morning.
If square and google are using it, it must be doing something right.
Mattia Cupelli is consistantly fantastic, but it is usually quite dark.
The 4 people with me on the right were my android team for a year.
Here is a more full version.
Okay I am finished.
After twelve hours.
I did not enjoy talking to many people.
Sensibly, 100.
I will make ice cubes.
I have been trying to record my screen for a couple of hours.
The trailer is a lie, do not watch the trailer.
But later I remembered someone gave me a banana for breakfast.
Oh wow.
Is it because of the creepy smile?
Because it is too hot?
Is it the sims?
It is a comedy movie.
dence
I need coffee prompto.
How can people commute if the road shuts?
We are still natural things.
I had a shower and finished my coffee.
The previews of these are horrible.
Did you try setting the small small one I sent?
Good morning.
You never answered what hazem was.
Did you ask toka about what she thinks of me?Oh no, I forgot. We only spoke a bit this morning.Did you ask hazem?Hazem said you are nice to me and that you are an understanding person.Did he say I was the best person and the person he looks up to?Hahahahah.Did he say he wishes he was Toka?Hahahahahahahhahahaahhahahahah.I say you are funny.Or you make me laugh.Even when I am falling.I am fessional.
I have about 6,000 lines of our chats in 2014.
Then on the way home one day, I went back on the bus and asked her just before she was about to get off if she wanted to go for a walk.
We talked a lot.
I did enjoy her company, though.
It was a part of the log I sent above.
I watched the entire of the Heavy Rain game.
It was 13*40 minutes I think.
I put away and cleaned the dishes.
I want porridge, but I need to finish the coffee before anything.
Oh I feel happy.
The discover playlist generated from new songs this week is so accurate for me now.
These were in 2010.
Also, the preview destroys the actual image.
Oh Aly.
Natasha.
Double wow, it is still running fine.
If you download this last picture and zoom in, you can see something.
Wait, I can make it good as three.
I could have known him near the same time I knew you.
I need to lower my age.
I had robison's apple and blackcurrant.
I woke up at 1 :/
I am not sure, tomorrow maybe.
If the next time I see you, you have a football top on...
This is the playlist I am watching.
:D
It is a sport.
This was the last version.
Oh you have the version with the top too.
No.
Also, I did not follow many people.
Oh wow. I found two texts. I made toka write down her account of the night we first had sex the day after. I wrote mine too.
It is way too hot.
What do I have?
Hi home.
Are you ready for a youtube video.
What do I have five of?
I found out by coincident three days ago.
Are you bussing?
Oh oh oh oh I made ice cubes yesterday.
That is 50% of the time.
Hot and hot and hot.
The new mouse pad is really a cat pad.
I think the glasses have grown on me.
It is for sure you who creates a million dishes.
I just found a video of me and I have no idea what is going on.
I can do anything I want to.
I wonder if you can view this.
It is too much travel time to not travel time.
Oh I wonder if I can find a photo.
This is not what I am looking for.
I remember where they are now, they are still on my computer in scotland.
Okay, now it is your turn.
It is made from four colors in dots and solids.
Two colors works well too.
I like it better than my one.
It is too small for my eyes.
I never knew this.
I was as fit as larry at 21.
Eating the frozen.
I takes me so long to drink coffee.
Toka.
I do not remember it though. It was 2017-10-05.
But did you see "Nobody Knows" yet?
"You seem like the type of person who would play a lot of hercules"
It is RGB so I think scaling would work better.
I have a list of the people I followed on twitter before I deleted it.
`cat twitter-followers.txt | rev | cut -d'@' -f 1 | rev | tr '\' ' ' | sed 's/ / @/g'`
So we walked and sat down on a bench at the coast.
Do you have twitter direct messages from when we first spoke?
Okay phew.
Everything was disturbing.
I only slept 4 hours.
Where did you go.
Toka is home tomorrow night.
Wake up.
I am glad to be awake.
There is a newish FOSS twitter client.
I showered and finished the coffee.
I have not eaten yet.
I wonder if I can still connect to it.
You can try.
I had to dodge that one.
I never spoke to her for three weeks or so.
And it was the first time I saw the aurora borealis.
What are you happiest about?
I have coffee and bananas, and one of them is too hot to have right now.
it Gone Home?
Are you fine?
Have you talked to your therapist about it?
I just spent way too long making another picture
It is too hot for anything.
I am watching "Detroit: Become Human"
I will make an app to keep track of dishes submitted for washing.
Hot but happy.
Going to try to switch my budget application to use bazel instead of gradle.
What.
This is not from toka.
I will sleep.
Not yet.
When are you home?
That is me and bananasaurus.
I woke up.
How can transport of goods happen at a reasonable rate?
I woke up at 5 today.
And it's life spirals out of control.
This is you.
Yeah, 300 went in.
Maybe.
And I have no work.
I followed Hazem?
There is too much stuff in the past it is stressful.
I think I will take rolls out to eat before I sleep.
It is so hot.
Toka is back tomorrow night.
I like rhythm games and I have played it quite a bit.
I really really need to shower.
Half an hour seems reasonable.
I just turn around like a crab robot and say, "I'm safe".
Out of all the things people have said to me, two are burned in my head.
This is my favourite photo.
Did you see it before?
They look fine when you view the full image though.
She went to Italy and made me a happy birthday video with a tiny cake.
Get rid of the medicine do.
I mixed two idioms.
I feel like it, but I also can not sleep more.
And fucking ban private roads.
Should I wait?
I have no idea which photos you have seen any more.
I just converted it to four colours with dithering.
I think there is just that the smallest details are important for the intepretation.
It is interesting to scroll back and see it from the start to the end.
No, I woke up at three.
And we have 29300 messages on here.
I am going to list some common idioms that are similes, and good.
I need coffee to be happy.
What will you do tonight?
So I am trying to record in a way that uses as little as possible cpu and gpu.
It was from Nada.
Some of these I must have sent before.
I think for your avatar it should be more zoomed in.
Hazem is not hazefully is he.
No, I was engaged.
I hope your mood does not go with it.
I just looked up photos of "pineapple face".
Yeah but I am not eating enough I think.
I am always full of juice.
I kid napped.
Anything with my fingers moving fast I am good at.
I guess I have a cheaty way to make it less laggy, I will try another.
I found a folder of loads of videos toka took.
Maybe, I feel like half the things I write go unread.
I am having two bananas.
I thought I lost them for the last month or so.
Oh wow.
A few more times we walked. We discussed the best berries, got lost in the forest, and stayed up all night.
Hey, am I still only 85-90?
Not really eating them frozen.
I am having toast.
I am havign the coffee now.
I miss my piano.
"Do you smell of bananas?"
The mega sandwich.
Do we speak enough?You are in the inner group.Nope.I like that and I want to stay here.How long do you want to stay here?As long as you want me to stay here.Quite a while I think.That is good.
Okay. Should we say goodnight now?Probably.Goodnight Pauk.We have not said goodbye in ages.Goodnight Mariak.
I saved some chat logs four years ago.
Those two texts are too explicit.
She was living in Lossiemouth and worked on my line.
Happy as larry and fit as a fiddle.
Mariam is as pretty as a pineapple.
I was in charge of the line at that point.
I saw this and the song stuck with me.
I think you slept.
Maybe.
It feels like daytime too much.
You will have to watch it in 720p60 to see.
And the rubix cube, I was good at that too, my average was at 40s in my peak.
I learnt how to breakfall in jujitsu.
12 hours.
It looks like you are dual-wielding phones.
I will get some juice.
I did too.
Oh, are you happy?
But I want to record stepmania, and it must run perfectly smooth.
I tried to get audio in but it was too annoying so I hacked it in.
We had to jump backwards and land on our back and side and allsorts.
I did in in the RAF gym in Lossimouth.
Oh you are using the old version of it though.
I always want a picture.
You should really really watch Black Dynamite today.
I like the minimalism of yours more though.
It is almost okay, but the recording lags a bit still at times.
I have not made a youtube video in super long.
I had three bananas and four samboosas all day.
Why on earth would a road shut.
But it develops a taste for cocaine one day in an alley.
Do I talk too much.
Kedi finished downloading.
Will you bring midnight noodles?
I wonder if there are fixes and new things.
You missed a good, that's what he said back there.
My sleep has been wonky.
I just realised I have not updated riot.lost.host since Dec 4, 2017.
Oh yeah, it looks perfect.
I have coffee.
Porridge but after the coffee.
Because it is amazin.
And the sun affects us a lot.
Yeah, this is the first time without a reminder, I was impressed my self.
I adjusted the colors a bit.
There should be a film about a cat that loves catnip.
It is the dark.
BREAKFAST TOMORROW
Good morning.
Because you bought her a top last time?
One night is super short, the next is super long.
And ginger lays all over the desk.
But it is too hot so fuck the sun.
Will you be home super late?
That needs fixed.
Spend more money on 24/7 security.
I am pretty sure bus drivers are not qualified to do that and a replacement bus should be sent.
What will I eat?
If no one is there, drive around it, or get out and manually open the gate.
Should cargo travel all in the day and block the roads?
Just having coffee.
My biggest problem these days is I am hungry, but I have no room because I am full of liquid.
This is me.
It will be called "Copping Cat, Dopping Dog".
And are about to walk into the mirror.
Where are you?
Oh look at you.
You look so tall.
Wanted what?
I concluded bazel is not for people.
It is for huge companies that have local maven repositories and a dedicated team for making the build files.
My mood is all over the place.
Oh, riot does it automatically.
This does nothing to convince me it is not a profit roll.
But the year was 1952.
We just fancied some new rugs.
Although, I have not had coffee yet.
Will you be here while I work?
Body is adjusting to breakfast.
I am waiting for some room.
I still need to have coffee.
But the beans and ginder are important too.
But you know the best is anko layouts, because kotlin DSL, and you can just save a reference to the view in the class.
Yeah LiveData is just lifecycle aware observables.
I tried it last year.
Where did you go?
But you woke up at 5pm did you not?
What did you eat?
I am making those little line pasta soup.
I have only had grapes today.
Did you not nap?
If I heat it up in the oven later today it should be nice.
When I am out I am always checking how much anyone looks like you.
Also, Egypt shot down a Russian plane, so they better let Russia win as an apology.
What is the resolution on those?
This would be possible.
Yours.
This would have no overhead.
They just reference a bunch of views.
The problem is the layout editor gets confusing, and you have extra logic in the activity class checking to see which version you are in and doing different things for each version.
It just ends up making one complex class and layout instead of two simple ones.
Ruined.
Is is not as good as a mocha pot, but it is less effort.
You should have bought more rugs instead.
Databinding generated the bindings at compile time.
I feel like this is a type of bread for rich people.
It looks like the sharpness on these has been cranked up.
We were showing them future things.
It is too much flavour at the same time.
I do want one of these.
Two photos in one day. I will mark this in my dairy. <3
docker exec -ti mattermost-preview /bin/bash
And I know where it leads.
# Hello Mariam
It is food shopping day today. So a hummous party tonight.
I will leave at 6:15.
What is the red thing on the right?
Well if it is just the bottom, I just want to see you in it, so frame the picture appropriately.
And set visibility to gone.
But today I have not had yet.
What is a gout attack?
Have you made peanut butter yet?
    Hummous    Dove soap    Dove antipersperant    Toothpaste    Toothbrushes    Conditioner    Acetone    Pan    Downy
Okay packing up.
Oh oh yes I love you too.
@Bindable makes a fake property that is observable.
Actually, I do not like imagining personal futures at all.
Ooooo westworld my duuudes.
Oh, I woke up at 5pm, then you said you woke up after that.
But you refused.
That seems wrong. There is no way to use the standard grammar.
Going in the water, that is brave.
Actually, I think it is just because the resolution is low and the sun is really bright on the droplets.
Will you get profitrolls?
I had a time travveling dream.
Oh, you wore her zebra top.
A same day booking seems very close.
You can bind live data directly in <layout/>s now.
Okay home time.
Where did you order them from?
What will you do if the Egyptian team wins?
Or you can keep a manual version.
Okay now just acetone and conditioner.
She arrived an hour ago.
Why would someone not admit failure in this situation?
Because from experience, you never say the stuff.
I am sorry for shouting.
What is your plan today?
I will eat as much as I can.
More so the second on.
Hi, good morning.
The AC is wonderful.
Yesterday was good.
When a fancy movie ends, it says "fin", but when it really really ends it says "gout".
Hi.
I woke up.
I was angry because I have told you so many times to prevent an this easily preventable accident from happening, and yet it happened.
Hold on have to poop.
You can use contraint groups.
Probably the cheapest modern way of making non-trash coffee.
Are those together?
Otherwise, you have to use a factory to produce the instances.
Yeah I do not like the complexity of reactive programming.
Metrojet Flight 9268
And I know you are certainly perfect already.
And that leads to me getting mad.
This time I went straight to telling you to say those things to avoid it.
I just put it on.
If you put the dishes next to the plants; hold a watering can; and pray, you can do three things at once.
It takes many years of efficiency training to think like this.
Did you make dinner.
Riot you can not edit the list.
Material.
I only saw you in one dress before.
But how are you making it?
Does he need an app to sell cars on?
inflammatory arthritis
You need to use a vacuum method.
Yeah, it is going to be too loud.
That is not optical focus.
Be here as I fall.
> In the AC?!
It joins ?! together.
I just do not like the travel, the outside, the carrying, the busy supermarket.
We just had koshary.
What is it.
* Hummous* Dove soap* Dove antipersperant* Toothpaste* Toothbrushes* Conditioner* Acetone* Pan* Fairy liquid
Just tell him he edited the dolphins in and the droplets one by one.
I am home.
Be here, wake up, be home, be fine, be Mariam.
Then magdy came in and we figured his plan was to come back and start a software company.
How do you let it get like that.
Oh, you could wear extra too.
If you want to avoid a fight when you have no defense of your act, say "Sorry, it was a mistake, I will try to prevent it from happening again". If these are the first things said after the act, I will calm down and it is over.
I gave you that path by telling you to say it.
Sorry is a preface to content.
Oh.
So I super glued them back on.
Here is the shopping loot.
Well yeah, we went to the supermarket but then we saw rugs so we spent loads on rugs.
This is a french press.
Okay minus a million photos.
Viewmodels are viewmodels.
Twitter needs a lot of things.
The problem it solves is not complicated enough to justify such a complex solution.
Not the military.
The background has been blurred digitally.
Our contract expires in December.
If I was close to a place you did shopping.
How are you?
What is the doctor for?
It was my university friends and the people seemsed like 1870.
Although I hate the errors.
the synthetics have the problem of being able to import the wrong layout with autocomplete, and the id does not really exist in the layout in your scope.
But you bind the data to the view in the activity.
Oh, it is the font that does it.
I think I will make more of these in the future.
I am excited for home time.
Do you like the owl rug.
Sometimes people look a bit like you from behind or the glasses are similar.
Hi Mariam, I am happy you are here.
Okay yes you can share that one.
And it drove me crazy.
And that is what you want to prevent.
It is toooo hot.
I like this avatar too much.
Can you make the list in an app?
The ear pads on my headphones were almost completely ripped off.
I went to work slightly earlier.
Yes, they are the pinnacle.
Constraint groups have an odd syntax though, so careful.
And then make an abstract function that loads the username field.
Okay I am done.
But, you are going out, so take a million photos, but not while driving, on focus on driving.
It is easier to make problems like this.
Also, databinding is faster.
You are silent.
This happens because you never say the correct things.
I will have breakfast.
Oh I thought you had it.
But as long as it is in a box.
Did you add anything to the shopping list?
Just make two activities.
Is the meeting... in... magdsoft?
**LET'S GOUTTA HERE BEFORE THEY ATTACK**
I am too full for coffee.
There is.
A yearish ago.
212 russians on board, and all 224 died.
Are you here.
That only works when you are alone.
An incident needs to be over very quickly to reduce the anger.
Unless you have strong feelings that you can win an arguement and that I am wrong, end it straight away.
It is 31c in my room at work before putting on the AC.
But you do secretly cook batches of crunchy.
Hormones?
I am so tired.
Is it because it is too short at the top, bottom, or sides?
Okay music time.
Shame it does not have androidx support yet.
I have grown to hate mvvm :D
Livedata is just all automatic.
Did you google the interibang to use it?
I have never had it before.
Oh no, I am sorry.
We have lots of bags of washing powder though.
Maybe one day I will see you. But it will be a clone and I would be too scared to say hi in case it is not you.
Oh it is breakfast time.
They are not view groups and do not have children.
It is often not worth trying to save time and reusing code that does different enough things.
Yo, I totes gout attacked last night.
Oh wow, it is 31c in here.
Then it is okay.
Were you really waiting?
Oh wow.
Oh there was so much detail in the dream.
Is it hers hers?
I am home now.
That is a bit odd too.
Red dress.
You are invited by Eslam on for this Friday.
I prefer it.
Oh no you need a pineapple dress.
We can not go from love to football to terrorism though, this is a planecoaster.
And I think, why Mariam?
I could climb the tree outside your window and throw little stones at the window.
After work?
When are you home?
I need coffee before my neck explodes.
It did have no plaster board covering it?
Nobody has toast here.
Google maps has an experimental package too.
This is the best way of doing auth headers.
My head hurts a little but fine.
I do not want to stop talking.
If it uses the same webservice call, maybe make a base class that inflates a layout without the username field.
And we all know reusable code never gets reused.
What do you wish?
Sythetics still do findviewbyid lookups, but cache the results in a hashmap.
Which is a common task.
I know what reactive programming is.
I do like how flutter deals with this issue though.
It is my least favourite :(
The public is an unmeetable place.
Choices keep branching and open even more choices.
And then 4-5 days in the fridge is the maximum.
When does your football match begin?
Are you alive.
So he is arranging for us to go with them.
Oh.
I am going to Eslam's engagement party on Friday with Toka.
Does it mean anything?
# IT IS WEDNESDAY MY DUDES
Pure chromium.
Together?
Oh no, it is your leaving time.
Yeah I deleted them all :D
Yeah, the default viewmodel constructors are empty and with context.
But all these people are uncertain.
Because it is full of uncertaincy.
I normally never used a hard scrubbing thing, but with all the sweat recently, and the sun burn, I am losing too much skin.
I saw a box of special K, and it was tiny.
IT IS ALMOST HOME TIME.
Yes.
Hi.
Hahaha no, do you think I would find one here?
Oh, when is your psychatrist?
There is structure.
And you manually have to notify.
I really do not like UI programming at all.
What makes you tell me now?
Oh is this the first time you have used the laughing emoji.
When I am in public I see so many people.
I get this worry that too many people exist and other people could be nice too but they are all passing by and off limits.
I can not imagine the job though.
I guess it is like the weather.
Elo score seems like the best rating system I can think of.
He just came in.
It is in Tanta.
Getting a unique id of a device is pretty difficult.
I prefer databinding.
I do not like it.
So we should move by then.
But I do not like to imagine that.
In a way that deeply affects me.
Predictable, but only in the short term.
Okay I will get a job there so I can be the delivery person.
How do you see yourself in three years?
The competition is in groups.
Yeah, I am 74% likely to finish it, 2% likely the spinach wins, and 24% likely it does not finish.
That is funny, an own goal, and a penalty goal.
He said two other people will be coming from Nasr City.
It is a bit like baqara.
I need to stop eating koshary.
What do you have?
97 metascore.
What is this?
Or search for hoover enthusiasts on the internet.
I just do all my logic in the activity now.
The LiveData and ViewModel libraries are good.
A passenger plane.
So why would I bother.
What is that?
Like ramen noodles I think.
Did you see flutter rc1?
I really believe we will be forced into flutter.
Okay one moment.
Also, if you use the gson interceptor for retrofit, it adds the content-type header automatically.
Also I think this returns a 128 bit value, right?
The LoginResponse is the type of the retrofit.Call class.
And use viewmodels for livedata.
Immutability, and fast redrawing on muttable widgets.
I struggle with so many people around.
The same but with a job and a routine.
I had a mega shower.
Will you wake for a long time now?
Destroying is the only fun part.
Painting is so boring.
I napped earlier.
Two hours later she told me I do not love her the way she wants to be loved and that I do not make her feel satisfied.
She also said we do not have enough in common.
Just check out the google example android applications.
And if you ever do get married or a formal partership, nothing between us is allowed to change.
I think you read the word sleep and you did.
I am at work.
Hi <3
After painting the bedroom white in King Street, I swore right then and there to never paint a room again.
I had 6 slices of bread and 6 biscuits when I got home.
Why did you not ask?
Wake up.
If it can send multiple errors back, then it is wasting time.
They do not understand why there is an important difference between "42" and 42.
I really need to work.
The monitors.
I would like to imagine the routine and job would keep you from feeling useless and keep your sleeping healthy.
Yeah.
It is the start of habbit training.
I like that name.
The wood had no plaster board covering it?
Go shiny silver.
I think there is no way I can have more koshary.
What is new in the world of Mariam.
I get ill every time.
I have digestives and peach robinsons.
A 100-200% increase in productivity.
I like simple programming.
I start to lose all my concentration.
That is better :D
I am almost going home.
There are too many things that could happen, too many probabilities to evaluate.
Nah chicken is the worst.
Oh I am so sleepy.
Did you meet Aya?
It took four to five layers to cover that red.
Good morning.
Our webservices use internal response codes.
It is more efficient.
This is a local ip address.
Ah yeah, three three at a time just sets the bar high.
The water coming out of the beday is burning hot.
Are you sure it is not the sun making that warm feeling?
A bomb though, not a shooting.
Why has the background been post blurred?
Either to a place somewhat close to my work, if the streets are nice, or taga3ma.
We had never met at that time.
I have so many biscuits and hummous and bread but also cooked spinach from yesterday.
I am having cooked spinach.
Oh, welcome back.
Have you tried a sleep diary?
There is a new project called Saqara.
Do you have early finish days anymore?
I looked for a toaster yesterday in the supermarket, they do not exist.
I am not sure yet.
SHA-1 is 160 bits.
I can not believe you lived so close to me for so long and we never did anything.
There are digital versions as applications that keep statistics, and you just track your sleep and your notes on it.
Goodnight Mariak
Do you have a plan today?
I did not sleep much this week and now I am super sleepy.
When toka came home for a few seconds I had no idea what day or time it was.
I like http headers.
Not client_id
A LoginResponse is not a okhttp.Response.
That way you can never send an invalid request.
But there is no standard api.
Ah yeah.
It does help though.
Will you send me an email with at least 150 words?
I am hooooome.
Did the profit man arrive yet?
Good morning.
Which one is that?
It cost 155egp.
Why?
Does he get angry often?
We have something like that here called indomie.
The World of Mariam and Nada WOMAN
Breface?
Which is the okhttp.Response.body field.
Useful
State of Decay 2 exists.
I just can not be bothered anymore telling people how to make a better API.
I am going to throw the rice out and eat the spinach.
Which is the first past the post of competitions.
Wake up.
Jesus, DIY means do it yourself, not destroy it your self.
But it is fast and furious.
It is rice.
This is the naming scheme for http headers.
Yeah the 100 went in. Thank you.
This is not truely unique, but close enough.
Hmmm, maybe.
And use the response as debugging information.
We are leaving to go to Tanta in 10 minutes.
Rice can only be left 1-2 hours after cooking without being in the fridge before the levels of a baterial spore become too dangerous.
Hi, my name is Mr. Home.
Did you get all black bathroom stuff so it never looks dirty?
They are pretty good.
I feel happy.
Are you fine?
Yeah, sure.
But successfull is 2xx.
The Philippines is currently under terrible political rule.
Just for reference?
Come in.
Then today at her parents they made koshary for the first time in two years.
Hot hot hot.
Oh, two, but I do not know if I will ever see them.
# Same as always: in a mirror.
Bahheeeeeeeeebik.
I used my new loofa thing.
Oh.
Now it is a pyramid name.
And two cups of juice.
And koshary before I left work.
Mariam anticipates rain in a moment.
Did he time it on purpose?
Hey, this is my weekend and you are stressing me out with php :D
I feel them do it.
The other person looks like they have never seen a mirror before.
Yesterday she was taken to the hospital.
Egypt is 73.5 years.
There is a live probability graph.
Did you get a four pack of soap?
Or is that the after picture?
Now I have hummous and a buegette.
Without a reliance on the native frameworks.
A modern day masterpeice.
The problem is dynamicly typed languages.
When you see someone make a phone number an integer, you know there is no hope for them.
It is your birthday?
Are you home already?
Just grills.
He was raging.
Night night, love you.
Happy Birthday +1.
I have coffee and hummous.
Webservices should use http response codes.
Only if you know the names of all the errors that could happen.
I do not like arrays of errors.
I would just ask for documentation of the validation rules so you can do the validation check before hand.
Oh I would not have made an arguement over it.
They made koshary.
Are you destroying the first photo of the bathroom?
Yeah that is crazy.
But not together.
Yeah we want a better location.
Usufel for debugging only.
It might be a standard when using php or whatever framework they are using.
You will figure it out :D
I have no idea.
I usually go to amazon and sort by best reviewed.
Any errors to be used in the UI should not be localised.
But frankly, that structure looks terrible.
Give me one error because the code server side should end the processing of the request as soon as it hit a fatal error.
You sleep a lot.
Not until it has a pc client.
I should come home.
He told me to go.
The visiting hours are between 3pm and 4pm.
And now I am just dead inside.
Oh wow.
It is just ta3meya with chickpeas instead of fool beans.
Hi.
It is only 70 more.
There were only 2-3gbp each.
Both are okay.
But http has response codes built in.
It is good experimenting with things like this to learn.
It is bath time for crazy.
(toka never buys us koshary)
Okay, remind me at some point in case I forget.
When are you home.
It is crazy she is awake so late.
I am going to the funeral.
Good morning.
I am knackered.
Everyone is okay.
Look at Content-Type.
Our contract finishes in December.
Well yeah, but there are much better places.
But, I do not expect perfect APIs.
Today was toka's parents.
Oh no.
Who is taking her to the cemetary?
Born in 2016, a female child has a life expectancy of 83 years.
I had some chamomile.
I will try to sleep.
News update: still dead inside.
There is a funny face.
I am off to toka's parents now.
I cleaned crazy.
He is crazy clean.
Yesterday I had koshary at work.
I was not sleeping much this week and toka woke me up early today, because I have no idea.
If it is somewhere I can walk, sure.
I am craving mega noodles.
I guess you might have seen these before, but I have not.
Jesus.
Oh my.
Toka's mum's mum died of puemonia and possibly kidney infection today.
I am home.
There is no money for preservation and patience.
One with clean streets.
The car will be crowded :(
I am home.
They encourage a shitty way of coding.
What do you mean on Sunday?
The last one is my veins on my head throbbing.
It should never have got that bad before going to hospital :(
The life expectancy is not that low here.
Good morning.
And the status is in the okhttp.Response.status.
Yeah if you want to wake up with carpet burn.
Nope.
Oh fancy Mariam.
Do you want to pick me up?
She did not get to see her.
In the uk.
We are different people.
She said so I did not wake up in the middle of the night.
1.5 meters might be enough actually.
It is not stuffed.
I am at toka's parents.
So when we move we will look at a new spare bed.
I am knackered now though.
Hi.
Yes.
I think not.
A terrible idea to work and study at the same time though.
She lives alone.
Come in.
I hope you are always here.
Today I was at the family meeting.
Today was the gathering.
top end micro sd cards with a cheap reader.
Oh you got everything.
You will just be exhausted and do both poorly.
Two days ago, I had koshary at work.
Good morning.
Oh, whose was it?
How are you?
D:
By yourself?
Then when I got home at 10pm, toka messaged me saying, "do not eat anything, I got us koshary".
But I was fully so she gave it away.
Good morning.
I think I will stay up late and play Shenzhen IO.
No, she said she still loves me and nothing has changed.
Have you ever had a toffee apple?
She is fine.
I do not recommend buying a usb pendrive.
The same as what I got.
My head really hurts.
We are here.
But you are hiding your face.
Magdy was looking at my screen when the notification came up.
I am really hungry and really thirsty.
They were the number one prize.
How is she now?
Yeah this one.
I am getting chickpea falaffel.
Is she the person you once knew?
This is a new version of delta chat.
I want pictures.
And the dress is not red enough.
Our our place, or your parents?
Just make sure you keep a backup of it just in case.
We should still be with your family.
I was in at least one.
Come in.
I think she might have been stubborn to call for help.
Toka woke me up but I just sat doing nothing then went back to bed.
I woke up.
I feel tired.
Amr from work is driving us there with two other people from Nasr city.
The health care is terrible.
They are ongoing issues that have existed for a long time.
Well yeah, she forced me :D
USB what?
Oh this sounds nice.
Mum's mum, not mum.
I feel empty.
I talked to her about it all but she does not know what she wants.
I slept from 7 to 9:30.
I played some shenzhen io.
I am a bit better.
It is usually immediately after death.
Folk house :D
Oh, I do not know if I can get pictures.
More awake.
Amr will order chickpea fallafel.
The original way.
Toka's grandmother passed so I came home to be with her.
We had them on hallowean as kids.
I can not sleep.
But this time I could not sleep.
Oh what happened in the dream?
You can fix your watch.
I will have hob nobs and juice.
I think I am not going to work tommorow.
It was yesterday.
It is not easy to open.
At least two meters.
Just hold out until I order from the uk again.
If you can get another mini usb cable for me.
Where is it?
This is terrible.
They are shit.
I do not want to keep taking the keyboard cable to work.
Yeah the one you got for your keyboard.
A cage?
You are here all the always.
I said these words for you in my head.
Goodnight Mariak.
Carry the server?
There is an X11 program causing Xwayland to jam up and use 100% cpu.
Also Wayland is not ready.
It can cancel if you want.
Yes.
I had koshary :/
Anything stored on external storage is public.
All internal storage is equally secure.
Firefox 61 is released today.
Are your glasses for near-sightedness or far-sightedness?
Yeah.
mov mrm p0mov pol p0begin:slp 1jmp begin
The internet is dodgey.
Oh it is up to date already.
I was only two jeez.
No, you should encrypt it :D
I am home.
It is not here yet, but yes.
Where are you?
Come in.
It is 0.01mb/s vs 1000mb/s upload.
I am at work.
Wait.
Jun 26 12:19
Show me the entire class that the graph is in.
Just tell me if and when, and if not, be here.
It is shared.
If they are in there, then it is private.
At least upstairs.
I think I can do it better though.
I finally did it.
I am hot and exhausted.
Can you wait until work time? I just woke up and I am a zombie.
When was the last time you saved?
The difference with Arch is, that it comes with nothing by default.
Let me update debian for you.
It is one command.
Maybe I traumatised her.
Did you try it?
This one took me about an hour.
I struggled with this one.
What does an offshore worker on the rigs say when something bad happens?
You get rated on how much power, lines of code, and cost.
Nothing server wise takes much resources.
If it is for the company, there is no way on earth you should be using a local server for production.
Was it a dislocation?
I put a file called backup.odt in your home folder.
I muy love you giden awai fash7.
I am home.
It is an assembly language, with some hardware components.
It comes with a 47 page manual.
And fewer peices.
Also, vpn :D
It is too unreliable and way way way too slow of an internet connection.
That class better be registered in the Manifest.
Otherwise it will be not be using this class for the Application instance.
Why.
Let me check.
Did Hla start the chess club yet?
What does the demolition worker do when they do not place the C4 explosives?
Oh I was concerned.
Toka was in Korba today.
It does feel like we have not been here much.
Toka does not believe they could be good.
Enty aqui qullu siempre
I just want time with you.
What happened to my arm? I do not remember that at all.
The ISP is having trouble.
:D
Yes.
I put all our chats, and photos, and voice message and everything into a folder.
# NEVER QUESTION A PAY RISE
I am packing to come home.
Yes.
Running a local server instead of digital ocean?
Meet up sounds like the opposite of me.
Not strictly true with Adopted storage, but that is different.
You are home the normal time right?
Hla or your mother?
Finally this problem is fixed.
and the AmanStudenApplication class?
So you only install what you want.
Just expect the internet to be slow while it downloads stuff.
But they should not be exported to external storage.
Code.
I hope you are too sleepy more often.
If you get shot, you die, if you get revived you are alive, if you pull the trigger you fire (if you have ammo left, and are alive), if you reload your ammo resets.
Okay it is bed time.
It feels deathly hot today.
When are you back.
This is the coin machine task I just did.
The input and output states are on the graph below, and you have to generate them.
And you better not have a horrid dream with me in.
I better.
You can run the same user interface on any distribution.
It is higher than inflation by quite a bit.
Yeah, so this 5th I will get it.
I bet once it is decorated it will feel like being there.
You have Gone Home to watch first.
I am really enjoying playing Shenzhen i/o.
Do you like banana sandwiches?
Okay tell me the quiet place.
Digital ocean?
I can see if there is a signal to libreoffice to save things.
I remember when Lisa got a swing and it was in the living room of Kinloss I think.
That is the exact layout of new street.
There was a server problem and I am just packing now.
What happened to your driver.
I am not sure it is the season for cauliflower.
There was a bug in the first design.
shop.
Here is my creepy doll sound generator.
The MC6000 only has 14 instruction lines, and I need 15.
I do too but I have not had it since a child.
I used the last address of memory in the rom chips as a terminator for the read loop, and also to equalize the speaker.
Remove this from the AmanStudenApplication class : @SuppressLint("Registered")
It is too bloated and problematic.
I am off next saturday.
Why the pain :(
Yeah that playmobile table thing.
Just got another pay rise, 7000 a month now, or 294gbp.
There are rules in the information section.
This shows me that most people do it with fewer lines of code.
It only took 30 minutes.
I will be here in bed for a little bit.
Oh I got adrenaline.
I wish I kept more highlights of our conversations over the years.
I am going to say, it is secure.
What the hell.
@Provides
No.
A local server is fine for testing, but you do not have a static IP address, and it is not on 24/7, so it is not suitable for a full time service.
Your computer is not frozen, I am connected to it now.
I am not sure, let me think.
I save after ever sentence these days.
I told him how many hours I was missing last month and calculated my pay, then he told me I have a new rate starting last month.
It starts very basic.
You are so far away and hidden.
I can not go to bed without solving the puzzle I am on.
BBC says the UV index is E.
Are you footballing out.
That was a big big hop.
I still think I can do better.
Will you go to my work tomorrow?
But not too much coffee, and not with many people.
I love you.
Wake up.
Okay the rest can wait until work.
I am not sure of that.
It was saved at 12:19, which is when it froze I think.
I ended up hating debian.
Is it physical pain, grandmother pain, me pain, your friend who got arrested pain?
This saturday.
When will you be there?
Hmmmmmmm, I think not.
Would you play shenzhen i/o?
Aqui of course.
I am okay.
Carry what?
It should be behind a firewall, and yes always worry about the security.
How did it come out?
Wait.
Okay.
It is egypt losing the football pain?
Not the goldfish though.
My salary is now 7000.
I only remember a circumcision.
Hi.
How are you?
I think libre office stores buffers that you can recover in case it shuts unexpectdly.
Yes, that one I remember.
I guess it has almost been 6 months since my last one.
Where is the @Provides @Singleton method for the Parents class?
Wait.
Wait.
Photo the screen.
No an outdoor garden swing.
You can check by finding the folder in the application data folder in the device explorer.
10/10 self control.
Add it.
Oh, she has changed.
Okay it is bedtime.
<3
Really wake up.
This thursday we are going neighbourhood exploring for a nicer place to live.
Are you home now?
Hello.
Very hot and my face feels tired.
I do not often go to the coconut oil shop anymore.
Did the movie end and you and the driver were the same person the whole time?
As I watched this video, all I could think is that these guys are really really really bad at tetris if they think that guy is playing fast.
This must be the hottest day of the year.
Good morning.
I am hooooome.
I made two jokes today.
You are not allowed to go out because everyone else wants to go out?
But I need some.
It is the laser tag thing.
Are you a cat?
Be inside.
It is a game of laser tag.
People have done it in about 10 lines less, but this is my first working solution.
Packing up now.
Better take the sunblock.
Here you can see the specifications you have to follow.
"Oil well"
Baaaby.
They defi(v)e their orders.
Jesus.
So I guess that means ERROR :D
Because $token and $accessToken are not in the scope of this function.
About it being the weekend, a long weekend, or the pay increase.
You start to put the peices together as you watch a few more.
I like fd for example.
The first dolphin looks like it is giving you a grumpy look.
Do you have any worries left?
And my teeth are hard to keep looking white because of all the coffee.
You can have a heart for each one.
But you want it zero-padded with a minimum of two length?
Lisa, Westworld season 2 I way better than the first season.
The Egyptian government just announced a new law that makes it illegal for us not to watch Westworld tonight.
Or I set it in the Splash screen if they are already logged in.
I need to mega sleep this weekend.
I am knackered.
I have not been sleeping well for two weeks.
10 minutes for a timeout is too long though.
A library that generates the models from a DSL would be nice.
This is insulting.
Season 2 was much better than the first.
Are you home yet?
But not tonight.
I think tourists are not going to be recommened an application made in Egypt.
There is.
Just implement Parcelable, and add the @Parcelable annotation, and it is automatic.
I am excited for super close Mariam face.
I remember my favourite used to be one where you had a white shirt in a restaurant.
A joke book?
Right home time.
Make a pc utility for the benefit of everyone.
Actually, everything this guy makes is really nice.
I mean, protobuf and grpc is that, but a similar thing for https.
I have been playing it for about a month now.
I do not want to give an spoilers.
Did she do it to you?
You can do it before and after.
Or your face is hiding.
I am starting to fall.
Never.
You must be too used to your own face.
Maybe. I think there is a similar one but it is not the one.
C4 is an explosive, defy is to refuse an order, d5 is after c4, defy sounds like d5.
Workers on an offsore oil rig mine for oil using an oil well, when a problem happens, one would say "oh well", or "oil well".
If it does exist, add the header.
I did the logic you need in this project.
I am off Saturday.
How will we celebrate?
30-60 seconds should be the max I think.
Other than not waking up.
Kotlin has the @Parcelable annotation.
Did you celebrate?
What can they do?
Shenzhen i/o is another game I recently started and really like.
Me too.
I need to pull hair from between my eyebrows. I need to remove my nose and ear hair a lot.
But I lost it and it is just in my head now.
Goodnight Mariak.
Are you shopping every day.
No more code for a day.
Then in my login screen I inject the AuthInterceptor, and when I get the token, I set the accessToken variable in the interceptor to the token.
The first episode is out of order.
Tourists are going to use the big services they know already.
You ask a question, and people physically close to you answer.
This last one is nice and clear.
Whoa no.
A great language.
I would recommend this script
I want a super close photo of your face. But without makeup.
I have never seen a photo of you and thought any part of you looked bad.
No you have a Mariam nose.
Yes.
This file for the Retrofit Instance.
Ah you are off saturday anyway.
Be sorry for nothing.
The google play algorithm changed recently to prefer very high quality apps.
If there is booking, it is not not just p2p.
Unless you have nice documentation and example requests.
Are those CFT lamps?
Laura Brehm is always great.
Are you you?
I have no idea.
Okay and send everything you find.
Also, mils is a String, but you told the format function it is a integer.
Mmm four you.
We had koshary again :/
We are watching the final episode tonight.
I can usually solve them quickly so I do not mind.
I AM HOME
The AuthInterceptor is added in the Retrofit creation stage though, not injected in the interface.
I think the idea is similar to every ordering app we make.
He sounds super american.
I have 323 kittens right now.
They are just terrible puns.
How are you?
Or add a middle ware during the initialization of the retrofit instance, that checks for a sharedpreference.
Ah I was going to ask.
Somewhere there, yes.
Writing all the models takes too long as it is.
There are a lot of games that support it these days though.
Yeah, I suppose so.
We have saturday off.
GOod morning.
Do you complain at all?
And it does not help with the requests.
I think VR is still a bit early in development.
Just go with the rustic look as it is.
Good luck.
Do you like how it looks?
My face and arms are the only darker parts of me.
Yes.
Give me an example of the output string you desire, with the input variables.
1:99 is H:MM?
Do not copy the Executor for the RetrofitInstance, it causes callbacks on a background thread.
Any good photos?
Jeez.
Also, google have something coming out that will deprecate that idea.
Let me find it.
But the received json does not need to be complete.
After the very beginning the chance of starving reduces to almost nothing.
After you have played for a bit and know how things work.
Where is the professional wedding photographer photos?
But you only provide one value after the format string.
I have a longer weekend this weekend.
Hahaha :D
Brendan just called me on facebook to ask about his oculus rift.
And then we went on a call.
You do not need that.
I have some repainting work you can have.
Ohhh catnip.
I am still unsure of what is happenning this year.
Fuck tourists.
Finnish is probably the best writting system of a natural language.
Does she know it is impossible to make you look better.
I only get a microsecond to look at someone, and I could not risk a second look to confirm.
And even then if it is not your the embarrassment would give me a heart attack.
Are you here?
This looks correct.
I think the majority of application users will never spend money.
I do not care about mobile users.
Yeah.
Oh.
I still want to see after though.
Did you fall.
Record your faaaaccceee.
I am awake.
And you have a string format string that specifies two integers.
What do you want?
But I am sleepy.
I need coffee before I explode.
I do wish something faster to use comes and replaces retrofit though.
Oh this is good.
Never tried it.
Have you played this game?
Why are you up so late?
My nose gets too many tiny blackheads. But not really blackheads.
You look beautiful.
And the color of the top.
Okay, so the minutes output could be 3 digits long?
Do not know why, do not care why.
Bat is very nice too.
Yeah, Linda's
It may still be experimental, but it is easy to enable.
Not as great as written Finnish, but it sounds better.
Configuring it is a bit difficult, because your requirements from the automation change a lot.
Oh.
I am getting sleepy.
The problems with my face are my hairs because I pull them out. The hair there is destroyed. And I have a small spot near my mouth.
You can delete the message if you want.
I love you.
We are going looking for areas to live today.
Once you get an accessToken, you need to get the retrofit instance and add a middleware to it.
I am waiting for toka to come home to watch it.
You sent two tonight and your eye brows look tip top.
And instagram is tiny.
This is the dolphin giving you the look.
if it does not exist, do not add the header.
The AuthInterceptor instance is there too.
I hope this weekend I get to sleep more.
Who was it?
If I saw you outside by chance, I would never do anything.
I will try to memorise it.
I will show you on the map where the area is too.
As long as I am at work.
My salary increased to 7000 this month.
It is almost bed time.
It is too hot and far.
It can be missing optional fields.
It is a VR headset for the pc.
You should have told them to do your eyebrows instead.
They do need food.
Yeah, you can reduce catnip consumption with alternative food.
Free public transport :D
It will automate some annoying stuff.
Oh you look like a wedding photo.
<3
The HttpInterceptor for auth is in the OkHttp instance in this class.
Westworld final episode tonight.
Good luck with the last episode.
Not yet.
Tripadvisor for example.
It depends on the algorithm.
What?
It just depends on the context and requirements.
Were you worried?
I think linda asked toka.
I am doing nothing.
It has a UI to configure it.
When will you go home?
But I am always looking for you.
I made toka take a couple of photos.
You look nice.
:D
Kittens are not the only animals.
Just make it the address of a bookmark.
Are you here?
Yeah, I have this too.
Are you all eyebrowed out?
This is the place we are planning to move to.
No.
Hi.
I was bread up of having none.
Yeah.
Hi Mariam.
Okay back to normal sweaty face Mariam.
These are tiny photos.
My top gum shows too much when I smile.
Better, she is eating and drinking.
No poop yet.
I am home.
Work has been okay.
Not much new though.
I miss your voice.
It never does.
I only think the lighting or size is bad.
I had an ice lolly.
The officer areas range from 2.3 to 4.3km from my work.
Is the place perfect?
I tried to document this a bit.
Are you just craving this?
Yes.
This works, but I really need three registers :(
I will get into bed.
I will get dressed to get a loaf of bread and noodles.
Not having a slice was just plain breadful.
It was a long long time ago.
Yes, now.
Did you go out to eat?
Now I am stumped.
I am going to mega sleep this night.
Will you deliver a peanut butter and chocolate spread sandwich?
I want to hangout today.
Do you just play the mobile version?
We went to an area.
Are you home yet?
Why would you ever have a hot bath.
I have bread but no spread.
My memory is going to fade so fast :(
It looked nice but it was for officers only, and the man has to be Egyptian, and with a degree.
Oh it also does not work.
You can add arabic as a language you know too.
I am making the noodles.
> <@mariam:lost.host> Why do you stay for so long without food?I just forget, am full of juice, or not hungry.
I might go to the shop and get noodles.
I almost fell asleep but I got to hot and woke up.
This is the closest to being asleep I have been since last night.
It has a grin.
I had coffee, noodles, and now juice.
I have peed about 12 full times today.
LOWENDBOX
Can not stop me now, POWER MODE.
Oh wow, the photo I sent you with me and toka, the shadows make it look like I have a huge belly and breasts.
Actually I want toast and chocolate halawa.
People with hammers woke me up, as usual.
She is at work.
What are you doing?
I have coffee.
I am hungry.
I reset with 480 kittens yesterday, which is my record.
The user name is `toka`
What happened here?
Oh wow, that was quick.
Okay I give up trying to figure it out.
Also I suppose finding a plan for getting a better neighbourhood.
These places are 2,700 a month.
I want to mega eat, but there is nothing tasty.
I was bread up of having none.Not having a slice was just plain breadful.
focus.lost.host/login
I will show you in a bit.
Shenzhening all tomorrow.
What will you get?
Getting hungry.
Yes. I am here.
What is redeyes?
I never get to mega sleep.
I think so.
Which is not a lot.
We looked in the other places but they were not nice or far from work.
So we checked the law and found an agency man who said that if toka's dad signed the contract, and that the officer who wants to lease is okay with leasing to him knowing we will live there, it is legal and fine.
Oh I like that veil.
I have no sliced bread though.
It looks better on the pc.
Hi
Plastic bin bags are single-use, are they going to be banned too?
It is between 2.3 and 4.3 km from both of our work.
No, just nothing bad happened.
Yeah, there was a problem.
I think I fixed it.
Starting 3am last night, the matrix server started writing 50MiB/s to the disk.
Cpu usage built up to 100% and now it is staying there.
Ram hit 800MiB.
The db is only 350MiB.
What the hell was it writing?
I think it is continuely garbage collecting.
Python pos.
Well, I notice that it is metrics: collecting gc
But metrics is disabled.
I think dendrite might almost be usable now.
the matrix team writing a matrix server in go.
There is also a server written in rust, but it is not that active.
I think they will both continue to exist.
The default synapse install targets 3-4GiB of ram.
There is a progress document.
There is quite a lot of stuff written on it, just not the main readme file.
The development is pretty rapid.
Baby.
My face hurts so much.
I do not know.
Are you coming with food.
All of it.
Going to try running it.
Okay.
Well, it is running.
Are you here?
If I switch the backend in a minute, can you logout, register, and start a chat?
It is a new database.
test
Here?
Did you figure out it does not work with an email address?
You made an account?
Okay, lets try to make a room/chat, ready?
I was using @ben:lost.host
Figured out currfyg
Invited to a room, but you never accepted.
Marrrrriam.
It might not be possible.
Were you looking?
Okay one more try.
Yeah, not ready.
But at least I have it all set up and can just git pull.
I might see if I can set up dendrite.lost.host permently.
permenantly.
Obviously do not use it yet.
But it will be inevitable in the future.
createRoom is 25% done xom
I had to disable a thing on here.
But I managed to reset daddy's proper account
If you could send him a screenshot of that homeserver part.
I run my own server for privacy, and when he registered on matrix.org, it was sharing all our messages with matrix.org.
Where are you...?
She covers you on friday because you work 7 days a week?
Do you want to send me a message at some point and I can meet you to get food?
Everything.
I am so so hungry.
You should give me plenty of notice.
Oh wow.
I just got those.
Which one?
Where are you?
Which school?
You said you wait for the bus at the corner of the club.
Want to check how much cpu riot is using for you?
My network traffic console is insane.
It is syncing non stop.
84% of a core it i s using.
Okay I figured that one out.
I made lost.host also riot.
But I accidentally set the _matrix api cacheable.
When are you home.
Okay, switched from sqlite3 to postgres and down to 0% cpu.
Not yet.
My head is really sore.
I will look for paracetamol.
I moved the matrix database to a much faster database.
I can only hope you are sending an hour long message.
There was no medication :(
It has been so painful for about five hours now.
One more day then 100% sleep.
I feel cryey.
You know why.
And also you are not the best recently.
I will not cry but it feels like it is stuck inside.
I am kind of scared that days go by and you are not fine and I know nothing of it.
Our cats are 10x better shaven.
Short hair.
The circle I will refuse to let people leave.
She is fine now.
And you say mind yaarr own business.
So she asks your sister, and she says grown without shell.
Only that she gets annoyed at you for sleeping too much and not helping with the house and she gets excited with street things.
No.
Are you going to classes today?
I use a computer for 15ish hours a day.
Which is probably no better.
3.5km each way. 65m incline.
Oh I have no idea.
I think parcels are fine.
But lisa sent postcards they never told me about.
I am pretty patient when it comes to ordering new things.
This is a bad loop.
I know anxiety quite well.
It has to be years before I will call someone a friend.
I know nothing about her I think.
I find people usually hate you when you make a pun with their name.
When I read my messages I imagine that person saying them.
And if she looks like you I will freak out.
You better be here with me.
Takes 10-15 minutes.
Tomatoes and noodles and cucumber.
I hope you want a 42 minute recording of nothing much.
Do you need the same operation?
It is 45MiB.
I am not upset at you.
Just remind me every weekend.
Yeah, I remember when you first told me about her.
She is the special k friend to me.
I only know hazeem, Aya and some new guy who is going to be your drug dealer.
Your inner circle can not get too big.
I just have one circle and everyone else is floating around.
You never said anything about my last voice note.
I should be careful what I wish.
So she asks your dad.
And he says mind car own business.
Oh no.
Nah.
I will listen now.
I just had breakfast so food is last on my mind.
Lisa helped you?
I do get cycling exercise each day though.
And a smaller backpack.
Still using my red one for just my keyboard and repair set.
I did tell her to tell me before sending anything so I could ask the postoffice.
Did it implode?
I have a newer one still.
But I have not had time this week.
They look like they are all children of the same parents.
Mariam, menawar.
I feel this has happened to me many times but I never found the answers.
This is pretty new.
I do not even consider people potential friends anymore.
Is it the one we bumped into?
She is sleeping at my head.
There are many many people you do not know about.
It is just a lot of remember and stories.
It is too early to wake up.
Yeah me too.
Good and evil.
I will not be around for the worse half.
Did you forget about the plumber?
Did you know that place was called Narges?
But you being upset make me down.
And my face hurts.
I just found it.
Do you think there are things about you that I would not like?
Unknown.
Not your mum or dad.
Okay let us sleep.
My head is still so painful.
Is everyone drunk?
I am not sure.
I think the lorry is probably healthier.
It should probably worry me more.
Oh I need a tiny one.
And if it does not get delivered, who knows.
How is your stomach?
I am so close.
Breakfast, salad, date things.
A mini pizza.
I send him a summary.
There is.
I am curious to hear what you think I would dislike about you.
<3
I live on a computer.
I am not :(
Yeah, that.
Sounds like a dish.
I will leave at 4:40, arrive at 4:53.
Will you be up super late?
I should shut up?
And I will wake up to it.
I am in bed now.
I will save it for morning work.
This riot is too bright.
I want it to do the basics, very well.
I hate nothing about you. You are a beacon of freshness.
So I said to hazeem, you better marry 'em!
Everyone else can leave.
She too the injection tonight without a sound or flinch.
I was a little confused.
I never speak about them.
So she asks your mother.
And she says omg look a real life street pirate!
There was one photo at some convention looking thing but I think it was your aunt and uncle.
It was nice to speak with you.
Eugh not more exams.
I already sent you three versions of it.
Nah. All the cats here look weird.
Aya is such a new friend to you.
I think more for live conversations.
I look weird as a pirate.
Okay.
Probably not, I think most people who work on computers go home to a phone and the television.
Oranges here are really lame.
I always use a helmet.
Kind of school size.
My keyboard is tiny.
Sometimes.
But they have to phone to find you.
No I need inspiration.
I do not like the long hair cats.
I think it is impossible.
Yeah pure mazin.
I will see if they have any at work.
Hi Mariam.
It sounds like you are in the bathroom.
Is your kitchen a bathroom?
Are you in a class?
They have too many seeds and are not sweet enough.
I do need to buy cycling tights/shorts because I get bad chaffing now.
I trust someone I know delivering it.
With a bit of onion too.
It just started yesterday, right?
I am pretty sore in places too.
Hi hi hi hi.
I will sleep.
Are there nice clothes?
Yes.
Ah you made it!
I can take a break whenever, but I would rather get home quicker.
I have never tried it.
And if you do not answer the phone, it probably goes to the postoffice for a while.
delish
Noodles and salad for dinner.
My skin is wearing away it is horrible.
I have skin healing cream on the area for now.
It is fine now. 
I have a 12 day streak on Duolingo.
Oh.
I am awake.
Come in.
Under your eyes is smudged black.
But in the South East direction.
I feel like this is suboptimal, but I need at least three registers, and ram would be overkill.
I will try ram.
Oh people have done it with between 5 and 10 lines of code.
Or at least I was happy.
I have not ate since hmmmm 7pm.
I take little breaks to do other things, sure.
I will order it before someone comes over.
But she never told me.
What do you feel?
I can not wait to be home.
No, noodles then the others in a salad dish.
And pepper.
Hi.
Head and another place from cycling.
I am in bed.
Wake up when I do.
He wants a cut.
ish.
Uh oh.
Okay well the implant will do I suppose.
If you respond to everything.
Maybe in ten minutes, maybe ten hours.
Also, replies are new in Riot, and matrix. I wonder if they work on the phone.
The contract here ends in Decemeber so we have a little while.
I want toast with sunflower spread.
I got some bread.
0.5 coffee, and 1.5 juice.
I am home.
Cycling shorts.
Will it be two weeks before you   listen to the recording.
I will definitely fall mid listen.
But it will be nice.
Goodnight Mariak.
I think it counts.
I am awake.
Oh no I do not want sweat things.
You have to keep me awake.
I liked today.
Wake up.
Much later.
I am sorry for leaving you alone to be bored.
I want breakfast.
Our joint income is now 11,000.
I have had two litres today.
It will be nice.
> <@toxic:lost.host> I'm eating so much like I'm balancing this whole past week.Hmmmm breakfast.
Our flat is 1,400 a month.
I am getting sleepy.
Has to be before 7pm.
Hey where are you.
Hold on a second.
Timezones.
What time is it there right now?
We are two hours apart.
Toka will be home by the time you are.
Yeah it is almost 6.
...
She is pretty down.
And if she knows I am telling daddy tonight, she would be very down I think.
I really do not think so.
I really do not want to talk about it yet either.
What if I just tell him what happened and why I do not want to talk about it yet?
On my birthday, toka came home with 6-8 of her friends that I had met before, for a suprise party.
And I think you must know because you are family.
Since I only use wireguard from striesand, I think I will move wireguard to lost.host.
How can you be gone for so long.
The 183rd element: sleepium.
That section must be at least 60 minutes long.
This one I know.
At the top right, there is a document circle.
Trick question - it never finishes.
Oh wow.
Booooooooooo.
I was feeling really tired, and sad.
Just you?
*incoming*
And I do not like being the cause either.
Because toka is going to be home soon and I think it is too volitile for her to be around while I talk about it.
They lecture toka.
But I do want to wait some time before all talking together about it.
Lesseeww.
It would be easy with linux.
It will let you resume downloads.
Nope.
What.
Any anxiety.
You better be scared.
What have you been doing?
But nothing got sorted I think.
How are you?
I am going to rename you Napiam.
I still have the curtains shut.
Ewww.
Because instant coffee is gross.
I know this song somehow.
What do I think what means?
Not the uploads.
I am off for dinner out right now.
She wanted to sort things out.
Will you send you.
14 hours.
I just woke up.
So when someone is sad, it spirals out of control.
Every 2 years is 2 long
I told him that you two can talk because you know a lot more than what I wrote.
Seems like either no research is done or it is not the real research.
I think because phones are shitty, and apps are shitty.
Currently eeewwwwwooo.
But windows does not have resumable downloads.
There was once a famous band who made a video in lossiemouth.
I wonder if I can find it.
Do you think there are things I do not know?
Well prepare yourself.
After the first day of it, I wanted not to think about it again.
Oh.
You can center crop it.
Wake up.
I never went today.
I am just sad and tired.
I am going to send a summary about what happened.
Or a second coffee.
It failed again?
Oh, just stream it.
You can open it in a new tab.
Only if the new one is better.
Yes.
This is 16MiB, a free and open source download manager for windows and linux.
Everyone in the video is super english though.
You should defriend yourself.
What do you add?
This must be a boring section.
Did it finish?
No kiara?
It is weird.
Eventually everone leaves, and I call Lisa.
She gets upset because she thinks I hate her.
He worries a lot.
Well, that was much much easier than openvpn to set up.
Some date things I think.
He said it was never an impact assesment.
They could not be that important then.
Yeah I am fine.
Maybe I need to choose the music.
I am sorry; I am being to hard on you.
Yeah it will be nice.
Hey.
Later in the night, I go to find toka, she is in our room having sex with her friend Salma.
Not much happens the next week and a half.
Good morning.
11x the enjoyment.
I need breakfast.
I like this picture.
Yes.
Then why is an unstable connection an issue?
This is lossiemouth.
You light up the room.
I think it is getting a bit better now.
I remember it.
You did not?
Hlamit!
It should just stop.
Jeez, you never talk in this room.
But I can not speak for Salma, or others. I do not trust them.
She knows I do not like parties, or birthdays, so this was the first mistake.
Lisa was pushing to talk about it because you were worrying so much.
Did you not listen to the message.
The opposite of ewww is wooo.
I am sorry for keeping you worrying.
Well, since you were 4, I think you lost weight.
Toka wanted to talk.
But let us not talk about that now.
I slept until 3.
You are off today.
I guess flights will be the same as always.
I think we are in a feedback loop here.
They brought alcohol and it was consumed.
LIsa is shocked, mummy joins.
The biggest takeaway is a huge drop in trust.
She has no real reason or justification.
You asked how I was just after it happened, and I did not want to worry you but I could not lie.
Generally I am fine. I just trust toka less.
I am still fine here; I enjoy my job and day to day I can do what I want.
For now though, we can only talk on thursdays about this, and not while toka is here.
Lisa can talk to you too about it, she has a lot more infomation.
Okay I left quite a long set of messages.
I need coffee and food.
But there better fucking be an impact assesment somewhere.
Hi.
Oh manwar.
You did not what?
You are sad a lot about your situation.
And you are in the transition to independance.
Santa clause is coming, for you.
But it was not very effective.
I am quite drunk so I talk to the other people about it, but they were useless.
In the morning I call Lisa and mummy again to get them to moderate a conversation.
Two days ago I was quite sore and angry and brought it up again.
Maybe it is.
But it does not fill the whole circle.
You were hurt though.
I do not know if you like this but it is super catchy.
Are you happy for today now?
How can it be so late.
Were you bored?
Hi.
You want to stay in our spare room?
We went to a park.
You better not jump.
Was that not the last one I was there?
I just whistled with a cup.
I need a chef.
Mine still really does.
No scripting on it.
It is.
Come in.
If you can promise to forget about things and not let them cause sadness to you again, I can too.
When you get sad, I do, and when I get sad, you do.
Where are you.
When are you going to change your picture here?
With salma, you made a mistake, but one caused by alcohol. I think neither of us should drink that much alcohol again.
No, I said why in the message.
Look at lisa flashing around her riches.
I think so.
Okay so no more making each other sad.
I am sure there are more from before riot, which are in another folder in a giant mess.
I hope things are better now.
I do not like that everything is making you sad and down.
It is banned.
But I find you listen to it later.
These ones only go back to December 2015.
The bathroom atmosphere
Around 300.
Where did she go, Alexandria?
I mean now the problem is the time is not that flexible.
Is it not best to figure out the cheap flight days first, then book the days off, then book the flights.
Oh wow, two days to christmas.
Okay, only a month away.
Will you bring noodles?
When are we going to meet again.
She feels bad.
But I really like eating.
Did you like Tambour - Sleepers?
But that is where I live.
It starts to go away when I do not cycle.
I will take some pills.
It is just paracetamol, anti-histamine, and b12.
Things are still happening.
I will tell you how things are in a week from now.
How was Charley?
I need to wear more appropriate cycling clothes.
Oh, no.
I think I was being too harsh.
I did not shower yet.
Okay, I will have a look.
Also no more cheese or eggs for me.
I keep all the original uncompressed versions.
Because I like original copies.
The folder of our voice messages is 942MiB.
I sent her some messages.
Because my headache, my allergies, and my diet.
I will shower.
One who gives me something new every day.
This is not for it either.
But you will like it.
Nah the cats are fine.
Do not worry about it.
Nothing.
About to take a showe.r
I slept for 14 hours.
Nope. I better not get the cold again.
Will you send you.
At least 24 megapixels.
Never.
I have never seen that.
Okay fine you look bad :(
But you want tuskan.
They both were this morning.
I had to walk.
Then got mohamed to talk to that guy.
Did you take her in the neck cone?
Well, let me tell you otherwise.
But then the flavour could be put in it.
I wonder if anyone has tried making wierd toothpaste flavours.
A fool scented candle?
I think not.
That stuff tends to attract ants.
Which place in tagamo3 do you live?
Are you a diplomat?
How much is that?
There is a lot of shite there.
I think nobody here even knows.
Yeah.
That guy had no idea about anything.
A work person who was outside.
When someone fucking else gets in a taxi, you get out.
Did careem charge you?
fool toothpaste
A cup of fool?
He was fine.
He was asking me because I mentioned wanting to move there.
You should research prices.
Where the taxi is in the picture.
He got in the car and I got out the car.
The taxi driver was stupid.
Why 5 more days?
Sorry, they are shitting in the sink.
That is funny.
I doubt it, chocolate makes your teeth horrible.
Okay work time.
Magdy is thinking about moving the company to taga3ma.
Yeah.
no.
Okay read to turn off the computer.
I got in and he was going to drive me home but he said one minute then called his br
They are shitting in sync.
Where did you go.
Not tuskana, or tuskani, or tustus.
Do you take long ones?
Who knows.
It it expensive?
Could you book me a taxi?
Well, I do not want to look at my groin.
In voice, yeah.
Color and registration.
No taxi happened.
Come back.
Which groceries did you get?
Magdy is thinking of moving the company there.
Give me a moment.
So I looked around.
other who lived in the same building or something.
I had to walk home :(
And some other one I did not trust so got out.
She said not to take it off.
Did you get pineapple?
Chocolate toothpaste?
coco toothpaste?
10.20
I am at work.
Also asking where you worked.
Is it just 1-5?
We only pay 1300 a month.
When I left the building there was a silver hyundi with a kareem driver right outside.
The number plate was wrong.
Then I walked.
Oh dear.
I want an apple crumble.
syringe
What should I eat.
Come in.
I want apple crumble.
Not sure how to make the crumble though.
Yeah that is the big problem here.
Honey...?
Are you napping at university?
Did you pay anything?
It looks like they have appoligized already.
A copy paste one, but still one.
I still have not ate.
I am tempted to have mega noodles.
...
Only vaguely looks familiar.
I have been watching the old tomb raider games.
The uncharted games are pretty similar to the newer tomb raider games.
I think you used to play more than me.
There are so many degrees of movement.
Good morning.
I have the onsie and undertrousers.
I am home and showered.
Right that is me home.
Ah, it is the stuff you end up wanting the older you get.
Soon you will be wanting tissues.
So I am going to try compressing it as a different format than mp3.
And hope you can play it.
Well, that plays in my browser.
WHERE ARE THE PRESENTS
I did the one of everything strategy.
I got bored of solitare, but toka has thousands of games in it.
The games are so expensive.
And running with a girl away from shadows.
We went in once.
It is half finished.
I am too tired.
This is currently?
My keyboard is so loud.
Oh you are probably asleep by now.
You said at the beginning a walk would make you tired, then at the end it will wake you up.
What did jane and lisa get you?
Okay so I have a 17MiB voice message here.
I think this must be the longest set of unread messages ever left in this room.
I ate them, so now I am the cumarotum.
I was going to open them now, through the ** power of the internet **.
An olive, jalipeno, carab, doum, fool, hot chocolate.
Like olparumolate.
Best place for Law I think.
I stuggle with space landings.
That was a good game.
Nah I have work.
Yeah.
Not yet.
And super thick socks.
Jesus.
For medicine?
It is a bit loud at work.
Hahah that is a great photo.
Are you warm?
I thought about it but I need to finish the fool before other things.
Oh I do not remember that.
x plane?
We both have a stupid number of hours in tetris too.
They have impossible to get things.
They look more like apple granola bars.
It had a sequel called Shadow of the Collosus.
firefox-nightly?
Wait what?
Use context.
Whoa I could barely hear you before you whispered.
I am listening again.
But the internet is really bad.
It is a cold day today.
All in one mouthful.
It is a joke.
She must have finished school by now, right?
The recipes are insane.
A very different game though.
Okay.
Cheerio.
No, at 1am.
What did you guys get then?
Oh hello the Mariam.
Did you tell her maths is easy and to get on with it?
Figure it out.
You do not play any games these days though, right?
The second one, oats are pretty hard to find.
Oh yeah.
I really want to play through that.
All I remember is it being difficult.
It is Christmas.
Let me get my headphones now.
That is the road into elgin, right?
You could say you are making a voice diary.
You can paint me.
I doubt it will be today, but maybe this weekend.
Where are my socks.
Oh wow.
I think 3 is the first one I remember though.
The only games we play on the phone are solitare, and word cookie.
It is a really high rated game.
Soap.
I hope you come back.
What about now?
I have cucumber, tomato, carrot, and doum.
Oh hello.
Well, busy working right now.
No plans for later.
Come in Mariam.
Spontaniously paint me.
I am home.
Jesus those are huge glasses.
It was you who got me into guitar hero.
Yeah you played a lot of that one.
The same I think.
Hmmm.
Blame the cat.
No snow here this year, yet.
Until it looks like me.
Wow, super typical.
Law in Aberdeen?
Still, people love it.
There is a famous baking shop near.
I want to stay inside and rest.
You can have my fifty.
Does my nose ever stop running?
Merry Christmas!
Yeah, not a bat of an eylid.
**DO NOT NAP**
Nah I just got home.
I had a carrot, a tomato, a cucumber, and doum.
I still have it with the ps2.
It was great, obviously.
But I will listen again when I am home.
You just need some real snow.
I am fine.
You could not sleep because it was christmas morning.
No playstation for you then?
Nope, I do not pass the place.
Fiiine.
Oh my internet is so so bad.
I have been trying to send something for ages.
I can not connect to lost properly.
But perfectly fine jumping through some other servers.
I have a suspision tedata are fucking with me.
This is what I wanted to send.
Do you remember. I wrote you a song.
I almost could not believe it when I found it.
I will have fool.
It is like youtube, it has been around for ages.
And all my presents :D
Yeah I will make a shopping list at somepoint.
The first time you say you are very happy and for me to y'all's be there and I could not.
**Spontaneously** paint me *inside of bed*.
Okay.
How was the walk?
Oh wow your home and street are so fancy.
Wear the onesie underneath.
You have things to hear and food to recommend.
Or easier, `pavucontrol`
There are lots of audio things to understand in pavucontrol.
Easier than academic stuff sure.
I am boiling a large pot of water to take under the desk.
Will you listen to the message.
Or thursday.
If you can last that long.
Come in.
And cold.
Well I do not want to live an unreasonable distance from you.
They take too much money.
Why did the message make you very happy.
Are you awake.
Oh no Mariam.
**You can do it Mariam**
*Mariam is inspired*
Paid of course.
Pages are pretty dense.
I need **HOT** chocolate.
Yes.
And using a map while driving can be dangerous.
Noodles maybe.
Just from the shop below us.
The ta3meya guy.
But it is like that for everything.
Do you not have nice jumpers or coats?
Will you come to visit me?
> I need more *inspiration*, Paul!
Paid per page.
Jeez.
So the max is 100egp, and the min 50egp.
He said, okay or Saturday.
Hello, from inside the message.
How did the snow turn out?
Mistake.
I need Chotolate.
Everyone in the android team has two screens now :D
It is almost home time.
Oh internet.
Are you still asleep?
alsamixer
But I suppose it will be better english because you will translate it instead of him.
80-100 per page?
Yes.
Yes to food and that food.
Why is its tounge like sandpaper.
My sister gets 500 an hour :(
Hla is the only one to trust.
Shit yeah girl, you hella outdated.
I was going for the life is strange linguo.
Yeah I will.
socks, shoes, and cycling shorts, mostly.
I will do it wednesday I think.
Oh no.
It is toka time.
I will be here past twelve.
Please.
Set an alarm.
I feel sorry and sorry.
It is much smaller.
A bit late.
I have to drink coffee in 15 minutes.
Did the file work?
Understanding your messages is a game.
How did you manage to play it?
Wake up.
Odd, but now I will send it like that always.
I just woke up.
I wish I could just teleport to work.
You could take a shower for ages then put on all the clothes.
Yes.
I want it.
I am trying to to smile at work.
Will you get a map, and walk around tagamo3 this year making notes and highlighting the good and bad places?
And I have no trust.
I am so happy I have a video of you.
I am recording, a message for you.
Late in sending me photos.
Not from me.
It would be much more appealing.
Outside is awful.
Only if you are in it though.
Oh I am so excited to watch it.
But I think not all places there are.
But you like walking.
I am home.
I will leave the toka report until later though.
It is the same password, not generated.
Please do not be.
Why.
Above my labour price.
I told him 50 per hour.
Late in meeting me.
You better watch it or I will give you a A-.
So I will be back in 30 minutes.
I do not like agents.
Where are you.
I wonder, if you will hear.
What are you doing?
But you do not have enough money.
Yeah.
Shit, I deleted it yesterday.
Then calculate how long a page would take.
About 40-50egp an hour
He said tomorrow if you can.
Just make sure you time it.
Yeah.
Distract them with fancy animations and they will forget about everything.
It was better for my emotions.
**SPONTANIOUSLY** paint me.
No outside is too dire.
Use a shower cap, but better than that use a hair dryer.
It is home time.
But worth it.
It will be just like the contract I fixed the english for.
Want to guess how long a page will take?
But I also set an upper limit of 2 hours per page.
He was happy with everything as it is.
Yeah daddy is coming anyway.
Just busy work.
Did you not record anything?
You are right, Aya would have been up to no good.
Yeah, tomorrow is shopping day.
16L of robinsons quadruple strength.
I need to get to work.
I am at work now.
They are both jokes.
You will have to play around.
I have nothing tonight.
Magdy is wonder if you want to do translation work.
Okay coming home.
It is my weekend now.
Oka.
We are having spinach pasta tomorrow.
As long as you are not hanging out with the laundry.
So a plum, peach, mango, are not.
I have a 17 day streak on duolingo.
I hope you are not secret sleeping.
I need coffee and orange juice too.
I am not sure what you mean.
Of course it is.
I am so tired.
About what.
Hold on.
Do you remember how much we paid for the certificate translation?
He said okay.
I mean it is the designers design.
It was when I was 21 or something.
I have some long johns here but they are a very weird size.
15-20 in the day.
No, I love you.
Nah, I have my jumpers.
I think.
Dumb fact #143
Never gave that a click but it was worth it.
Where are you.
When are you home?
What should I eat?
Oh be awake for an hour.
Did you listen to the messages.
Juhanya is not as good as beyti.
You can.
Translating 2-4 page contracts when the client is native english.
Which is funny since I am the senior there.
I mean fine, but I do want ol2as.
She had her emotions the whole time but never ever expressed them.
My dad was much more expressive, but I liked my mum's stategy better.
It never rains.
I just tried to fix the translation.
I would take a value of 7 hours for 250-300egp.
Do you have 4-8 hours free by the end of tomorrow?
Tonight I am just eating waterever is in the fridge.
My mum only cried to me once.
I am so glad you are my friend.
Nobody could fill your place.
Eugh it looks so nice there.
Banana trees do not grow bananas.
I made a bed on the couch.
As in earlier, I did now that you sent it.
Were you waiting for me to wake up?
I mentioned you have work today and tomorrow though.
Our holidays were 3-4 months long.
A walk at night when everyone is asleep is much nicer.
Or tights?
It is pretty freezing.
We have no heating.
And now I feel stupid.
It is a fruit with multiple smaller seeds inside, instead of a stone.
I am waiting for a live gaming stream to start.
I am super hungry.
You are here.
Oh in that case hurrah.
I would do the ux different.
But I have tried to make his shitty design as nice looking as possible without anyone complaining it is too different.
It is also the first time I have done the full design for any app at the company.
Shopping day tomorrow :D
Weekend time now.
Have this.
Even colder next month.
I have hot chocolate.
I am not doing anything either.
The cleaner did a shit job?
I wanted to make a super fried onion panini.
I have fool.
I slept.
I can hear her.
I just worry about you worrying too much.
Leggings, thick ones?
It gets down to 6C at night.
What will you do tonight?
I have onions.
I need coffee.
How will you get home.
I am so glad you are here.
You are going to want plently of thick clothes.
I am quite very hungry and there is nothing but berries.
I just woke up.
You are going to be suprised how cold you are here.
Banana plants do.
But a banana, eggplant, pepper, cucumber, tomato are berries.
This is how my wednesday nights go.
I wish I had some *real* berries.
All frozen though.
I woke up.
But no bread.
I just learnt what a berry is.
Sure, but tomorrow.
tomatoes
Noodles.
There is not enough room for writing the value of the project in words.
I think the translation looks spot on.
But the capitilization is iff.
Full name: not Full Name:
Only titles capitilize every word.
Contract Information would be correct.
But Number of pages in agreement
But yeah, that took an hour, right?
I think he will be happy.
Oi.
Just have to research which shoe is best for city life.
Hmmmmmmmm.
Which makes me a 5/6...?
I need to look this up.
I used their size guide.
10-14gbp each.
I never got anything for christmas or my birthday :D
Yeah but never turned it into things.
I am so excited.
It is not for me.
So the seat and the trousers?
Yeah, I am going to form a shopping basket on amazon.
21 November 2014 was when I bought my last shoes.
For a 124gbp.
I want a new backpack for cycling, a new helmet, and a pump, maybe some inner tubes too.
This one.
The last one I sent.
Oh god, I want all the cycling things.
I will send you some more.
Send me which items I should order myself, to save a bank transfer.
A bit yeah.
Okay I will not order just yet, in case toka reminds me or wants something.
Where is the labour in that?
I think you slept.
Lisa ordered it already, so expect packages.
Eugh.
I can not see the size I bought :(
Let me find a ruler.
My big toes to the heal is 24.5cm.
I can leave him a message.
What is your price?
Yeah go for it.
The only problem is the 10.5 and 12 hour travel times.
But I will have a look around again.
it is my only email address.
I carry only my keyboard.
All of this is a game of getting the right sizes.
Total.
Oh
small
The PL8030-4/4length variant.
It is shopping time.
Which is a 9.
Yeah.
I looked at all sorts of other socks and none seem to compare.
7/7.5
I got a 5gbp pump here from the internet and it sucks ass.
Back is 12 hours.
Okay.
If there is anything I really want over it I can pay from my money.
Have you played crosscode?
Cold.
The socks are expensive.
The backpack because mine is so old and big.
Hi.
Pretty sure I got a 9, returned them, and got an 8.
Seems to be no better though.
Oh and cycling clothes because my groin has no skin.
This looks good, but let me watch some reviews.
So it is fine I suppose.
one of these.
I have been doing my shopping list today.
I don't get how people have such big legs and waist.
Right now I am just trying to solve my problems: chaffing legs/groin and punctures and flat tires on cairo roads.
I feel like I have ran out of energy.
No.
No, but she is the one paying for everything.
The cat just prolapsed.
She said pasta and spinach.
Just need the coconut oil and apples now.
No limits shop-em
My current shoe is 27.5cm high.
Yeah that is odd.
7/7.5
Or crop it or something?
Wait flights are later.
Okay.
Next up, cycling things.
This was the bag I wanted about 4 years ago.
I just need my keyboard and cycling tools.
paul@lost.host
Cycling.
The one that cost 35gbp, is red, and small.
You have a large crossover time, and data in the EU is not expensive any more.
Hahahaha
And I think one last thing, a seat.
The whole gear stuff is a bit low quality too.
Okay so I had to make a shopping list.
And a light backpack.
Hello.
I would like another coffee though.
Shoes number 1.
I wonder if I can email them about the order.
The shoe is so worn I can not see it.
Could you send a picture of the arabic part pointing at it?
They are the only socks I have ever had that have not worn, are comfortable, and fit well.
12L is probably way too much for me.
Oh and my headphones.
That black fleese I got two or three christmasses ago.
Super okay?
I am back to the boiling pot of water stategy for my feet.
Working while at work feels like cheating.
five fingers
As in the best price you found.
The socks are depressingly expensive.
Two of these in black, medium.
Bicycle pump.
Yeah.
Using the size chart for these trousers.
My handle bar tape and breaks are a little shitty too.
Tell me if I am forgetting anything.
The bike stuff is just for durability on the road, and less chaffing.
No way dude.
I have my legs up on the table infront of me like I am giving birth.
No nothing.
It is only my mum coming.
She got her first new pay today :D
She may as well just buy a spinach sauce in a jar and tell us to heat it up.
This is the new version of them.
No wait, it looks right, but hold on.
Three years I have been wearing these three pairs of socks and not a single hole.
Make sure to forward the booking information to my email.
Okay, three pairs if you are feeling extra generous.
119gbp it says here.
I guess around 3-4L.
The black one I want but it is 58gbp right now and the red one is 35gbp.
I cycle 7km a day.
Yeah, I did.
There is 11.
What am I at?
The furthest to the right.
Reminds me of phantasy star, ragnarok, and chrono trigger.
I can not get comfortable.
So is the main thing.
A place with the biggest bed and no one to comment.
Come in.
Things like that are becoming so common.
Oh wait, nevermind, helwan is cario.
There was a mosque a month ago with 700 people died in a bombing.
Sun city mall.
<3
Yeah.
One of those.
Two of these.
I have only just started it.
My mum used to do the laundry at work.
Yeah I know.
Can you call the vet pissed?
And I am so angry.
Where is your shopping list?
Why am I awake.
Why am I still awake.
We will get food from carefour, then the vet again, then home.
I got some oats.
It was in helwan though, almost a different country than up here.
One day I really really want to build my own bike.
100x earplugs, bicycle - [ tights, 2x tires, 3x tubes,  seat, pump ], shoes, 2x socks.
It is super soft and warm.
Are you super fine?
But okay.
It is a game about someone in a virtual reality mmo.
What?
What will you do?
Yeah I did.
End of january will be my christmas.
Are you in the kids area?
Morning.
I mean, I would not mind a new rucksack.
I am not sure what is at home.
My voice is bad today.
It was 1gbp for 500g of oats.
Not even brown on the top.
I started playing a game called CrossCode which i like so far.
Well that is as difficult as putting frozen spinach in a pan and waiting.
Did you see the shopping list?
Last time it was all computery.
I am at parents.
Toka said.
Which shopping center are yo at?
I should be asleep.
Good morning.
I have a ruler at home.
The one I got was tiny, for cycling.
One I could use for travelling to.
He said he did not look at it yet.
But tomorrow the business guy will review the translation.
My fingers hurt from the cold.
Not as many as I would have though.
Not defrosting and cooking just for one.
I remember when I had whatsapp, I think I had 100,000s of messages.
Tonight, is the crumble making night.
Yes, she will.
To where? And why.
Fun at a mall?
I was thinking of aswan.
Which is a massive massive attack.
Yeah it will be the 305.
It also looks like I have a massive cameltoe.
Is that a lot?
I stuck the grill on and it browned up quickly.
When are you home?
He has not had it yet.
I will go to the vet again.
A bit comedic.
What?
She fucking prolapsed.
I thought om mohammed was cooking?
Hmmmm.
I think just above 24cm long.

Does youssef have a pass to see you?
His speach is very mumbly.
These ones are assumed.
When are you home.
He did Dead Set.
I really hope we have a non heating non colony cat soon.
The market is pretty lame.
Which place?
Oh no.
But it is still early.
What will I eat when I get home.
3.5gbp for 600ml.
I think it is coffee time.
Nowhere near enough topping though.
It was not even 2018 today.
Okay.
I took some apple crumble to work for Kareem.
Churches are getting bombed way too much.
I should never trust other people.
Big enough to carry plently of shopping.
When are you home.
It is bed time now.
Morning.
Oh wow, does her dad own that place?
What is your theme?
What?
Can you put cream on?
Love you.
Are you here.
I am eating all the apple crumble.
Bring orange juice and tissues?
I am eating the entire apple crumble.
He said they stiched the colon to the abdomen, but that part of the abdomen is weak.
Are you home.
I am home.
We went to the supermarket.
Lisa has already ordered me a backpack.
I am too.
18,692.
I will make apple crumble tonight.
Oh and if you have the money on you, orange juice too.
Yeah.
It has been in the oven for two hours now.
Oh shit.
I have the small one here.
I really hate the rounded text inputs.
She is still prolapsing.
It was good.
And pharmacy.
Okay shower to heat up time.
The app?
So not really.
Did you hear the voice recording?
The home, and work are my two destinations.
You better be safe.
Maybe a little bigger than the one I have now.
Yeah it was a bit expensive though.
Yeah.
That does not sound Arabic.
You are the 153 element.
What are you doing tonight?
Why is there anything?
And Brass Eye.
The doctor is a special one I think.
The muscle they stitched it to was too weak.
kareem.
How are you?
Oh I do.
Old.
They literally needed photo evidence to believe us...
Well, do you want to make apple crumble with me?
After spinach and pasta?
It is in the oven.
It was quite good, yeah.
Okay.
Ah yeah, I was talking to Eslam.
What are Mariam's new year resolutions.
I stopped flossing everyday, I should go back to doing that.
To hit 1 million mariam messages.
You should really drop everything and watch all of black mirror now.
With more oats and flour though.
Bedium.
Are you going to work?
In the fridge.
* Be awake more* Worry less* Get better medicine* Paint more* Gain more independance* Cry less* Eat less ewwy
I have only seen to s4e1 so far.
There is a pet shop, vet, coffee shop, spice shop, and baking shop right next to each other.
It is stupidly cold today.
Wait, did you manage to log in?
I  was working christmas too.
I am not that happy.
I am really enjoying it so far.
You said happy new year in bed last night.
**VROOM**
To play more games.
You never listed any.
To get mariam to use mariam@lost.host
Did you log in?
**MOVE OUT THE WAY**
**FUCK**
I am.
The writer and producer of most episodes is Charlie Brooker.
Both worth watching.
So he took the stitches out, 3 days of cream and cone, two weeks, then a second operation to take the colon stitches out and stitch it to a different strong muscle.
I would make it again.
We can visit the spice guy and the baking shop.
The cat has to go in to get another operation in two weeks.
But one of them failed.
I am just doing the design, not the logic.
The frozen, are you talking about the weather?
And black mirror.
He is the best person I work with.
Quite kind.
No more tiny amounts of cheese or egg or dairy products.
Maybe to bake more.
There could not have been another outcome really.
The visit.
They have to redo the colon stitching to another muscle.
It will probably be another 1500egp :(
The api is not even made yet.
Where...?
Happy Monday.
At work again.
But I never recorded it.
It is data dump.
You have not sent you in age.
I would imagine every few hours.
Is it a he?
To type faster.
To cycler faster.
I am sorry, what were you saying?
Waiting for toka to get home to watch the next episode.
Yeah the cycle there was difficult.
I am.
And toka's attention is too much in her phone.
Maybe.
I think it is the bike.
I have to carry it up 4 floors of stairs.
I am glad I am cycling every day, no need to worry about exercise anymore.
I am better today.
You will have to send a photo.
Couple of days late.
It has 15 people in now.
The guy is fucking retarded.
To keep my duolingo streak going.
To set up a spam filter on my email.
I am home
Did you click the heart for like?
This is
Do you work today?
Oh, ro, the rhyming paul, the rhyming paul o Cairo.
Maybe.
Oh phew I thought you did not like them.
I will fall.
I can ask toka to find out.
I am at work.
I suppose.
You sound like an alarm clock.
I am going home.
Did you see the book detail screen?
But dinner.
I am off on thursday and friday.
I got angry and stressed and sad last night.
I bought some new tires and tubes so hopefully that helps a little too.
Mummy's flights were 340.
I do not listen to them.
Or will you just try to find love on a merry go round?
A breakfast bar?
What kind of cake?
Did you mean to make biscuits and they fell apart?
Cheeky.
And I am playing CrossCode
I am finding it harder and harder to wake up.
The heat cycles drove us crazy.
It happened very fast.
I have missing skin on my ankle, shoulder, and elbow.
I have mini pizzas and apple crumble.
The super market will be better.
Any email, any password.
Tendon maybe.
It is usually that price for a return.
Where are you.
And we were watching black mirror.
ages
There is only apple crumble.
Where are you.
I need medicine.
A corner that is too sandy because of the wind.
Just the handle bar tap.
*incoming*
They did.
a@a.com, 123456
Or the star for favourite.
Happy new year to you too.
I am sure the typing contributes too.
I am making apple crumble again.
I spent 30 minutes cleaning the oil pan so we can make chips.
But also modeling.
I miss your colourful clothes.
My Duolingo club exploded.
No, there are no nerves there.
200 orange juices.
If darktable does not work, search google for a free raw photo processor for windows 7.
The raw file is not a photo.
I fell off the bike.
Oh no.
I think they do.
The cat's anus triggered it.
What is your plan today?
I am not sure actually.
Not sure about hurghada though.
I am home.
darktable
No, it is your task.
The missing s is really bothering me.
And a fascist.
Wake up.
The male is much more relaxed.
fool, bananas, pears.
I just got the bike to the side, stuck the chain back on and kept going.
And my shoulder.
After the corner it lost grip and wobbled and threw me off.
Even the bike does not have much damage.
But I do not.
In the shower I came up with a scottish version.
My wrist hurts.
I think the vibrations in the handle bars are causing it.
I will head home.
The new version of darktable works on windows.
Where did you go?
With more oats and flour.
Are you having an identity crisis?
I am so hungry.
A car stopped, but I was okay.
Eating all the pizzas.
I am waiting for the paracetomol and ibu profen to work.
:(
I need to shower but I am too clothed and lazy.

I think so.
You look worn out.
I will be here soon.
I am here.
His medical license was revoked for sexual assaults.
Hmmm.
Remember the pen drive.
Thanks.
I am so tired.

I had doum, jalepeno, apple crumble, mini pizzas.
I am so so full.
Yes.
But cr2 is not an image.
Apple crumble Jesus.
But not really.
Did I miss you.
Are you an alarm clock.
But 2MiB is too small for a full size photo.
Yeah my head hit the ground but it was fine.
The ankle might swell, the rest is fine.
And I can not find a scratch on it.
What is.
Will you send you.
I will settle with a drawing of you.
Why am I so sleepy.
On the bottom or inside?
Phoronix benchmarked the fixes so far and I think said no change.
So our income is not 9500 a month.
Mariam, so woke.
He sells advice on how to pick up woman.
There are groups, but the costly thing is the prolapsing.
It is hyper as ever.
What did you do to 4am?
Did you find the best song?
The helmet did a good job.
My ankle, shoulder, elbow, and knee.
My ankle is really starting to hurt.
My helmet worked amazingly though.
But I have to wake up at 9am.
I am dozing off.
I will lay down.
She is going to have a hard time making money.
Yeah it was fine.
You know the place or have internet?
Google it still.
Our cat is costing a fortune with operations.
Try not to get a virus.
I fell off the bike.
After a sandy corner, it wobbled and I was thrown in front.
At about 30km/h.
And I have some missing skin in places.
It happened super quickly.
Oh I almost never bruise.
Ewww.
Will you stay up to 9am tonight?
The one man band is here.
It is Winter.
I wish it all the time.
Now good old fool.

In 15 minutes or less?
I have ME vunrabilities with no fixes published.
Which aparrently has the only waterfalls in egypt.
It is almost my weekend.
My ankle hurts now though.
Not yet.

I was pretending to be offended as a joke.
Fool.
Apple crumble.
Oh wow.
You can use the me checker.
I can stand on the balcony.

It is the weeeeeeeeeeeeeekeeeeeeeeeeeend
Lacking oxygen?
What is it?
Something to do with tables.
**CONRATULATIONS PAUL FOR REACHING THE WEEKEND**
And both being under the egyptian parent regime.
Was it that dissapointing.
I am cold and two showers a night is not permitted.
Rated well.
Are you studying yet.
The one furthest the elevator door, or on the right coming up the stairs.
I saw something about work being done.
I got the monnnney.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks RIOT!
The goverment does an inspection to check if the work itself is being paid the same, not the position.
I want to eat so much.
I woke up.
Have you googled it?
What.
Coffeeee.
I fell asleep.
I think my boss might arrange a fun day to fayoum for us.
My body hurts everywhere.
That is pretty cool.
Still, waiting for pay everyone the exact same policy.
I will order the remaining things tomorrow.
Lots should have arrived by now.
I give my daily wellbeing dairy in the voice not.
Bring heat.
And warm.
Hey wake up.
Good morning.
What is blue?
I imagine it can seem like that when it is a mostly remote relationship.
But I hope you never settle for less than perfection.
I have coffee.
What do you have?
Where did you go.
My hands are icecream.
I was just about to ask if you were sad.
How much money do you want this month?
Did you listen.
But are you warm.
You finally set a photo.
And the best ones use custom hardware.
No idea, he has not wiki page.
Never seen it before :/
The game looks funny.
"The legislation is basically a mechanism that companies and organisations ... evaluate every job that's being done, and then they get a certification after they confirm the process if they are paying men and women equally,"
It is black mirror night.
It just reaks daniel.
Hi.
Sore everywhere.
No, I cycled.
Are you fine today?
Sore everywhere, but otherwise fine.
No no no not dairy.
Will you go for a walk first?
Mariam I hope you are okay.
Or something else.
I was sore before.
Nots are what I send.
Put the shower at 100C. I go in the shower to heat up.
Did you listen to the first song I sent you today?
Do you prefer my voice messages or photos?
You have had 9 hours already.
Bitcoin uses gpus.
Yeah, the VR is optional I think.
Wake up wake up wake up.
Oh it worked.
Good morning.
I was securing my server a bit.
And playing crosscode.
Have you had breakfast?
I have an exam never.
Where did the summer go.
Where did the mariam go.
Where did my motivation go.
Why.
I think I need coffee.
Did you see this?
It has nothing on me because private trackers.
The statistics are interesting though.
And toka downloaded something last month when I found it and I saw it there.
I am making a huge pot of coffee.
I think a lot of lookups of ips are pretty inaccurate.
I do not try anymore though, not on 200KiB/s.
HDDs will not have the read speeds.
18 hours now.
And while you are at it, fix those damn cpus.
Bin bag sledges are all you need.
9.
I will soon.
Most played game: st.
apack, aunpack, als for shortcuts.
Hi.
I love you and hope you are always fine.
The phone is at 2%
What are you doing?
I would hope coffee is vegan friendly.
Look at you living it large having other people make your coffee.
I thought it was big, but then I remembered how big the pot I made at home each day was.
The place?
Some sites think my ip is in france.
Fucking transcodes.
But that is just bad.
When that happens, I think we will get good quality 4k.
I am really enjoying crosscode.
I measured, so they should be fine.
Tubes?
I wonder how many pc hours I have in 2017.
Cleaners should be efficient.
What I really want is someone to live in the house and do all the house work, and feed me.
Wonder what acat is.
Xom.
Nah, you could do it over night, right?
Lisa ordered them.
I think it is music time.
Our cleaner is a bit shit.
Jesus.
Why not just shell.
There are reserved spaces for countries though.
.wmv 4kb
50GiB for 1080p blu rays was big enough.
It should be around 150, 200GiB I imagine.
That is almost streaming...
Zelda had a pretty shitty climbing system I think.
You can open them all up.
Does he have an office shower?
Yeah.
Get a cleaner.
Neither me or toka can be fucked with the amount of work.
zip, jar, rar, ace, rpm, deb, ar, tar.xz, tar.*, lzip, 7z, lzma, bzip,, gzip.
Owned by the `atool` package, not sure if it is default.
The main command is aunpack which extracts files from an archive. Did you ever extract files from an archive, not checking whether the files were located in a subdirectory or in the top directory of the archive, resulting in files scattered all over the place? aunpack overcomes this problem by first extracting to a new directory. If there was only a single file in the archive, that file is moved to the original directory. aunpack also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.
It is fucking perl.
Only public torrents.
But the server is in frankfurt.
Yeah, they look significantly better.
It is because it is so generic.
You can climb anything.
There was a game about climbing last year.
With some basic equiptment.
equipment
Just fucking get it done.
Mariam I just had two cups of coffee and now I feel so happy.
I have no good reason.
I am warm, and I have Mariam, I am fed, and I have no reason. I just am.
What are the red things on the right?
If I go public it will be with BlackHardDickXxX 2160p NEW 2018
They made a bitrate that fits on blu rays.
Actually, 200GiB, not playable on a HDD, that is shit expensive storage requirements.
And now I know why I am happy.
But there is no standard for foot size.
Are you buying a car?
Oh that is large.
18 will take some time.
atool is an archive tool that works with pretty much any archive.
Waiting for me to fall so you can reply, I think.
I have mushrooms and onions to make a, wait for it... mushroom and onion sandwhich.
I found usually it was the bitrate being dick, or the camera just was not good enough.
That 50GiB is already compressed.
For Horizon?
When are you home.
Or she pays you.
Messing around with dmenu out of boredom.
I am happy.
And that is.
What about it?
Yeah, my bt ip was in london.
The person who owns the ip range can give you any of them.
200GiB in 1.5 hours though.
It was just a bar, and climb any surface, rain.
Uncharted was too linear with the climbing.
I am almost crying.
Pretty sure it will average around 11-13 hours a day.
Nah, it would be firefox.
As long as you like doing it.
I think you will like them colour of my toothbrush.
Oh no. I have fall on a good note.
Goodnight Mariak.
"It was nice to speak to you."
Not sure how that applies to companies who own spaces in multiple countries.
There is no standard for 4k video optical yet is there?
I am not sure what I would want from a climbing system.
But I think it would be somewhat resembling actual climbing.
Pfft, not my job.
Every manufacturer uses a different system.
Yes.
Pick a number between 10 and 20.
I think I have played that many games total in the last five years.
Yeah that is true.
Why have I never heard of this?
The cat was annoying too.
Did you sleep well?
My feet are not that big.
I will take a shower.
What is it.
Is it olas tonight.
But now I want fateer now.
Where do you get enough money for 23 ps4 games...?
I just memorized them all.
That is a weird note.
I think that might be everything.
But I still need to make an order.
Is it serious?
But they get the basics done really fast.
Just everything.
I deleted one so it is only 17 now.
Sleeping.
So I can sleep whenever.
Wake up.
man acat
<3
I think I slept 8.
They make my life difficult.
What did you do?
It is impossible to push in.
No idea.
Boot computers is still an issue.
There is OpenRISC.
If you want to read this and tlder me.
source code :D
Cycling trousers, ear plugs, cycling saddle.
Coffee, hot chocolate, orange jucie, and water is all I drink.
How do you sleep for so long.
But I never checked.
It leaves something in a cache.
You look so fancy. Fancy Mariam.
How long did you sleep?
I am going shopping to see if I can get things to make life easier.
Do we still have my scales from ikea?
So if theirs is easier, mine is.
To make your life easier.
Let me check.
The ones that are 64 bit or 128, RISC-V, SPARC, MMIX, and OpenRISC.
The rest have 32.
I think it would be a shit tonne of work.
I have to go to bed.
I really like today's photo.
It is being made now.
We got some better cat dishes for water and food.
It looks like a shitty tattoo.
Okay, but take 20.
Where will you go?
I think there is another architecture that is better for freedom.
fpgas are not vunerable to these attacks xom.
Okay now what.
I hope it is trivial.
Nowhere has a scratching post though.
Yeah, but the problem is with speculative execution.
And it is a simple instruction set.
All RISC.
MMIX has 256 registers which is balls fucking insane.
Did you listen.
Does she tell you to pull over, she rolls down the window and shouts, "lau somat, lau somat!". Then she orders some street socks without getting out the car.
As long as the face is big.
I have never touched video or audio in Android.
And think it is easy to copy.
** in realtime.
Just around.
With buffers.
And a cat carrier.
Efi sucks dick, bios is not used, and arm has no standard.
Oh wait, RISC-V and OpenRISC are both 2010.
Drive by shopping.
Maybe.
Otherwise I imagine you are going to get into the ndk.
I never sounded like that is is just a pretend Scottish accent.
A supermarket or chemist.
And a cat bed.
Oh nice.
I am so tired.
Flat and pretty small.
I need a trail period.
A mobile application?
I think there are plently of web libraries for webrtc though.
Will you be here?
Okay so voice hearing time.
Mariamazon.
I am waiting for Duolingo.
Straight after work?
Always the best.
I got the moneeey.
And a cat toy.
I just put coco powder and sweetal together.
I want to see your face.
It is too far out, it just squishes.
I am sure it can be fixed, but I think arm, amd, etc have said it is possible on their cpus.
They can just reprogram.
******INCOMING*******
This is a pretty good summary of the whole thing.
I think you look too sad in that one.
Doom is when there is no hope and everything will be bad.
We do not eat or have it.
Can I order Mariam from Amazon?
And arm license out their architecture or something.
So, the only open and royalty free architectures are: micro32, risc-v, sparc, MMIX, and OpenRISC.
The oldest being SPARC, then newest, RISC-V.
RISC-V has variable instruction encoding.
Is this going to be the new avatar?
I will be here in 15ish minutes I think.
Are you home yet.
It's anus is out and it is disgusting and puts blood and shit everywhere.
Or a curse.
Or something.
Like splenda I suppose.
I only know super basics.
A sugar alternative.
Yeah, I need a relaxing break.
The cabin pressure has burst my pens I took before.
He said today.
I am sure there must be a reddit about open hardware.
I have no idea what to do.
They want to recreate the facebook live streaming.
Oh but I will fall soon.
Goodnight Mariak <3
Oh I am so hungry.
Only baroody is here so far.
Milk in any drink tastes bad.
Nope, I only like coco+sweetner, and coffee+nothing.
And baked food each night.
Remind me to measure my sit bones tonight.
Yeah, I used to have a client that was online all the time.
I am off home.
I have olas.
But it might be practical to use WebRTC.
I think no java code could ever be fast enough for it.
Probably, if you send a few.
I am doomed.
I am happy it did.
Yeah not long.
What...?
And a clean flat finally haha.
Actually, we need to look up if it is safe to take pens on a flight.
Are you still alive?
Magdsoft is the best.
Where did she go?
Did you listen.
You are going to have to rearrange.
But everyone hates webviews.
Maybe just github search for it.
You are going to have to excuse me.
Desert fruit.
Okay.
And if it is in luggage, then the pressure is even worse.
Could someone pick me up some Tweezerman or Rubis stainless steel point tweezers?
One boil means one bubble?
Pfft I only like my planck now.
Not on me.
Yeah and how often does the second surgery suceed, how often does the first fail.
I am so sleepy.
Metro Station really went downhill.
Merry christmas v2.
See what they say.
6$/hour, that is ball expensive.
WebRTC is a direct connection, it is serverless.
I can reply in the morning though.
Yeah okay, goodnight for now.
I am here.
Oh.
She will be telling you having a child is the only true solution next.
You can google that medicine she told you about and see if any of the active ingredients match up with any of the listed antifungal creams mentioned in these.
I have tomorrow off.
Wake up.
She ate this morning.
I would hold out for crosscode because the story is not complete.
I was just showing and shaving my head.
I am ten times more tired now.
I must sleep.
Okay.
I am not offilne.
Now I stopped using it.
10/10.
No but seriously it is fine.
Was she aware that you have had it before, and had treatment for it?
You need to know how to research.
It is the egyptian christmas day aparrently.
Then I heard the bloop.
It is no work.
I think you have a shit load of work ahead of you.
Wake up.
THE BETTER
The ones on amazon seem to be dodgy, refurbished some say.
The sharp pointy end ones, not the slanted ones.
I will have to.
Never a problem.
When you show me the big money, and can prove the big money keeps rolling in, then I will consider it.
I have double coffee.
And I am off.
But the 4 dungeons are fucking massive puzzle/combat challenges.
Shaven.
Yeah.
Have you searched for 'alternatives to wowza'?
I am never offline.
Heating up the olas now.
diflucan
I think so.
I had a triple hot chocolate.
Shit no.
So be awake.
At least they feel long.
Okay I have a shiny head.
But you should make sure the client is aware of the costs.
You have to contact them to get a quote though.
1 streamer for 5 hours is 5.
2 streamers for 5 hours is 5.
Tonight?
You are going out.
Nah, no one owes me shit.
Remember to send your face.
The treatment course is the latest recommendation by the CDC.
Call them and say you forgot to mention to me and that she last ate an hour ago.
Transcoding to multiple formats is not something even twitch affords for < 100 viewers.
The content delivery sure, because you need a server, and this api saves you from the hassle of setting up a server and webservice.
Ah no, iris is not self hosted, it has plans.
Per hour, per stream.
Then?
I hope you are not tearing.
Except that is horrible.
So ignore it.
I swapped a song with number 4.
Went to youtube and searched freeman uk.
The us version.
No causing harm to others.
Are you fine?
I am, but you have my voice diary so it will tell you better.
I am too tired.
Still.
They seem smaller and less transparent.
It is what you want.
Upload one stream, pass it to everyone.
Our cat has the operation tomorrow.
And there was no sunflower spread.
Other than those, I see my rss, and that is it.
As long as nothing urgent is happening.
You should express concern that it might happen again.
Crazy eyes just crawled inside my jumper.
Are you home yet.
I put the rest in the fridge.
fluconazole,
It is the second christmas.
They are going to be pissed if they open her up to find shit and it is unoperaple.
What do you have?
As in always has been?
And video encoding is not a trivial computation for a moblie.
It is 1.50USD per ten hours of streaming.
Iris looks like you need to set it up on your own server.
I think.
Where did he go?
I want heat, and food, and heat.
I hope I eat food.
Okay it is finally time to cook.
The onions smell delish.
No they follow natural laws.
Or mischief.
They both circle jerk.
I had some yes.
You should spend some time researching the fungus and treatment yourself.
So you do not have to trust me.
I am awake.
A bit stagnent.
I will be half an hour.
I think you need ondevice encoding and a middle server that sends the video to all the other devices.
Is the client in the middle east?
Shall we order tofu tonight?
Are you coming home or just going straight out?
This does not sound nice.
Oh god this is Amenah and Ash all over again.
Wish me a beautiful hannah and shiva.
I ate but it was not the best best.
It is only 4 hours.
And we are talking about shit being in the operation place.
Yes.
Because you are going to have to use really high compression to get video uploading in real time.
But there may be similar ones for cheaper.
Which would be much cheaper, but more work.
per hour.
I doubt they charge for downloading of the stream.
Where did you go.
No.
I think you are right.
I always do.
My work is pretty flexible.
5pm.
This freeman is being arrested and taken to court because he will not provide his name or address for a court summit because he has no driving license, insurance, mot, etc.
It better.
Are you sure you keep waking up?
I am home.
Are you here today?
Where on our street.
They may reject it.
The service I think will help you a lot.
10 users uploading video per hour will be 1.50usd an hour.
hours, yes.
Yeah, uploaded time.
2 streamers for 5 hours each is 10 hours is 10.
Oh no.
I am so so hungry.
I thought they were perfect, they were long distance, and then it ended after some difficulties.
No I am not that big.
I only see haiku.
I saw a video from reddit about a sovereign citizen.
They seem very closely related to social justice warriors. Just more cookoo.
Fucking sjws.
Probably.
I do not think you need live transcoding.
Ah, the api has no transcoding too at 0.15$ an hour.
I am super hungry now.
So it is time.
Oh wow, where is he.
What is going to happen.
I want tofu.
Is it soon.
The mushrooms and bread were just not good.
I am getting hooked watching videos of them.
They are so confidentily retarded.
**unsubscribe**
You should see the trump one.
Yes, of course.
He is about to fall apart in court.
Wowza seems better.
In a circle, jerking each other off.
Both groups think they can outsmart a lawer.
I think I associate it with a gang of people who would punch a baby in the face and then scream at someone for jaywalking.
Or stab a homeless person then harass the police officer about freedom of speech rights.
No one would care.
You will what me?
I mean you can have as many as you want, but it is 0.15usd per stream.
Mushrooms and onion then :(
Was it nice?
I have not had anything since breakfast.
Did you listen to yesterdays message yet?
I ate, but it was not as tastey as I hoped.
Okay.
Running dry on videos.
I was pretty funny, the guard gave no shits, and tased him in the court reception.
The topics can be legit, like feminism.
I do not like having many accounts.
It is 10 minutes walking.
I am home, but I have to head out again.
Did you get good results?
It ended.
There are loads of videos of these crazy people who think the law is a mutual contract.
Both group themselves together tightly, and reinforce their own ideas to stupid levels.
Sure there are huge differences.
When are your possible hours?
This is a video he himself uploaded.
If you are in.
More entertaining to read I think.
With that mode they wait for items to group together before sending out.
I always check to see if the order can be fufilled by amazon before adding to basket.
Yeah, I am fine with that.
I do not know.
Okay.
They both deal with social issues.
The similarity I see is the ranting about rights, that they have a flimsy understanding of.
That last usage was a joke though.
I can list my subreddits.
I love iamverysmart.
I doubt it.
I woke up.
Lossiemouth.
Hi.
I am leaving in a moment.
I need to go home then pick the cat up from the vet.
I have to wait to record another.
Okay I think it is fool time.
They circle jerk each other off inside their own social system.
Have you not seen the video of the ukranians smashing homeless people's skulls in with hammers?
Yeah she would hate ice on her ass.
Better yet, a scots bible that is a joke rather than a translation.
She went to the bedroom so I put her under the blanket then put pillows around the outside of the bed in case she jumps.
Toka will be back by 9 I think.
I am worried you will not rant.
How big?
There were just steps.
I sometimes think of how things could be different.
I was kind of hoping your mum looked like old Mariam.
Positive feedback loop.
You might be right.
But they approach it like a jackass.
I have no idea where you see the term so much.
I am.
When is the cleaner.
A scots bible should be pretty funny.
What the fuck.
Took a day or so for free to arrive with 6 items.
Did you tell them to group objects into as few as possible deliveries?
I am home.
I keep puting her back in the bed.
What are you doing?
I think I will have fool until you are here.
Are you up to date on voice messages.
Tell them to yalla.
When are you home?
I mean, I could leave work early.
I really can not believe he exists.
You could come when you finish, we go for a walk, and then I just work later.
I will head home.
Prolapsing is not normal.
She is trying to walk but can not.
I am so so hungry.
I think it was a different vet.
And he is saying, "I am happy to get out of the car, but I do not work for free".
He charges 20,000gbp to leave the car.
The police officer signs his bill xom.

They could have given up on one delivery. after a while.
Sometimes the seller is lazy and delays by weeks.
You never swear.
Really drowsey.
Hmmm still not close.
I will get into bed.
Okay be fine.
Cars cars cars
The kitchen is horrible.
I never had that last week.
It is like she is in a bouncy castle.
But yeah.
I am super hungry.
I am still not changed, washed, or fed.
People should not be allowed to own two houses when there are people who do not have houses.
And inheritence too.
I decided to listen to it before replying but now I have no idea what to reply to.
You still have not shown me your parents.
I mean I was joking with the month.
Are you not here?
Are you ready for your long slumber?
How are you?
Get up.
A bit.
I got a new smaller neck cone though.
Pretty bad English.
Mansoura is the country side?
Do you mean in real life or this life?
Maybe, I am not sure when toka is home.
I got achievements on the duolingo website.
Because I hate private housing.
You should not be allowed to inherit property.
Wait, you had a queue?
I think studying is the worst, out of a lot of things in my life, feeling like you have to study otherwise you will fail, it was one of the worst things.
I never found anything complicated.
In different ways.
I am missed.
English teaching jobs in China are super common.
Come back.
When are you home.
As in, what did I do yesterday?
Or if different things or people happened.
Although, I might be scared to see them.
Like clicking.
32 would be good.
I am missing some hours.
Okay I am going to leave.
21 more injections :(
When will they go?
The other cat is sleeping on me.
I hope this is the last.
Who got it from their parents.
Did you not rant.
Oh it is here.
But I will be here again in 15-20 minutes if you will.
I can give a review next month.
I just do not sleep as much as I want.
It is.
An hour ago.
I am ordering 200 pairs or something.
Who is nour?
Why does it say go team?
Wake up.
Slowly falling.
What do we eat tonight?
Okay any of those.
I will shower and drink.
We have people who can not work because they own enough stuff.
You know I am a communist.
I skipped the tutorial, not sure if the sense of discovery will be worth it.
Why am I so sleep Mariam.
I do not know what is complicated with you two.
Have you tried ear plugs?
I hate noise so much.
Yes.
But she does not.
It won some subreddit game award of the year.
The genre of incremental has really died now.
I do Duolingo.
I am falling.
Goodmorning Mariam.
I think I will stay late today instead.
If you yalla yallasten, I will yallacord.
Me three.
I was much happier after finishing.
But my life is now, so I should concentrate on now.
My expectations of a rant were way off.
I am on a 31 day streak.
Goodnight Mariak.
Hmm maybe.
I am home.
Digestive biscuits.
Wait, you can come home and we can decide in a bit.
I want hot chocolate now.
I only started tonight.
There are some short nice games though.
Be here soon.
Work as usual.
No, but I have been going to work late the last few days.
I have struggled to get out of bed this week.
Oat cakes.
I am clean.
Are you going to bring all the food tomorrow?
Yalla.
When when when.
I am back.
I am foll of fuul now.
I almost just finished the fool.
It sounds like you need a new cleaner.
This was just normal.
I really wish there were more hours in a day.
Okay.
Any one who breaks road rules.
Where is your face.
No no replace the chips with something else.
Maybe that is a good place for it.
The one with oats in it.
You can tell nour to study in the bathroom.
Nada.
Yeah every agrees on the shit elements these days.
I steal toka's phone.
I will sleep.
Working late tonight.
I am kind of bored of doing android stuff now though.
I think I will stay one more hour.
They are putting people's life at risk.
And tell the shop keeper I said hi.
And that I need my money, prompto.
But I want that chocolate bar.
Do yo want to order something.
I will make some hot chocolate.
This room is sub zero.
I expected you to be mad at something.
I am here.
It is okay.
I had koshary.
Kareem bought me koshary.
Do not surcumb to the junk.
Ginger berad.
bread
Hmmmm.
They are cheap hob nobs.
How far is that from where you live?
Hmm okay.
Maybe bring noodles and juice too.
Driving where?
When will you assure me.
Good evening.
I am still at work.
I am going home.
I give many drivers the middle finger.
This photo is nice.
That is last minute.
Oh that is far.
Dying for the noodles.
Taxi drivers are some of the worst drivers.
I should shower and drink.
Ginger is sleeping her bed by herself.
Oh yes.
When are you home?
A -1 class.
Yeah.
Good morning.
:(
Well the poop went back in.
It is just the latest version of the app I am working on.
Not yet.
No you should face your students.
I think I do the same thing every day.
Where is the tofu.
Hmmmm.
The kitchen balcony right?
It is not a bad idea.
And I peed twice.
I might go to carrefour with kareem tomorrow if you want anything.
I am home.
Hello.
Did you listen to the last voice message?
Is every day the same?
Okay photocopy it.
What are they?
It looks like coconut.
I know rich and rich.
Oh you said you will assure me tomorrow after the exam.
Oh no.
I need to poop and pee but there is no water.
You get to buy and hack servers and augment yourself.
2MiB/s.
I have automated a lot now.
It is a lot like javascript.
$1.3B
To get dressed, go out side, walk.
I do really love breakfast though.
If you want to come over with breakfast, and write hacking scripts, that is fine.
scan
A what?
Or hob nobs.
Any oat based biscuit.
I do not see many oats around these parts.
I want flapjacks.
I am so tired.
It is rest time.
Tomorrow for sure though.
This is my hack script :D
Why is it so cold.
Hmmm, well it is complicated.
It takes a while.
I am not focusing too much on stuff.
Well, there is an augmentation stat.
I really think you underestimate how lazy I am.
Did you wake up.
Could you get extra noodles.
What if? You already assured me.
Do you want to see the app I am doing?
The buttons I hate though.
Same here.
Hacking level is 268 right now.
When you apply them, you reset your stats.
Toka will get crepes on the way home.
I noodled up.
Good morning.
It is frozen though.
15 minutes to magdsoft.
I just really hate going outside.
Does the client not know how many $s they can make with hacking scripts?
Does he even know my hacking level?
Why would I want to hack?
It hurts a little.
Yeah we have you covered.
The water came back.
So when are we really meeting?
So ready to sleep.
Are you fine?
No, waiting for fool to defrost.
I skipped it, but sure.
I have 1TiB of ram on my home now.
If had that much energy, I would just walk to the bakery.
It is bleeding.
I just cleaned all my computer stuff.
Pick a number between 8 and 15.
Oh wow.
Not yet.
You will need this.
It did take me a day or two to get into it.
No idea.
It is way too much effort.
And how much I hate outside.
home takes you home
So:
But it looks less neat.
I am putting on mega coffee and going to super organize the computer stuff and wires.
Cold and sleepy.
Found this guy in youtube live chat.
What is your speed over there?
But keep your server.
Jeez I am hugrny.
I am playing a game where you have to program to win.
I have been playing this game.
Fool needs to turbo defrost.
I wish I had a breakfast delivery of fool, ta3meya, etc every morning.
Nah, my home is a work free zone.
And arrays with different types, are converted to objects in javascript.
Are you ready for them to never see 4k content?
You have to write scripts to hack things.
Was there no change from the noodles, orange juice, and crepe?
I found a workaround for globals.
I bashed my nail with a dumb two pin power plug.
See if you can beat my scripts :D
Just making money with hacking.
Once I have a killer upgraded home computer, and automated money, I will start upgrading myself.
So last night.
The one annoying thing with the language is globals are read only.
Objects are not supported.
But arrays are.
So I would know where to go.
I need the mega dose.
What were you crying about?
Where are you.
I do not eat chicken though.
Are you alive?
WHERE IS MY ROASTED CORN.
That was one long dream.
Planning to tonight.
I just got home.
But I was there.
What else happened?
I am hungry.
Had a good laugh at this.
Number, I need a number.
1.50gbp.
I did not have time to refine and order it yet though.
Where are you.
I am here.
The cats woke me up and I am struggling to sleep.
No.
Just until I get sleepy.
I do too.
Did the playlist end?
Even unordered.
Am I making you mix tapes?
When are your exams finished.
What is it for?
I think go out.
You have your emergency lights on?
So I had to include it.
I ate so much corn I am ashamed.
I woke up.
95% usa.
This is exciting.
**MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM**
I thought the oven was closer to the microwave.
I think you are hiding from me.
I am dressed.
Do you have enough money?
I will eat until I explode.
I am fine, just been working. The cat had to have the operation repeated so that has been a nightmare.
Now cats outside are fighting.
I feel like I can never see you.
I will open a gallery of Mariam.
The arm is weird.
Right now?
And if I do not repsond, know I will within that time.
No.
I am here.
I will come to you after pooping.
You know so many people, I can not trust any of them because I do not know them.
25?
I do not know why.
Oh my god.
** in oil
I have all the samboosa.
Running?
Toka got 68% british.
96% with my English accent.
Crazy eyes is sleeping in the bed.
With ginger.
I am making porridge.
I am already eating it.
Tupperware.
If your hair is like this I will faint.
I can not.
It does not exist.
For how long?
Do you want to come in, or I will go out?
The boss is not here yet :D
But work comes after Mariam.
The ones I got were 37.
What is your minimum sleeping requirements?
We have two sofas, but also we have so many big pillows we made lisa a bed out of them.
TONIGHT
Did I tell you I played gone home?
Okay.
Hesus.
Where are you.
Nah, our oven takes forever.
Uh oh, I feel like any moment you will sleep for another 18 hours.
This is for the earring things.
I am ordering some things now.
Well it would not be unwelcome.
Jesus.
Okay having breakfast now.
Looks silver.
Yeah.
Hurry home.
If they like me, and they do not annoy me, I like them, and I hope I do not annoy them.
I am at work.
You can ask her about it.
I did.
Do you like roasted corn?
What chillis do you eat these days?
Open to no one.
I will make trail mix for each day in them.
A painted one.
Did you ever see my longer hair?
Why do you like the picture?
Am I keeping you awake.
Hold on.
The voice sample is from the game 'Gone Home' which I really liked.
I keep getting little moments to browse for things.
I was going to boil them.
I never got them.
I have rich and riches.
I am home.
Only the porridge.
Do you have enough for coffee and orange juice?
What?
Everything should arrive before the 22nd, most stuff before the 20th.
Not ore, it is too mundane.
I mean I find it impossible to imagine.
No no come for a while.
Okay I might have breakfast around that time.
Okay.
If you get out the car you should see me.
So all the trust goes into you.
WHAT IS IN THE BAG JOHN?
I just know I act the same way with people I have not met much before.
I am too hungry.
I feel quite comfortable.
No.
I could be mega.
The porridge is in the oven.
Finished it now.
Hi.
I am becomming worried.
Out of Bounds
I just witnessed how your computer turned itself off.
I got some really nice little tubs.
Oh you have probably seen loads.
Goodnight Mariak.
On your right.
I think it takes time to associate the physical you with the this you.
I am here.
This song.
These jalapenos are not spicey enough any more.
Okay I will go cook them.
Might do another small order though.
Oh I thought it was a sonbrello.
Hla's hair has become humongous.
Slewp de doop.
It lasts about 10-15 minutes.
Hahaha no.
So it conflicts.
It was the best to see you.
When are you in work today?
My rules are pretty simple.
Oh god I need the bag.
Are you here.
What no?
What will you be fine sleeping on?
They will sleep with us probably.
Well, I will last until I am home.
I am home.
How can I wait.
The apple cookies.
I will try to make porridge.
Gone for 17 hours.
This is preposterous.
Porridge is in the oven.
No.
Yeah, but requires more taken care.
So message me when you are near.
I think I see you.
Up and back.
WHERE IS THIS SO CALLED BAG?
It is at work with you.
I am craving more.
Wake up.
When are you home?
I will tell you when I know about deliverys.
Are you home yet.
Any thoughts on food?
Did your dad find any fingerprints?
Where are you.
Will you be here at 1am?
Wake up.
Hey that is near where I live.
Hmm, that link looks the same.
From more than five years ago.
Where did you go.
Okay I will sleep too.
I just opened riot and it was in 2016 which nude pictures.
No idea.
I will come to the balcony.
No photo yet.
But I know I know you a lot.
The power keeps going off.
I am listening to Sleeping Through for the first time.
I mean when are you home.
Going to try to make some soya milk and oats today.
I was just thinking of how hungry I was then I remembered my corn.
RIGHT
Are you sleeping?
Can I eat all the samboosa?
Too expensive.
What do you want?
I am excited.
By consuming something **MEGA**
I just had a shower for almost an hour.
Did you go back to sleep.
Going to remove it.
Nandtech
flizz sounds rude.
I would say I miss you but I missed just after you left.
Are you sure you did not mix up with the sleeping pills?
It is quite empty when you are not here.
Okay.
I will go buy food.
I am waiting for my oat bar though.
It looks big enough for two trousers.
Oh wow, I never noticed back then.
Are you any better?
Yeah I see.
Heating up.
Ginger was trying to stay stood up and awkwarldy standing there.
I am not convinced I am done, so we can make a second order.
Xception
Are you compensating for when you could not sleep?
So take a seat, for what you are about to witness will be quite a feat.
Hey, that sounds good. I am sure her excitement will die down as we get to the pyramids.
I think if people throw bricks at your car, you do not stop, you speed up.
And she came to magdsoft and it scared her.
Mariam.
When will you be home?
But noodles when you come home is fine.
Are you okay?
Xorflip.
What have you been doing?
Peanut butter, but that might be weird.
Something that can not be beat.
Good morning.
Where is the photo?
I really want to move to tagama though.
I just avoid people.
Yeah, but at this point, driving away still seems way safer than stopping and let those people catch you.
Roast vegetables,
Okay super roasted.
Do you think I will ever give up trying to wake you up?
I am really tempted to try to program a deep neural network.
Leaving in a negative bit.
Estimated delivery:  24 Jan. 2018 - 13 Feb. 2018
Okay I ordered 7 things.
Did you listen to my message?
Okay I have all the food.
But hopefully she will be perfect after the stitches are removed.
Hmmmmm, well ish.
It is only 1.8km from me.
Just opposite the big electronics shop.
Unsafe because it was too quiet?
I found those dogs are not violent because the kids play with them.
Grabbed ginger by the neck with both paws, and started falling back down while licking her head.
Though that sounds like a nand manufacturer.
Did you drive the car to the middle of the dessert and set it on fire, then walk home?
When.
A treat for the senses.
Ah not much yet.
Crazy was on his back and did a sit up.
Null
Ginger stood on the off button.
Like the internet light goes off?
Does it happen a lot?
Just oats would be good.
Hahahaha.
Mariam mariam mariam mariam mariam.
I am super hungry.
The router keeps disconnecting?
And for long?
Sticking snow?
I see photos of the place she lives and it looks amazing.
It is my job as a spy to worry about that.
Why?
I will eat until we meet.
It was not too bad last time we went.
But yeah 4-8 weeks seems to be the right period to book any flights.
Where exactly?
My friend lives in the diplomat district.
I have no idea.
Yeah.
But I hate street dogs.
Yeah Ben mentioned it was heavy, he never took a photo though.
No photo?
Where is it this time?
Yeah, I pass it on the way to sheraton.
Are you done studying.
You left the left window open from the left without a net.
But reheated is bad.
And home.
Ginger walked up to crazyeyes who was in the bed.
Digital ocean just doubled my server ram.
The doubled pretty much everything for the same price.
Also, they are going to move to billing by the second later this year.
Which is pretty crazy.
I am really worrying now.
Did things happen?
It seemed to happen so quick from my perspective.
Yalla and finish the exam.
I have my mega coffee.
10 days
It is porridge time.
I am about to make porridge at work.
No, I left the porridge from yesterday.
Also, **HELLO**.
Does she realise the consequences of posting this?
She said is started before that.
Which is not useful.
I see posts like that on her twitter a lot.
When she did first mention it.
Hello.
This is my mood now.
The words on your mind do not belong in the public.
25 is still a month away.
The only thing I see wrong with you is you spend far far too much time scrolling through social media.
This blog helped me a lot in the past.
You should take the 2110 and make a shoping cart on amazon.
Now, because you have a problem.
Why would not living be better than your life?
I do not know.
For fuck sake, why is she posting it publically to the world.
Everyone will blame me for this.
About an hour ago.
Number -100: do not make that post on social media.
I do not believe she is depressed.
Well, it is not fine.
B. If it is not a trend, then it is still serious.
"I don't know"
Paul, I think I have depression or something, but I'm not okay.It's been like that for so long, before any problems or arguments.And it's getting worse, I'm always thinking about dying.
Do you want to respond to the previous messages?
And not only them, maybe I should believe you when you say it is not me, but when you say that, I will think it is me.
How do you feel towards him?
Did she talk to you?
I am back.
I asked her why but she just said she does not know.
If it gets you points on social media...?
But life is empty, and you have to find things to do.
The search itself is more valuable than doing nothing.
I think we are all at work.
Are you finished.
It feels like that here.
I think I have no idea what happened.
Reem told you.
Why.
It would destroy me.
Am I that bad?
I think you should force your self into bordom so you find things you like.
Take away what you currently do and have, and you will find replacements that will be new and different.
Love you.
Maybe stop with social media and find something that does not just pretend to reward you.
Hello?
Wait, I changed my mind.
She said has been agaes.
It is damaging to others.
And everyone else who sees it is going to blame me.
Yalla break, this feels like eternity.
I forgot how much you said
One moment, I will be back.
Maybe likes to think she is.
I think I will need help here though.
Shoulds do not matter here, they will, because that is what happens when you post that.
Because anxiety exists.
Why did you do it though.
op
No causes, no feelings, no history, no desires.
When do you finish today?
Are you here?
Can we?
Do you have your own office?
2000?
Like reading is really boring, but you feel good after it.
Also books change you.
You have to answer why you are thinking about dying.
She just popped it on me too.
Maybe, but you can not ignore a boy who cries depression.
No my point is to be bored, to force change.
I know you want to leave Egypt, but I think you think this is some time of magical portal to a perfect world.
I know you want to go out more, to cycle more, to go places.
I do, but I am always here anyway.
I do not need anything, I want things.
I just want a list of things that will make you happier.
What the hell.
Number one: never die.
Maybe stop working six days.
A. If it is a trend, it is not okay to exercise it.
I have my sister asking me why you want to die.
Can you not talk at all to me before it gets to this stage?
I think it is affecting you badly.
om
Have you put a wall in front of me?
You can not pretend like there is nothing.
Can we talk to lisa?
It will not be a call.
This is what she said to me.
Will you be here forever please.
Say no if you want.
Can we make a group chat,
How could you manage to keep everything from me until now?
This is my point about forcing bordem.
Do you promise.
I am waiting for her reply.
That is a case for the computer above it.
This sounds like a roller coaster.
Do you want to see me?
Are you up to date with voice messages?
Declaring to the world you want to die has bigger consequences than I think you thought about.
And energy leaves after 20.
This is the whole list?
You shout depression and suicidal desires then tell me nothing.
Good morning.
And I think you do it because you have nothing else to do.
Once you hit crazy levels of bored, you start trying things you would never normally try.
<3
Make a list for me.
It is my weeeeeekend.
Where is your face.
Did you also break up with me for the last week?
Did you give the cats hyper pills?
No one wants to leave bed.
I will be home at 8:30pm.
You are not a brick.
Hello.
I am super hungry.
You can open it up.
Come in.
How am I expected to wait for noodles.
Why is your face so soft and mine is freckly, hairy, and my chin is destroyed.
Lisa took a huge shit last night.
I just got home.
Okay so here is the super rare self portrait of me.
She came on riot bragging about it.
Yeah it is called Mr Saniflow.
I will leave work soon.
Oh you look so nice.
Yeah, but I am not sure you have curly hair.
The suspense.
Where did you go.
**Hi**
What should I have for breakfast?
Nothing yet.
Toka joined last night.
But maybe wait until saturday or sunday.
Just carrots? Do I look like a rabbit?
I could make porrigde.
But I have to have coffee after porridge.
They just go so well.
Oats and soya milk and sweetner heated up to become kind of soggy.
I will take a photo.
Today you can make photo requests **FOR FREE TODAY ONLY GET THEM WHILE THEY LAST**.
No, it is the camera.
I am at the error correction stage, but I think I need to look up the math for that.
I asked if you keep your face in plastic to keep it so fresh.
I set this up.
Where are you.
And in the case?
I got cashews.
I will in a bit.
I have chocolate cornflakes.
I can cycle all the way fast, without much effort any more.
Nintendo found a way to sell cardboard to childen...
Fine I think.
It is not swept away.
And I can just host a file on the computer with these terms.
They have been in place for years.
hahahaha
But I am okay.
Yeah.
I notice my self getting fitter.
I wish the sun would come in the flat though.
So your friend has a nice perfect fishing rod and yours is a grubby peice of shit made out of paper.
Not talk about it.
Thick socks only.
You do not leave germany airport though.
If it looks messy, sorry.
But food laying out? Do you want flies?
Is that how you keep your face so fresh?
I started writing a deep neural network in golang.
It always interested me but I never thought about trying the hurdle.
Food always has a best before date. It is wrapped in plastic so it will not get flies and go foosty.
Does it go bad?
Ohhhh.
Why?
Was it fmt.Println("Hello paul!")
70usd
When she came home she was fine.
Okay.
Any thoughts on food?
Cold.
I had porridge, but when I saw the oats I wished I had chocolate cornflakes.
Oh, pretty sure that was not part of the order, but oh well.
How old is she now?
I made little snack boxes for work.
A beta?
It would save a lot of space.

Good morning.
Your kitchen is much nicer than ours.
Never.
The process will be completely automated too, it is just fucking cutting and printing cardboard.
Is it shower time?
It was too late, I made the milk.
guitar hero cardboard version
18 max, 6 min.
Letus see.
You have so many messages to reply to.
380 for a kg us robbery.
Cashew nuts cost 14gbp/kg here.
I noticed the chocolate cornflakes and instantly regretted making the porridge.
Did you have a stroke while writing that?
Only
That is too many programmers.
Nah, go is the only thing I enjoy writing.
Here is a warmer, cleaner face.
Yeah, the other thing that arrived is the case.
Toka is anxious that you will bring up what happened in private with her.
A tooth brush.
I only got an eighth.
Yeah I think there is no restrictions outgoing.
Only to the EU.
You better be here in a bit.
When is the best before date?
The best before date of your face.
Nope.
And she just started her period.
Be back.
Yeah I know that.
Very cold I would say.
Ah okay I will think.
A hundred pairs?
Dicks and forks.
A timed demo you have to play for 50 hours to finish?
How are you?
It looks fine.
Knex support would be cool.
I woke up.
I want to see the size of that computer inside the case.
It is smaller than the hand.
No insulation or heating.
I should have ordered more.
How many did I order?
Oh I will put some oil on it.
What was the cake for?
I think I might have to get you to take a huge bag across :O
I think four.
1 million static contexts
Where is the sun going.
Jumpers for the whole time.
I sleep in a jumper, long johns, and my onesie.
What happened yesterday.
What else could I add?
You never showed me the ear plugs.
Oh wow, it is pretty big.
Yeah, they have no ear plugs here and they are expensive when they do.
Wake up.
Exporting your data in an open standard format to transfer to other data holders.
Remember before the current directive? It was near impossible to delete accounts.
No longer opt-out shite.
It has to be where they are willing to lose all EU customers.
But as soon as you can affect things, you must be accountable for it.
Yeah, it works.
I have every video bookmarked in rss.
I napped.
Okay, I can photo.
It has a date, a date roll thing, a peice of doum, some salted roasted corn, some peanuts, 2 almonds, 2 cashew nuts, 2 walnuts, 2 bits of carab, 3 hazelnuts, some sunflower seeds,  some raisons, and a peice of cinnamon.
Okay then drive here.
Anything a server uploads to my computer, the server owner grants a license for me to reproduce and sell.
And say inside it, by transferring data to this computer, you agree to these terms.
This is not a directive, it is a regulation.
Okay be back.
It should be nationalized.
But then censorship is an issue.
Oh but what happens if there are nazis online with their real identities.
Have any asian horror recommendations?
I need coffee, my face feels droopy.
Could I not claim my computer is a service provider, that tracks statistics about about other servers something.
The whole fucking thing is stupid.
Which could be an issue if we start making apps that EU citizens would actually use.
Data controllers must be able to prove "consent" (opt-in) and consent may be withdrawn
They could just straight up sell and collect any data.
Having those boxes there is too tempting.
It seems crazy it is only a week away.
You are so quiet.
And these people I never help or stay in contact with.
I think because we contact each other without need of anything, this is why it is good.
You could take them all out and put them in a single bag or something.
You gave them the hyper pills again.
I can only hope it is mv, not cp.
So Big Ups to my Main Boi EU.
I can request fucking anything.
But forget that, what if.
Google seem to be so fucking stingey with youtube.
Nah, I think being annonymous comes with being silent.
OH.
It is too noisy here.
Things like this: anything you upload you grant us a license to do x.
Can the reverse not be true?
What will I eat?
Obviously, if they set the rate to 200%, google would refuse.
Just run it as a service to humanity.
I suppose it is fine because as soon as they target you they could be reported.
When is the **ETA** I am super super hungry.
When you do not want to do something but have no other excuse, say mmmmmmmm.
Scratch all that, it is nonsense, probably.
Upload videos for free, or apply for a job as a video creator.
Yeah, if you want to speak in public, I think you should be forced to accept the consequences of what you say.
And you are a jew.
Did anything arrive.
Which friends are you having sushi with?
Rich friends, because sushi is extortionate.
It is the definition of playing with food.
Porridge I think.
I will leave to go home very soon.
Yeah, the company I work at does not even follow the current legislation.
There must be a line where the company is willing to pay the fine.
Hello.
I will hear when I get home.
Are you here today?
I want her to be able to lick her self.
Then an ice cream sellar at 15.
<3
People make their own choices. But if they are making them to receive thank yous, I am not so sure about their intent.
I had my box.
Hahaha.
Are you busy enjoying yourself.
But what.
Leave me 10000 messages for the morning.
Are you home today?
But hello.
The new privacy law for the EU will be interesting.
4% increase on income, I think they could do it.
Also, can the EU just fucking make youtube2 and pay content creators?
A quick test to see if you are human every hour would be better than ads every 5 minutes.
How did she react to other cats?
Is everyone jealous of your box.
You do speak too close to the microphone though.
Then do it is the most miserable way possible so they never ask you again.
After like 12, I just had to wait until christmas.
Then in university I just had a huge loan.
I think I am not grateful for anything. I am just happy I have things.
They are chillies, right?
I never ordered candles...
Are you fine you think?
It is often hard to photograph snow.
I guess it would take one complaint.
The fines on this are pretty huge.
I wonder what would happen if google just said hey, 4% extra tax to violate all these laws, sure.
But it is possible that by ignoring all the laws, they could make more money.
I had a radish.
But then I am pretty sure the EU does not want to block google from all EU citizens.
With your government issued laptop.
If you can not affect things, it should not matter who you are.
You could be scared to say anything because you could be noticed and targetted.
I get through one or two a day.
I haven't watched any films in ages.
2160p is becoming more popular on ptp.
What is your story today.
Did you leave?
What makes it busy?
I want her to be normal already.
I am listening, and home.
Are you teleporting.
They are usually bad sofas and bad beds.
I had a giant bean bag.
Tell hla to get a job.
Are you home?
The have the right to request erasure.
What if they put the rate to 12%, and google refused.
Or, anyone gets paid, based on total hours watched, by real accounts.
Linked to your passport.
I really want mega noodles.
Tell me when to boil.
Hiss.
I have my box to eat.
I only got pocket money when I was a child.
A sofabed.
And you have a google account.
The thing on the left is the trousers?
And what is the current company offer?
Are you closing your eyes.
And then in any class, `@Inject lateinit var account: Account` with the other dagger stuff.
Which opens an alertdialog and verifies before setting.
Or maybe I am neglecting retrofit too much here :D
I went out to do a class with custom setters and getters that used shared preferences as the backend of the properties.
Are you fine?
:(
Yeah I told work today.
That is good.
Also, I worked as a paper boy at 13 or something.
I had the box of nuts and things.
Oh why am I so negative.
I am sorry.
2fancy4me
When are you home.
And then travel time.
Soha is also asking for advice with her employment.
When will you go out?
Did you listen to my last message?
What kind of new things?
Wow parents actually rented out their children in England.
And now I am a kid.
No, a library.
What will you get?
TO TEST?
You are not a horrible friend.
I see too many people who collect people to use them.
They should be asking you, you had a procedure.
We used your phone number on my form.
I will need to eat then.
I very much doubt it.
:/
Inside ikea?
I have been to a nice beach in Turkey I think.
What do we talk about?
There is nothing but sprawl here.
It is terrible we are trapped so often in here.
It is not like a contract with an appartment, you can leave usually within a week.
I just had fateer.
Nono, they are not in the Favorites section.
And Mariam, Ben, Toka, my mum, and Lisa in the favorites.
Things I would rather stay away from :D
There is just me, kareem, baroody and wahab for minya now.
It sounds like you are in wind.
I am happy you are my friend, but I will not feel like I should owe thanks to anyone for it.
Yeah I did not want to get it out.
When are you home?
My stomach has been crazy since I came home.
I came to turn the noises off.
The font.
I am fine I think.
I understood.
Rapidly trying to finish to go home.
Kareem started at Magdsoft a month after me.
The code for the applications we make now is down to me. So we use whatever libraries we want, and I mostly use kotlin.
So we use new libraries all the time.
So the team is small and nice.
The kotlin @Parcelize annotation is also magical.
And the cargo socket was unfixable, and in java because he did not want to risk it.
Was it a risk when iOS moved to swift at magdsoft?
Before I left Scotland.
The colors are fine I tihnk.
Did anyone manage to get tweezer man tweezers?
Is it as good as my mini pack lunch though.
Where might you go?
It is home time.
What will you get there?
there was no one, and it was in a cove.
I think if you are not comfortable with something, you should just keep gambling and moving on until you find something.
Where is your face.
I think with all the server stuff I do, I am quite happy with the amount of stuff I get to do.
"In England women are still occasionally used instead of horses for hauling barges, because the labour required to produce horses and machines is an accurately known quantity, while that required to maintain the women of the surplus population is beneath all calculation. Hence we nowhere find a more shameless squandering of human labour-power for despicable purposes than in England, the land of machinery."
Just clicked on kindle for kids, and it has achievements, and daily time goals.
No one has any say over how or what we code, as long as it looks good.
Dagger2 is my current favourite :D
So I started making a delegate class for sharedpreferences.
Then I realized I was being stupid and there would already be a library for this.
the `by` syntax is for delegate properties, and the stringPreference takes care of the set(v) and get() methods for that property.
Something like that.
But it was broken beyond belief.
Crazy has been in the cat carrier the whole time.
I am here ish.
I was going to sleep but heard the noises.
Good night Mariak <3
I think lisa did go visit.
Strawberries must have seeds on the outside.
I am home.
Will you go by yourself?
The beaches in scotland are quiet, but they never felt remote or wonderful. I was too used to them.
But you can never know that second one until you have worked there.
I am talking to you, and inbetween that watching a speedrun of Jak and Daxter.
And I am thinking about what to eat next.
People have to stay in jobs they do not like for a long time.
I have Gary, Nada, and my Dad there too.
I found the "kid" mode on my kindle.
KoreferenceModel must be my second favourite after dagger.
Are you a kotlin expert yet?
Doing it in java is just awful.
Who had to work on the server java code with spring framework when they decided to ditch that?
I have to fix php problems way too often. And php is something I have never studied.
Be fine.
Where are the 10000000 messages.
Tired.
Are you fine?
Pick me up on Friday.
My hands are being cold.
I think in Cairo there are so many jobs and small companies.
And I would encourage anyone to say fuck you to a company they do not like, because they should support a better one.
I have Soha and Kareem in riot too.
And I barely ever speak to them.
It is very wonderful.
It is annoying when the same type of applications come in.
Where did you go.
And 25% of children never made it past 1 year old.
Open open.
And it has reading goals, badges and achievements.
I have a custom setter for the phoneNumber preference in big book.
Kotlin, swift, and go are all very similar syntax.
I think kareem just learnt by editing my code :D
And all the model classes are Data classes because it is about 5 times faster to write.
I probably should also just call the primary constructor with default values.
I think the opposite, too big of a company and any changes are hard.
Readability and simplicity are important.
I think it looks too much like a cartoon show title.
Aparrently.
Oh yeah.
I am pretty happy with step mania these days.
Good morning.
Jesus.
But I am just home.
I mean for me, I think the most important thing is getting the number of work hours down.
So it is a gamble that is scary.
In Scotland not enough jobs is a problem for people.
Everyone would have to be retrained.
And it does not matter what language it is then.
I remember my interview at magdsoft.
Did you not think I was Russian at first?
I am super super hungry.
*Where are you*
*Will you come home and feed my mouth tonight?*
I miss being able to do this in Scotland.
But at the same importanceish, is having a comfortable work environment with nobody you hate.
Ginger is sleeping on me.
I am pulling out my face hairs, as usual.
Soha at the same time, but left 4-5 months ago.
And I do not like things communicating across the internet without me knowing.
But the IOT is just tiny computers with apis communicating the state of real things.
What will I eat?
How we make the applications is down to us.
Dagger2 to inject a Koreference class is my favourite combination yet.
What matters is good code.
How often can you have ma7shy?
I have only ever been between 58 and 64 kg.
Oh wow.
That seems like the other stuff weights not enough.
And then comes wage.
Anthing involving graphics programming I despise. It is too messy.
And I would rather my oven not be connected to my computer.
"In some branches of the wool industry in England the employment of children has been considerably lessened during recent years, and in some cases entirely abolished. Why? Because the Factory Acts made two sets of children necessary, one set working six hours, the other four, or both sets working five hours. But the parents refused to sell the 'half-timers' cheaper than the 'full-timers'. Hence the substitution of machinery for the 'half'timers'."
Why does the normal mode not have that?
But there is a lot of work for just us.
Kotlin was the best thing to happen to android in the existence of android.
But some logic I just could not be assed writing in java.
Yeah I wasted my time.
But it was java.
I could not read it because it was written so long ago :D
You know how long that is in java, right?
It was me, and I hated it.
Hahahaha.
Breakfast in the morning is the best meal of the day for me.
*I can not sleep, I can not poop tonight*
No that was just a joke.
You were waaay thinner when I knew you
I just arrived at work.
This is so 12 yo edgy.
Toka is at work so she asked nada to take me to the airport.
Or an emergency dinner would happen.
For what?
Worth it though.
But here I just have to convince the majority, which is one person.
If it was good java, fine.
I wrote big book about 85% java for baroody.
But it turns out to be 10 times faster after all.
I think java has similar functions in java 9 though.
Because most languages are roughtly the same.
He risked using nodejs for some socket stuff and the code was disasterous.
My tweezers are destroyed so they are pretty important.
Honestly at that point, I had not programmed on Android for over two years.
Eww life before constraints.
Life after the databinding library and xml :D
Oh mum mother is visiting this saturday.
It is nothing to the sunflower oil I drink before bed.
Other than fool, fateer, tameya, and everything else egyptian, my diet is otherwise healthy.
I only have fateer once or twice a month.
But shhhh.
Oh 63-70kg.
I know that mosque :D
So I dug up two or three old projects.
I wish I had some raw cocoa beans.
Oh wow.
Toka is home.
Do you want to be in the team?
It would have to be 100% reliable.
Actually, I can do it.
Just the last things.
Oh okay.
*on linux
Games can use the gpu.
*I need somebody and always*
**HELLO THERE**
Sweetal?
Actually, I only know the values in stone :D
We are not over the limit.
I do not think my computer is doing anything, but just press the off button in case.
You can just open the songs in mpv.
Wait I can connect to your computer.
I use tweezers for hours every single day.
They asked to see some code of mine.
I think that is where I got my last two pairs.
My mum mother.
*To sing the song of hunger*
And I have not added sugar to anything since.
I only have it in hot chocolate and porridge. I do not use sugar for anything else.
Good morning.
greek
show me the output of `installed`
rhythmbox is not there?
Oh, yeah.
Yes, but having dinner, why?
Why not?
I am uploading the sentences now.
And one of them was in kotlin.
Boots?
Actually, I started really really liking chillies.
I just crave chillies these days.
*And I'm so hungry*
*Feed my mouth tonight*
**THE ANGEL FROM MY COOK SHOW**
I also got a huge tub of sweetal months ago.
I would ask you to take me but your car would break or something.
No, you.
just use the ffmpeg library.
I have not tried any video editing for about 10 years.
Just wine vegas.
I heard there is a vulkan implementation of direct3d11
And a constraint layout for good measure.
They have a few of each: cashew, almond, hazelnut, raison, roasted corn, cinnamon, doum, peanut, date, date roll, walnut.
Oh and carab.
Or macedamia nuts.
Well, I did add to the apple crumble.
Probably all the deserts.
I do not eat much, the breakfast at magdsoft, the little lunch box, and something else later, but smaller than breakfast.
I think all your muscles, bones, and organs would weight more than 49kg.
My mum is here on Saturday.
Hold on, you are going to love this message.
I started making little lunch boxes.
I am still eating super fool in the morning.
Satisfaction wise.
Are yo done.
This is a huge difference.
65kg with 10% would seem normal.
But I would rather not voice it.
Is it any better?
Did you do a search for best video editor in r/linux ?
I have done about 25.
Actually, I made apple crumble last week.
I got some oats and started having porridge recently. I really missed it.
It is way too much effort to make.
I have no idea how much I weight. Probably around 62kg.
I will be back in a bit.
Are you happy with your weight now?
What is the target?
Okay no just drive better.
My dream was bad.
The best time of the day.
Maybe.
Me too.
Just a guess.
No, get back to work.
Maybe a 9.5
Working on a work of art, hold on.
Google's is not released, not sure about apple's.
bee
Maybe the power of openshot comes with plugins.
I have no idea.
I am home.
I had misasasa3a and am super tired.
No idea.
9
Does it not feel bad?
By who?
I would go out at nights wandering the beaches and the coast to be away from them.
**BERRIES**
Bananasaurus.
I may be back in a bit from the phone.
If you think you will be here.
You already did not miss the final exam.
Okay breakfast time.
This is a joke.
Coming home.
But for one voice.
You could but your microphone struggles.
Do you want to play with my voice?
Okay.
Are you sure everything is not a berry?
You can only close your eyes and walk tagamo3a375ama.
I did 30, but aparrently it gets better with more.
Well, medium.
They will delete all data upon request though.
Google and apple both have pretty perfect synthesis now.
There is a site I just uploaded lots of sentences of me speaking.
And now it can generate me speaking anything.
I recorded 100 sentences so far.
Do you have any nice fruits?
I cry currently maybe once every three months.
I think once a week would not be that uncommon.
Berranan.
Good morning Mariam.
And potato scones.
Give me a sentence and I will send you the generated audio.
Yeah, I read the terms and privacy before.
It processes quickly though.
Also, better than google translates voice.
You need a quiet room with a good microphone.
I wish I had your voice.
Do you just drink too much water.
Well, yeah, family are why your life is worse.
Also, I am guessing you are 21.
Maybe sunflower spread.
And unlocked phone?
What about when we first met.
The jar.
Emm no stope
Where are you.
Okay, 100, time to proccess.
Doritos are a berry.
Remember, I ran away from my family.
** BERRIES **
What?
Different things than last time.
The internet connection is horrible.
I think there is no rules.
When are you going to that place?
You should get up, shower, get dressed, have breakfast.
Which type?
They only do 2 litres I think.
Standard strength, but it ran out so quickly.
Do you want to write a sentence to hear it?
I am not sure if I am 25 or 26.
Be here in the morning.
Is it updating?
It shows up though?
What?
Maybe.
Pass by where?
Where did you go.
A kilo is 16 pounds here.
I doubt it, you could put it in a bag.
Is the journey long?
Yeah.
21 years is too long to live with people.
I think 26. I always blamed things on being 25.
Or forget the potato scones.
I hope you did not fall asleep again.
I will have porridge, but in a bit.
Up to 75 recordings now.
It is bedtime.
I am not too sleepy.
No, that is a citrus, not a berry.
Okay toka wants to sleep.
And a loaf of warburtons seeded.
Holland and barret usually have deals.
I imagine the good ones cost a lot more though.
No way, the juice is the most important.
Will you send you.
Do you have kiwi?
Oh no not crisps.
But you are still with your parents and this time of life is just worse.
Do you have a dodgy extension?
I can fix that, but after breakfast.
The purple one.
Only if you have spare room.
I am.
Well, it is easy to manufacture.
I am home now.
I am home.
They are berry unhealthy.
You can see the internet speed in the top bar, right?
I think so.
<3
How many aniversarries do we have.
Close the tab and open in another tab.
Wake up.
Then you will feel more alive.
How much were the cashews?
There are no restrictions on either end.
You paid about twice as much as the value of cashews.
Will you be here in the mansoura?
I have knocked on their door before at 1-2am and told them to shut up.
Kids smashing glasses.
Yeah.
Yeah, I will get you Nada's.
Or when you get out of the airport.
We may just see you, but if we do not see you, we know you are outside, so we could look around instead of just waiting for the plane to land and for you to get out.
Okay, **BRB**
Bring Real Bananas.
Connected to the computer directly?
Tesco brand :O
The Egyptian Ministry of Health prohibits the importation of natural products, vitamins and food supplements in their finished form.
Okay, it is your mission.
Toka will be at work.
You could put your phone on no background data mode.
These were my parents' favourite car games.
I only wore one twice.
My dad gave me a load of photos when my mum came here last.
And this is what I look like 50% of the time.
But Friday you will pick me up.
Goodnight Mariak.
There is no limits.
I will have to check again.
Sure.
So I will be going with Nada I think.
Does Hla play games in the car?
Kilt.
Weddings I think. I was young.
Hahahahah did you ever see this?
I found the kilt photo.
No.
This is when I arrived on earth.
Wait I was away.
500? I have no idea.
What are you thinking?
Jesus.
Just when the plane lands.
It was.
It was something I did on twitter then everyone did it too.
Is my mission complete?
Falling asleep.
I will go down now?
Since I arrived.
You can come with esra if you want.
Stay awake.
Wow that is expensive.
Just meat.
You did manage to smuggle in all those b12 pills though.
Hmm, will you be here in the car?
Is it the aunt that saw me?
There is a family who come and live in the flat next to us every few days some times.
Right, I have to make porridge.
Did you cry today yet?
I have not looked at them much I think.
Yeah, it is fine.
That is the quadruple strength, right?
Yeah.
It is a bit dodgy that they only allow supplements made in egypt to be in egypt.
Z mum.
After 10, and I shout at them to stop.
When you get outside, you could ring Nada, and nada would get a missed call.
Does she play the statue game?
Oh they are mostly newer ones.
The first time I wore a suit.
When I scanned my face.
I am not trying to fall asleep, but I am very sleepy.
For less than 350?
Goodnight Mariak.
I want this project to finish.
hahahaha
Okay well, you can go then.
I am cold, and hungry.
And they just scream, cry, and shout.
And cause a mess with rubbish.
They try to shut up.
Then we know we can find you.
My grandmother would play the B&P game with me.
Her name was Brenda, and she got a point every time she saw a B&B (bed and breakfast) sign.
I had a hard drive break when I was 18, and I lost all photos from before that that I took.
No you look old.
Come back.
lyrebird.ai
I think I will heat up misa3a from last night.
No no no.
You should practice on it.
It sells for 640egp in egypt online.
Yeah no, it is 640 because we could just buy it online.
Oh yeah.
I hope there is no one to shout at when we move flat.
Well, I will have no money either after dealing with the taxi person.
So we know if something is wrong and can go look around.
Oh yeah, a careem would work.
But if we know where you are to order the taxi to, we could just be there.
It is porridge time.
Yes.
What did you have?
9:45.
:(
I will have misa3a3a75.
No.
680 on souq.
Are you interested in anything anyone is saying?
<3
People who leave dogs trapped and barking too.
But I also need to talk to Nada.
Then open riot, and send a message to nada, then turn data back off.
Or the silent game?
I can not believe we actually played the silent game.
And I got a point every time I saw a parking sign.
Ben is the top left of that photo, and kirsty with him.
Here is my most cups in one hand record.
I am finally making the porridge.
Okay.
Have some fruit.
What happens at your aunt's?
If you can carry it.
About to go downstairs to help toka carry up the cat food.
I should meet you down there to carry it?
I have knocked on many doors telling people to shut up.
When I get to the stage of knocking on a door, the language is not as important as how angry I look.
I often have to shout at people doing building work too late at night.
Everyone gets shouted at.
Or maybe better, just ring nada, and nada will not answer.
Does that cost money?
Your phone will work.
Shall I send some?
I am getting sleepy.
But I am kind of way too sleep and lazy to get it.
To make.
I had the misasa3.
Did the fizzy juice make you explode?
Okay that is done.
What are they talking about?
I am close.
Fiiiine you would rather spend the time with the Z brigade.
Oh it is not a problem.
I had porridge.
Getting better I think.
Phew.
Kilts are just standard scottish formal wear.
I was very drunk.
Kayleigh
Here was the day we slept over in the girls flat.
Did you see how ginger my beard hair is?
I can name all those people.
Have some water.
That is the most blurry photo ever taken.
Yeah.
I walked out the room and got some coffee.
Today is too noisy.
We have no noodles.
10kg would be 370egp from souq.
Or just buy the big bag next time.
Cats are never lost.
Because no one could work.
Nothing.
Jesus.
There are here.
You have to upset someone now.
Nooodles.
Does your aunt know I live here now?
Some people throw out cats.
Wake up.
It was in Arabic, and not important.
We will do a video call to make sure everything is packed and ready tomorrow.
I am rushing to finish work.
It is my weekend.
Were is that face you promised.
I am out of oats now.
Come in.
Pesto, jeez.
Eww.
Did you notice the recordings?
It got into space without staging.
Are you distracted.
What the fuck.
Hi.
I will try to dream.
Josicat 18kg
Where are you?
I wish I had more hours to sleep.
There are laws on which ideologies are allowed to run in parliment.
How are you?
Oh you came in and then did not.
You are staying in our flat.
Linda is basically a stranger to me.
And you have data in Europe now.
Hmmmmmmm.
The internet is so bad.
The HR was expressing to everyone why the earth is flat and I lost it and shouted at him for being stupid.
I have no idea how it got to that.
Oh power just came on.
I want my weekend.
I might be late late tonight.
I met the deadline.
Something about glasses.
When will you come back.
Does lisa know about this?
It is probably stray and wants food.
Everyone was just talking.
I am so hungry I will implode.
It really hurts.
Fateer is my option but ugh.
Not yet.
I wonder if it plays on my new computer.
Did you check the prices?
My expectations grew to an entire ring.
As always.
It is not tomorrow.
You already spoke to her before us?
I am not okay with this.
I am pretty sure it is not just me here.
Can you not sleep yet?
There is nothing to just snack on
Are you on the way home.
This is not the usa.
These are the glasses I heard about.
Goodnight Mariak.
Well, two.
I want my mum visiting.
She already booked?
Toka will be working.
There will not be going out every day.
Less upset than me.
lyrebird.ai
The power just came on.
Yeah, the whole morning.
I am home.
Yesterday yeah.
I am so sleepy.
I am too lazy.
I am still here.
I am awake.
There is a huge difference between a mum visit, and a mum and her friend visit.
Okay.
I am home.
And super hungry.
I am starving right now.
I do not know, but I am not sure it is a good impression to make.
Can you not find a menu?
I will fall.
Four people in this flat is a crowd.
There is no bed for her.
And it is time sensitive.
**IT IS WED NES DAY MY DUDES**
I am falling.
Are you about to punch yourself?
It is pretty easy.
Only one sofa is long enough to sleep on.
Has she booked and payed for a flight?
And we have plenty of towels.
Jesus.
You said 6 minutes ago she was looking at booking.
You can not invite people to stay at someone's house without being granted invite permissions.
You are 40 odd, you should have already known to ask first.
Did he have a nickname?
Well, after last time, we tripled our towel collection.
Now it is mega coffee time.
You are home now.
Why?
Have you asked Linda yet?
You will not need many clothes, we have a washing machine.
Mummy is going to think I am mad if I am not replying.
We went to get breakfast.
I got ksp, and it seems to run fine.
It is the 5th most trending project on github so I guess it is new.
In the feature list they have youtube import listed unchecked.
The videos start instantly on the demo servers.
Or is it a **VIRUS**.
Saturday 6:40pm I think.
Yeah I have the email.
You should phone to make sure the times are still the same.
Or check the website.
What.
Lisa, any ideas?
Actually, yeah, if you have the spread, crumpets.
I just make my own.
The round warbutons potato scones?
Good old lenin.
Not yet.
Will you be awake all night?
Messaging you and nothing.
I will get into bed and maybe be here in a bit.
It is talking about fixing your sleep schedule.
It has been a long time.
Did you have rain today?
What are you doing tomorrow?
That is your next TEDx talk.
I have a great day streak on Duolingo in this email and delete all copies from your system immediately.
I know.
But if you were, you have come to the right place.
Did he have children?
It rained heavy today.
I am heating up some fateer.
I have a 46 day streak on duolingo now.
You start with autopredict and you keep picking one of the three words until the sentence is done.
The cats are never too busy to be useful for a long time.
But do not put incence sticks in my birthday cake.
Do you hug often?
Before I was married I almost never hugged or even touched anyone.
Safe or stable?
Me too but I have a feeling inside.
Do you ever cry from anything I say?
I do not really know how to address Hazem. I just leave it up to you.
Uh oh come back.
In a way.
You only bought one?
I think not then.
Oh god.
Or those sandwhich breads I had fake ham with.
Oh wow they changed their design
Then yes.
But, is it multiplayer.
Any updates to streets of rogue?
It is okay for me.
Lenin was a bank robber.
Yes, I am.
I am here.
What why.
Why do you need a hug.
Where did that come from?
Hmmmm.
Soya pure and the other sunflower brand?
That was delicious.
I think she will be fine, she is nervous though.
Something like a 4 hour transfer time in germany.
What is your phone number, for my mum.
They should, but worth checking.
Yeah, with preference fragments.
I will fall into the API for a while and then the vet.
I will go to work that day and leave early.
Did you fall.
Do you mean one for yourself?
Yeah that all looks delicious.
I watched quite a lot of it.
Google drive unlimited is unlimited too.
Well send a photo of anything so the chat clears.
Are you awake.
Here is a game.
Me too.
Insense and lamps will do me.
Was it the candle smoke.
Okay but with little intermission.
Nono reread.
Do you really feel lost?
But things happen and you find something.
Jesus that looks sketchy.
With some of the fake ham.
Okay.
Some guy was storing all of soundcloud on it.
Are you conducting some type of explosive stomach theory?
How is a sugar drink healthier than a coffee?
Are you fine?
Why is she awake so late.
You will come pick me up tomorrow.
Hmm, it has nothing do with animals.
Yeah.
I am making dinner.
Are they a suprise?
Or two.
What are you heating up?
I have the fateer.
Did you fall.
No no crying.
No.
A little like adrenaline.
Some ice cream.
The mother can look after them alone?
It was humungous.
Yeah I have loads of 3 pins.
In the oven?
You three, oh galore.
What a time to be alive.
Why do you need a hug?
Oh I love you Mariam.
When will your avatar be a bigger face?
I still have tonnes of wii u games to pirate first.
Oh yeah, the easiest question of all.
I ain't playing tricks.
No, I am off.
hi
I will only get it if I can hack it and pirate.
Oh that is fine then.
I will get toka to send that in arabic.
No no you must be able to pack it into the small one.
I doubt it.
Actually, no that can be another time.
Where are you today.
Want to try kerbal?
I just hate candles for being fire indoors.
I think everyone is after school.
I was occupied with computers and boredom while I glided through.
Now I am wondering if I have seen you in the old glasses.
What you need is painty ones.
Fiiiine.
Probably.
Not going to bother then. The graphics look too good as it is.
I will say more details later today.
The guy who does WTF is.
Why why?
I think boredom played a massive role in choices and things I did.
I do not know the word for it.
Was it new glasses or just a frame?
Did you check the weight?
Good morning.
It is on linux, right?
Are we thinking of the same person?
Are you free to call?
When are you setting off?
Do not trust or talk to anyone you do not have to.
You better not sleep through.
And I have had too many chillies.
I always have chillies.
Lost.host.
What does this mean?
<3
Free is free.
How about a multiplayer game today?
I can list them and you can flag if they are good and multiplayer.
+201090026755
I will return home from work, you will meet me here, then we drive to the airport?
I think tooth and tail may be the only other multiplayer.
What did you take out?
Wake up.
Could you write our address in english and arabic and photo it for my mum.
Yes.
When are you back.
But maybe builders and cats.
She leaves early Saturday.
Hey.
Were are the million photos for the mission.
Have a brought you down?
Do you like your new frames?
I really want to compare them to the old ones.
I think I will get a switch next year.
I wonder if golf with friends was updated.
Monaco for Linux - Version 1.0-----------------Monaco is a 32bit only game and requires 32bit libraries be installed.* Updated 2013-10-29 *Fixes mouse buttons to correctly work in-game.
The new terminal, probably.
I am 1000000000% hungry.
But just tomorrow.
Do you still feel high?
I always feel like I have this affect.
The new ones make you look more authory.
Hello
Did you check the limit?
beat cop, monaco, pixeljunkshooter, agatha knife, teh curious expedition, serial cleaner, the first tree, tooth and tail.
Okay, now what is wrong with the Irish reviewer?
They just xray them.
So we should be there at 6pm.
I have no idea.
But it makes you cry.
Mariam Mariam Mariam.
One is probably fine.
Is 20kg not the limit?
Yeah.
What else did you watch?
Mathew matosis.
when?
Boyfriend.............
I am not sure he will if I am off all week too.
Mariam.
I only get 220 a month.
I actually need a game to play today.
Like cubeworld.
Yeah. But is it online.
It was on the british critics top 10 of last year.
Cynicalbrit?
Buy no, they can not photograph me.
I am.
No I am here.
Just be very careful with data if you turn it on.
Are you making sure mummy does not sleep through?
You have indomie?
I am too poor to afford games.
Depends on the game but 30-50 is too much for my income.
No idea which version I have.
You have the new toe socks?
Could you wear extra clothes?
Oh before I forget.
You have told those words and times to esraa and she has said with confidence that those times are fine?
There is no backup plan. We need to be there when my mum arrives.
Okay.
Actually, I have loads of games downloaded I have not played.
Okay give me a few minutes.
It is on fdroid and fdroid does not accept tracking or spying.
Pretty sure you are allowed to lock them.
Well, she will not have internet.
Crepe of some sort?
I need high energy.
Are you here yet.
Yeah.
So if you arrive at our flat at 5:15.
When?
Toka is going to write it.
What do you get.
I would not thing the Mariam would have noodles.
Or they are too cheap.
I am so sleepy but I do not want to leave after so little time.
And you would say no no sleep is important Goodnight Pauk.
I have no good excuse.
I should.
Gate
Will my stomach last.
But that should be last last last resort.
Make sure to turn off background data.
My stomach really hurts.
What did she get?
Are you not in bed yet.
Yalla and sourir I am sleepy.
Local time.
Are you on the way?
Yeah a bit.
My mum fancies roast vegetables.
Oh yeah this is much better.
Ms Muhandis over here.
Hmmm, no I can not wait.
One was from japan.
You better hurry home.
XorFlip, just barely do it.
I waited all day.
I am joking.
I am trying.
I am leaving early.
I kept peeing and noise.
It is so noisy.
Come in.
When are you home?
You better be hungry.
Hello.
Chefat has two tiny design changes, that I might do at home if I get time.
Confirm.
I can not be bothered to work tomorrow.
I think if you saw me now you would question my conciousness.
Just finishing my coffee.
11:15 maybe.
Everything fine?
I know.
The spice shop, the baking shop, the bakery, and the fruit and vegtable guy.
I am stuck in the bathroom.
The chillies just make it spicy.
We will be at that terminal at 6 hopefully.
Okay but how are you.
My mum will be leaving in two hours.
I am addicted.
The light is still on.
I will see if I can bring something to eat and drink.
Okay.
You are going to need earplugs.
I will leave work in 2:45 hours.
Airport times are always local time.
I have been super hungry all day.
Berries always berries.
You on have goumet meals.
Will you send you.
Okay. I am at work now.
Good morning.
You
You locked ginger in your cupboard again.
I keep forgetting it is X, but then maybe just call it ZorFlip.
Where are you.
And I think the font should be  less roundy.
I only had the usual.
What did you want?
But you should never want me to sleep and go away.
Egypt noise.
Goodnight Mariak.
Coffee done.
My logo is perfect.
Oh wow.
Probably.
And I will shower.
Or five. And I keep them forever with me.
Come in.
I really screwed my wrist yesterday.
My mum says to pick up coca cola. "A big bottle, I will drink it all".
I just had chillies and dates and a crepe with vegetables.
Think.
Because price is a non issue.
Would you meet her?
You are you. Do you.
It is fine. I just only slept four hours last night.
I can now.
Hmm never came online in Germany.
That must have been boring.
Dress and teeth and cycle.
My mum is just getting on the germany to egypt plane.
I have two more hours.
Yalla what?
Okay.
She is in our flat now.
When are you home?
My mum is here.
It is tiny and it feels like air when it is on.
That is good.
I kind of got hooked on this one too.
Where's my bits at, blip bloop.
I feel like you would say something if I had noodles.
No wonder you are not sleepy.
Are you waiting for you hate number now?
Okay so 4ish hours to your next flight?
I am just going to go to work.
Airport food is expensive.
Okay.
So 5.25 german time.
Okay.
I have all the new stuff.
But with an X maybe.
Good morning.
I have so many new ones expect a new playlist soon.
From 5-20 pages.
We flip your bits, yo.
Are you home.
Or just "bleep bloop".
Okay.
They have free water fountains.
You will get dinner on the flight though.
British airways gave me packs of nuts and biscuits.
We are home.
Me and my mum just went to get food.
I miss you.
I actually have three letters from people.
But full of good food.
The usual.
Hedeya is just checking what a response code is and means.
Why do we need more carpets?
Everything is on time still?
Everything is still fine?
Could you pick up a dish washing sponge?
That is three often.
I am here.
But secretly we know we talk everyday.
They are long though.
Mummy cleaned the fridge.
What are you doing?
Lentil carrot and onion.
Did you use a font or just draw it?
4
Where are you.
My backpack is the best.
I learnt it two years ago in a book.
Mariam, are you going to send me an email tonight?
So we will see tomorrow.
Yeah, plenty of those too.
On my desk.
Inverting the play store icon.
What is the eta.
She said we can wait.
Too much time on chat.magdsoft though.
She is fine.
Nah you never told me.
I think she is a little awkward meeting.
To anyone.
My mum is cleaning the fridge.
My mum will watch a movie here.
As if we only keep in contact a few times a year.
And one from canada.
What no, the two peices of paper on my desk.
Cleaning and cooking everything.
Or google, professional software company fonts.
I did remember something like that.
She seems to act really nice and into it.
Do you need a megamocha?
Get out. She likes thrillers.
Like a fake letter.
I wrote them down on my paper.
Fine.
You need a new font.
The ones that scream efficiency and productivity :D
Maybe.
I got 2kg of oats for 50egp.
I guess the internet is bad.
Well, I went to the same breakfast place.
And one other thing I forgot.
Pretty good.
Hmmmmm.
Not really.
I have 100 of them.
I am setting up my tiny tiny computer.
Are you home yet?
Alpacas seem like the coolest looking animals.
Because you seem to just serve it up on a platter to them.
Have a read of this.
Yeah, but they are quite clear on the non-lined paper.
She is.
Below and to the left of the innovuae tasks that I crossed out at the top.
Minimal. Viable. Product.
She can wait until tomorrow.
Ginger is lying on me on the hot water bottle.
I forgot what country it was though.
Are you alive?
Jeez, my mum has never seen it.
Are they paying for your soul?
You have not had a day off since you started.
No, six days is taking too much.
She always sides with the employer.
I do not give a shit.
Did you write the letter.
But not really.
We went to panda today and got some more food.
My mum thinks you are absolutely crazy.
Wake up, press send.
I think you just have to try loads and pick the good ones.
What thing?
Where is that?
Fayoum is next wednesday I think.
See if you can switch days.
You want to go to work more than you want to go to fayoum with me?
Lisa.
Because my work were planning it.
Waiting for toka to be home so we can have lentil soup.
There are too many fonts and I do not know too much about them.
Nah, they need me.
Not tomorrow.
They can not keep taking so much from you without giving.
Are you married to your job?
It is not your responsibility to provide teachers to the students.
And toka will not take a day off to go with me.
You should try loads.
It is cut so I thought it was an edit of the original.
A bee.
You forgot dandy lions existed?
I played with them too much as I child.
You forgot to give mummy your 3ds.
Do you need some of my earplugs?
Oh I missed this message.
Fucking plants learning how to exploit human children.
Holiday days are not for emergencies.
She believes she has no choice and she can not take a holiday.
Why on earth is she prioritising going to work over the break and visit to fayoum she want to go to.
Did you eat fool at work.
The reviews are terrible.
Is it old?
What the hell are substitute teachers for?
As if her work owns her life.
But if it were me, I would ask, and then if they say no, I would take it anyway.
Spending the money opening a new branch instead of finishing the first.
Toka has wanted to go to a little holiday to fayoum for quite a while now.
She works at a small startup teaching center that her friends started a couple of months ago.
And because she thinks these people are friends, she sides with them.
If they do not like me being happy, they can fire me.
I do not talk about people much.
My mum said you seemed quiet and gentle.
I am here.
And you have been asleep for seven hours so wake up.
I just let her out of your wardrope.
Yeah, we just had some toast.
I got new tweezers and now I am pulling everything out of my face and destroying it.
Yes.
You want to go to fayoum.
Take a bloody holiday day.
Your work should always come second.
It is next wednesday.
And yes.
Take all the medicine.
My mum wants a rice pudding too.
Mabye a banana instead.
The koshary is here.
She said it sounds like mine but I think not.
...
No.
Did you get food poisoning?
Need the boil water signal.
Should I start cooking?
I suppose you mean remove your overies so you do not get a menstrual cycle.
My  mum has been napping for 2-3 hours.
El tahrir.
We are making bread.
Get my mum something mushroomy and cheesy.
I am falling but I wanted to say hi.
Because she is completely submissive to her employer and has no confidence.
But one of them is the employer and made her work 6 day weeks for over a month.
She will not even ask for the holiday.
The order is a mess.
What about hangouts.
DId you see the playlist.
Wow.
Maybe it is Koshaday.
To give me in person?
Because your hormone levels will completely shift.
I will shower and try to fix my face a little.
I need to ban myself from the tweezers.
IT IS HERE
It smelt like chocolate mint but only taste a little like chocolate.
If we could call you could talk to her.
It will be fine. I will call in three minutes.
Wake up.
My sister got me chocolate mint coffee.
And I just made it now.
It is the only day we see her for a while.
Okay now it is 10 hours.
Where are you.
Not yet.
Is it time to order now.
Do you feel better.
What will you have?
I am playing a game about managing a software company.
Normal bread.
The bread failed.
Hi.
Toka's parents.
We are delaying it to thursday.
My mum is napping.
Throw everything out, fill up with water and medicine, write the letter, be better, yalla to cairo, trade letter for ear plugs.
I guess it will change you as a person too much.
Then maybe have some toast.
We are just ordering koshary.
It is the last chance.
No, you never said so.
I have to build the office and decorate it with everything then employ people and everything.
At an opticians?
Okay.
Then you sent one.
Are you home.
Awwww.
Already boiled.
You locked ginger in the wardrope again.
I mean cairo cairo.
What are you doing.
Phew.
Hi.
Yes.
Not mushrooms and cheese together.
That will be fine.
Or two.
What is happening to you?
My mum just found out who you are.
Come back.
|ro
I had the chocolate mint coffee this morning.
I need to pee.
Koshary is koshary.
If you can, it would prevent that.
Come in.
Write the letter.
And if they have those bread things.
Hmm
Will you risk eating?
Cheesy vegetables maybe.
I will sleep.
Leave me a thousand messages.
Wake up.
It was a much broader scope than just that.
I am in.
Okay.
Okay we will leave at 3pm.
Also, how we will get there.
Is this all menstrual pain?
Will the new playlist help your pain?
My face is a mess.
Yeah.
Will you be fine by friday.
You could maybe just come visit the flat on friday.
A loaf.
Only a little.
I forgot to listen to the voice message.
I do not know. My mum mixed the ingredients.
<3
They could have worms/fleas.
They could fight.
My mum is wondering when we are leaving tonight.
I am awake.
Goodnight Mariak.
Good morning.
I should wake my mum up and shower.
Will we meet at the usual spot?
We are home.
What will you do now?
Yes.
Yeah.
Love you.
Did you not make an appointment?
My mum want ketchup.
Meet Friday.
Ish.
Two cats are enough hassle.
Should I take anything?
I think I got that part.
How are you feeling now?
My mum wants something not spicy.
I though about how I had not sent them in a while.
I am here.
Oh I still have the voice note.
Wake wake wake up.
It is up to you.
And I gain nothing.
I have a huge spot on my face, wow.
Hi.
Jeez.
But it is a bit weird wearing it now.
<3
Where are you.
Mummy can fill you in.
When.
Is it even Lina's cat?
It cost 16 but he accepted 15.
I am very sleepy.
Should we start cooking them in a bit before you arrive?
Wake up.
Oh that is good then.
Anything?
I can be a doctor.
Wake up.
You will have internet?
Landed 21m ago.
Yeah.
Did you like the picture on it?
I am so sleepy.
How did you make that connection so quickly?
You can probably ask mummy when she gets home.
Any new information?
I need hot juice.
Love you.
I will check the flight status.
I am feeling fine and I am doing quite alright.
**It is not a stroke**
Super hungry.
But there are crumpets.
Hmmm.
Well, everything got discussed.
It is freezing.
Okay.
Oh good.
When are you home.
The fool was nothing like the same when at the roundabout.
It felt less bumpy.
Where is the room.
I am going to fall.
I know that photo in the frame at the bottom right.
But toka is home now.
It will take us about 25 minutes to walk there, maybe 30 if she is slow.
It is fine.
No no walking is healthy.
Or is it a stranger who is looking for free cat care?
Are you finished.
One taxi and two busses.
My mum wants to make chips.
Do you want some cut but not cooked?
Are you not driving?
I havnae had it in years.
How is it going?
Oh god what.
Would it be easier to kareem it.
Are you hungry?
And sorry for your anxiety.
I am back from the airport.
What is in it?
Probably her old age.
*piano music starts*
You will finish university and make a used car selling app. It will be the ebay of cars. Carbay it will be called.
I think I will have the fool.
Be online.
And earplugs.
She would have to pay the extra luggage on that bus too.
Okay maybe I accidentally hid it the whole time.
Or, you just saved a trip to the eye doctor and you are clinically blind.
Yeah.
Any problems?
She actually said nothing.
ALMOST COMING HOME
It feels odd.
I am home.
I wore the cycling trousers today.
I am sorry for my face.
I have hot orange juice and it is the best.
Oh that was ages.
Okay will you have time for chips?
Where are you.
Are you going to be blocking everything out?
For three months?
I think probably.
Is that free?
How are you doing today?
I will make an eye chart.
No no no no.
Body is too hot.
But I am paranoid about them going down.
When do you expect to be home?
The bum was super comfy on the bike.
Lisa has picked up my mum now.
How is the weather?
I do not have the headphones with me though.
A stroke is an artery problem.
Shoes feel very soft and comfy on my bike.
Good morning.
Will you be here in 30 minutes?
Are you happy you met my mum?
Is mummy there now?
Her fleece.
You are awake.
What are you doing today?
Why is your room a mess?
I am almost finished work.
Will we call today?
Bum is very soft.
Too many clothes.
But not the painting on the wall.
That was tiny for so long.
Whitey gray.
I still still have the message to listen to.
Yes, she is very easy to live with.
Where is your face.
I am listening.
Did you listen to the playlist.
I think you are on the forth week.
That should be fun.
The air in the tubes.
Nope-.
I just had juice and now I am begging for the heat wave.
So get your popcorn.
Darctery Meredith.
Backback is magical.
What do you want to occupy your mind with all the time.
But bays are for boats.
<3
But it was nowhere near as good.
Very comfy.
Are you home.
What do you want to eat.
I just made a message 65 minutes long.
I will stop talking to upload the clip.
I just had some of the fool we took home.
What is in the drawers?
Nope.
Are you listening.
You might find it very funny.
I have no idea why that is funny.
It is 100x better.
Wake up.
It got cancled at work.
Mmm.
It is boiling.
Do you feel how hot today is.
Did only the mirror move?
There is a heat wave this weak.
Go look at the weather in cairo this week.
Where are you.
I am home.
I am hungry.
I am hot.
I am sweaty.
I am hohunoty.
I am just home.
What will you do tonight.
I miiiiight have the noodles.
"It is not hot yet" - noodle oil
Did you sleep.
Did you buy food?
Did Hla finish her homework.
Yes to what?
Guess how much.
33% rise to 6000.
It was the end of six months, but this time it is a year.
He owns companies that exploit convenience.
And a backwards country.
Certain capitalists already dominate in the uk.
Anything from credecard?
Can you open it?
Did you take the bones out?
Are you feeling different?
I wish I could help someone young learn.
Will you get something special.
Okay, it will not work then, never mind.
Trying to get into my paypal account.
I need my card number :/
Leaving in five minutes.
Will you get me a fresh loaf of bread?
With some carrot oil.
And egyptian sun.
Need. To. Drink. The. Juice.
I replied ish in text.
33% pay rise this year :D
What else does he have?
Oh it worked?
6000.
Making mushroom and onions now.
I was very happy.
I had coffee and feeling a bit better.
Did you meet.
Ohhh you mean your legs are really sweet now.
Do you feel normal?
Do you feel estatic?
It will cancel out my message then.
Oh wow.
Will you listen to the message.
What did you get?
<3
Because I am working class.
immoral.
It is not the same.
The uk is far into imperialism.
I think carefour had a good bakery.
I light the warm light of your room at night though.
Everything is a berry is the only lesson I have.
But you never wrote the cheque.
I want hot juice.
Will you go to gourmet Egypt?
I am in bed.
Yesterday was pretty warm.
Guess who just got a suprise pay rise.
Could you give me a code that you will get when the phone rings?
Egypt is early capitalism.
I also think he does not have that much money.
He still lives with his parents.
I did a celebration dance when he told me.
If I shave, I get that feeling for about 30 minutes then they are spikey.
Cairo does not have minigolf, at all.
Oh I do not like curtains open when it is dark.
Who does Hla think I am?
Come back.
I did.
And he just wants to start companies every second week.
Yeah.
No call?
Capitalists are battling it out in egypt.
Oh yeah.
Did I get any mail recently?
I think they may have send a new card automatically.
9286 is the code.
I got a suprise pay rise.
What about the art on the latest playlist.
I
I like it open during the day though.
And if your light is on and it is dark outside, people can easily see you.
It is too late to go now.
Wake up.
Yearly pay rise today :D
I think he is a bad person.
Hmm, phone call again.
Hmmm, we can cook when I get home?
Urgent thing.
All the eye doctors.
Much better than the canned ones.
Are the bills any more reasonable?
This person makes many very nice things.
I feel like you are mid shopping.
am not sure. I just feel safer when the curtain is shut.
Is it English homework?
I wonder if when we started talking your English was really bad.
Are you scared she can not be discrete?
It was so warm today but you slept through it.
I would never do this because I think it is imorral.
I want to do something productive, not explotive.
Are you at home?
5:30.
It is only on the card.
Nah, it is okay.
It must have scared you away.
Oh sorry.
I have never seen a stables in cairo.
Neoihece.
Where are you.
Is anyone at home?
I think he will spend all his money going to any conference.
He has no outgoings.
I will be a bit late.
<3
I am here.
I just see abuse to horses.
What are you doing?
Your parents would really really think I was a spy if Hla mentioned me helping her with homework.
He came.
Did you finish the playlist.
Oh, enter 7133
He rents out meeting spaces.
No, did the phone ring?
Or going straight to work?
Thanks.
I got in.
A 33% rise.
Did you make an appointment this time?
Okay prepare yourself.
I read it just before sleeping and forgot.
I have loads of double concentrate and it is the golden days currently.
I got a suprise pay rise today, from 4500, to 6000, for the next year.
I feel like I nag.
Did they just wake up?
Poppy looks like a hot water bottle.
Are you ready to pack 600L of Robinsons?
Are you all settled in the new house now?
Good luck.
I will be here in 20 minutes, maybe.
Both sides though.
I woke up at 6am this morning.
Will we hangout tonight?
Did you hear the message yet.
I will make crumpets.
33%, so I was very happy with that.
Here where.
Oh jeez.
Did you manage to see a doctor?
Oh wow.
I am knackered.
Our time was nice. Not busy, just relaxing. The trip had no hitches. All the right terminals.
Things are fine right now.
Wake up.
Thanks.
I accept any.
When will you be home?
I am home.
It went sign with deafness.
It went sublime with mariam.
Hurry home and stop everything.
Yes noodles.
Mega noodles.
I am scared to go to bed at night because it seems like the only time you can talk is when I am asleep.
Just get the model number.
And a servant.
Oh no, they are the manager of all the house staff.
I am eating my nut and healthy stuff box.
**I WILL INTERCEPT**
Are you anxious?
Oh wow.
You should delete those photos here.
Where are you.
Yeah.
It went wine with mazen.
It went brine with cucumber.
And your phone.
But you missed the poop.
I will leave for the cleaner and be back in 20 minutes.
Did you finish the message.
Where?
I am hungry though.
Noodle mcpoodle.
What caused it.
Okay classic hangout.
Do you want to send the details?
What will you do?
Uh oh.
It went mine with purchase.
You are not going out?
I am here.
We need a toaster first.
I think it easy to flog a chair at too high of a price.
Also olx.
Which is sad because I think we are not yet comfortable in real life.
Come in.
All plastic, the shape.
And then if you do not find a better one, tell him.
I do not care at work.
I am home.
Oh no.
That is a lot of work for a spare bed.
You will never be the president.
Spacex cultists?
Pfft, moving the rich people off the planet.
Did you miss the double joke?
I am leaving now.
Hmm only some corn.
I just filled up on juice.
The color of a lime?
It is almost my weekend.
My eyes just went huge in a stare way.
Did he friendzone you.
Because it is so hard to tell the model and real value of it.
I think you could go to that store and get loads of similar ones for the same price.
I can not wait for breakfast tomorrow.
Live in.
Housekeeper I think is the term.
Is he crazy.
That is almost how much I paid.
I do not know.
Even the wheels.
I have no other ideas of how to judge a chair.
Yeah, but it does not look like a good on.
But it has honey so I have not had it in forever.
Yeah, it is not practical.
Any people making reusable rockets.
I am here.
Good.
When busy comes, say no.
Oh.
Oh no, you said you were here today.
I think you could get any chair for that much.
It looks all plastic too.
Second hand chairs usually sell for much much lower though.
Not without knowing its value.
Well, yes.
Always around you.
Where is your face?
Do.
I will get in my onesie.
Is it especially good?
I think peanut butter on warburtons sandwhich thins.
Sorry I am so busy.
You said it went okay.
If rushing loses you 300-500 pound, is that not worth not rushing?
What is it.
Hmmm what grain is it?
Maybe if I still highlight the best parts it would be the same.
Oh jeez you had a huge holiday.
Kareem and toka's dad and all the presidents are from there.
It is 7...
I still queue them up though.
Did you see the falcon heavy launch yesterday?
I just confused will and dishes by thinking.
Did you do the voice message.
Yes.
You can amazon chairs to get an idea.
Research.
amazon and ebay.
I think you are my best friend now.
How about we go tomorrow after city stars?
No it is only happiness.
Crunchy nut clusters chocolate was my favourite.
It is so small for 40 pounds.
You.
I am almost tearing and I have not had coffee since the morning.
Okay I have calmed down.
I went to look for screenshot and ended up going through all the old screenshots.
Did you like me more in the past too?
Finish the voice message!
Ah nothing.
Turns out 30c is not hot enough for me any more.
Yeah.
I am always self concious.
But you have selection that way.
I am finished work.
I remember crunchy nut chocolate was delicious.
When you invite me to breakfast.
A breakfast picnic.
Even things she complains about now she said she loved back then.
All the screenshots are of words we said.
I have it bookmarked for later.
Or him?
Or is that molifia.
I do not know what to eat.
I mean, I do not care who is doing it, just fucking hurry up and make a mars colony.
But they do not own the rockets.
Did you see the newer bladerunner film?
But I do not really know anything about it.
But I do not know emojis well enough.
It looks pretty bog standard.
Hazem is crazy.
You are off, right?
But maybe I will try it once.
I am so happy you are here.
I love you.
Sad because Toka seemed to like me so much more before.
Maybe I just saved the highlights.
I was about to object that I had not improved.
I just thought of it as molokheiya but with an f.
Is my ersh too strong?
And that is everyone I see.
I have my box.
Hi Mariam.
I always need to talk to you.
It is not the kind of bed I like.
Sorry, that was too cheesy.
Can you imagine your dad saying goodbye as they move to mars, and leaves you their shitty factory.
It seems like the only time you would be dissapointed in inheriting a factory.
Bad jokes.
Or is she starting her programming training?
Is it the style?
Sore.
How are you?
I await my invitation letter.
WHERE IS THE WEDNESDAY VIDEO
Do you like her?
Mansourah is your countryside.
When are you home?
And the live stream of the car in orbit?
Ah, this is about the only way I could see that going.
President is a brand of cheese.
Is it a play laptop?
COFFEE
Are you home.
"Cairo happened to it"
Yeah that makes sense.
Just work.
Come back.
What I really wrote first there was "I wish the..."
The power went off again.
Yeah I am.
I got hummous, coconut and almond bread, sunflower seeds, baby spinach and bird's eye chillis.
Here I think it is the hottest I will find.
I have been subscribe to scottish scran since the beginning but it is mostly the same after a while.
Well, it is pretty weird seing a car in orbit.
I will do the dishes.
I have no idea.
The first one is better.
Not sure about eslam or kareem.
But there are plenty of people working in the evening.
It was not weak ass.
Nada is going to come around and we will eat a birds eye chilli.
I heard it is an improvement.
But I have not seen either.
Oh I do not know how to spell it.
I am back.
Hmm a monsters of men one.
It is breakfast at the roundabout and then shopping time.
We went to gourmet egypt.
When did he tell you?
I watched it with you, but I think I remember nothing.
Hello.
Wake up.
He told one of a fake number.
I did.
I think clocks should stay still, and it should be up to the member states to shift school/working hours.
Factories are running most all the time.
I managed to find some bird's eye chillies.
You are there all the time.
WHERE ARE YOU.
Nah it was pretty roasting today.
I do not even like it.
I need coffee and food.
I did a celebration dance when he gave me the money and told me.
375gbp is 9200.
And a laundry basket from tulip.
My body is so tired now.
Going to kill my work collegues.
This search result looks very weird with all the one ls.
I think they will leave.
You must end it tonight.
I think baroody is on 3000.
Jesus, last time he told me, it was less than mine.
Are you prepared to die?
I had a birds eye in first year.
It says chilli (uk).
Just one floor though.
Crosscode should be out in half a year, at which point I really recommend it.
Going through my bookmarks to organise.
This guy became obssessed a few years ago.
What am I doing today?
I think I will just stop and listen to music.
I did the dishes.
The power went off.
I got a pay rise for next next year :D
Now I am on 6000, which must be a record for magdy.
I think there is no way he is being payed 9000+ now.
That conversion seems wrong.
I will go eat. Tell me how the people and job is when you get to know things.
It does not matter at all for daylight savings because they can put the shifts whenever.
-e
I did not even know it was one l.
Bring extra noodles, yours are going to be disgusting by the time you are back.
Okay they are not as hot as I remember.
I actually think they have them dried and super cheap in most spice shops.
But the hotness was the exact same.
Yeah, I would rather a eu wide standard.
What.
They use fil fil for every pepper.
Where are you going.
I am here.
You sleep too long.
I have tidied a bit.
I will just eat crumpets.
Hmm he told two days yesterday his salary went up.
It is too late for me.
I tidied a bit.
Whoa redactions.
I know.
The cleaners came and went.
Happens a lot.
I do not want it though.
I will eat here then.
Oh, you accepted the job?
I think other people got rises too.
One of us
6000 is hard enough to believe.
Or maybe I am just used to pounds.
One of the most common hot chillis, yeah.
Well, yeah.
Oh, yeah, I notice now.
I just put on the headphones.
Wake up.
Maybe we can play a game today?
Secret microphone recording scripts in riot.
Just some ones I did not use.
Okay now what do I do.
Yeah, fuck them.
No, a birds eye chilli.
Just chilis, chillis, chiles.
It is fil fil here.
The african birds eye.
But nada and esraa are too.
:(
But I do not want to straight up ask if you want to play a game today.
I love you <3
But paiting a bad building can not make it good.
We should beat the shit out of it.
I organised all my web bookmarks.
I am afraid of being bored.
I am not seeing chilies or chillies.
And swahili has piri piri.
Noodles just went on.
I can.
Hurry.
I tried one of the dried ones last month but did not want them because they tasted like paper.
Did you become the new driver?
Oh wow.
I have to wait until the cleaners come and finish, which will be a minimum of two hours from now.
It is already worth playing.
I am scared to go in the shower in case the cleaner comes.
I think it is one of my favourites.
The colours are nice.
No.
What about in the morning?
What did you have for breakfast?
The cleaner is still not here.
And now I feel more free.
But the code has already been leaked so hahaha apple.
No stop.
Do not be.
And I want it to be a proposition.
Your washing machine is loud.
Yeah, I saw that.
The credit warp time and method changed very recently to this, which is way easier.
And went for breakfast.
The cleaner is meant to be coming but I am starting to wonder.
When did you go to tamara?
And I think I do not have the ingredients or ideas.
They are quite hot.
When I eat one of these chillis, my face burns and tears drip out.
Okay, and crumpets.
Yeah, it is normal.
It is not a police matter unless someone gets injured. Or it was malice.
I am being no comfort :(
But half the story is witheld.
Did you ever see this?
I need to shower, but I have to wait until they finish.
And deleted a few accounts.
They will always have some bullshit stupid response to all evidence.
It is 10ish.
Do you mean pasta?
It is over about an hour.
I am so sleepy.
I took me forever to see the circles at first.
Hi.
Yeah, fuck the building.
I tried to find it as a normal painting but I could not find it.
I think I want hummous.
What are you doing today?
I napped for three hours and only want something light.
Was this last night?
I want to say yes, but no.
The internet has become horrible.
Be fine.
I am aware it is not a question.
I am starting to think they will never come.
No.
Yeah, I forgot to wear my cycling trousers.
How can you bare to be away so long?
I am still scared going round left corners.
No it is a once in a daytime oppertunity.
Oh I have two super concentrate robinsons.
Oh wow.
I want to bake something but I am scared it will fail.
When are you home.
I have a chilli for you to eat tomorrow.
My nose and mouth start dripping too.
:D
I will, I will take two.
And we will see who is really from upper egypt.
I ate all the hummous.
Uh oh.
Oh wow I forgot to open riot all day.
Where are you.
Will you help me get a present for toka's birthday?
What the hell.
Driving is too dangerous.
And too expensive.
I have had two.
Now I need a coffee and shower.
Goodnight Mariak.
I slow down so much.
Right corners I have no fear of.
work work work
I just realised you are not really gone.
"Do you push it out, or in?"
"Push it to the limit"
No facebook.
Hmmmmmmmmm
Yalla home so we can solve the murder.
Are you too scared to drive again.
I mean I can still talk to you.
I think you need to try robinsons so you know what I mean by juice.
What are you doing.
I had hot orange juice.
Cheerio.
WASHING THEN SALADING
Just work still.
No, the orange is tesco.
A megabus.
Hmm.
No, but I can take some for you.
Are you using the earplugs all the time?
I will never drive.
When are you home.
Nope I finished them all.
When we said goodbye I assumed that was the end.
Are you coming.
I know, I am going to sort it out soon.
I want a coffee that has no caffiene.
It is going back to cold tomorrow :(
Or no I want hot juice.
Or "Do you poo shit out, or in?"
I woke up.
Yeah.
Oh wow you are awake.
I need coffee.
Are you in the class?
I am in the work.
I found the drive in my bag.
I have no idea what black magic happened.
I thought it would be colder so I wore a jumper but it is hot.
When do they end?
Hello.
I need to be hotter.
But are you as long as you can?
What.
I am going to bed now.
Or BS 1363.
Then in the big then.
But that is not post.
No breakfast, kareem is off :(
**WHAT IS ALL THIS**
Yeah but just two sandwiches in the morning.
Yep, it is that easy!
And gorilla for sockets.
Hello.
Also I want breaakfast.
And yalla crime to solve.
I have 25 minutes left.
Salad and peanut butter time.
We could build a pretty comforting place.
It is minecraft.
I think we need three, speakers, router, phone.
Hmm, yeah maybe.
Aka never got out of bed.
No I am.
Hmmmm.
I have came across this before.
How can you parse that?
I am home.
Are you finished class.
I am super hungry now.
I am home.
I am not looking out of the window.
What are you doing.
Stop saying hi.
And while you contemplate our future block world.
I am awake.
No, we will remove the original plug, and wire it to a british plug.
Yeah, before 1995 something things in the uk never came with plugs.
It is a Type G plug.
How are you what did you eat what are you doing what did you read.
Checkout Gin for a web framework.
It is roasting.
I added a chilli cut up to the salad so wish me luck.
I think I need coffee too or I will fall asleep.
Do you want to be heavier?
I wish we had a game we played together.
Something that never ends.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Fine fattah.
I do know how to do it though.
Hello awake.
Hi.
I need fatty calories.
Hmmmmm.
Maybe peanut butter and bread.
I am home.
I have salad and peanut butter.
Well that is not fair.
I ate a chilli and I am dying.
And becomes more personal over time.
Ish.
Yeah. We need to change the plug type.
Do you think we can order british plugs from souq?
Probably.
Then post.
Those are http queries.
So megadinner day.
@GET("")ArrayList<Pet> getPets(etc)
Well, yeah.
Kareem calls me paula.
No, my aunt was called it and it is an old fashioned name.
I am not falling for that.
I have another 20 chillis to eat in the next 20 odd days or they will go bad.
I want crumpets but I am all out.
It is not even a fair comparison.
Do you have another cake?
**WHY**
They are such a pain in the ass.
Stop doing so much work :(
Do you have internet permissions?
Yeah?
You you ever get called Mary?
Yes.
Are you home now?
You can not fool me.
It is a Type G plug.
Okay.
No, I am going to starve.
I much prefer Mariam because only you are called it.
I am boiling hot.
When do you finish?
Are you driving?
What.
DId you fall asleep.
You can pretend to sleep so people leave you alone.
I need food.
I will have peanut butter and sandwhich thins.
Take a photo tomorrow.
I am doing nothing.
I will be too bored.
I am super hungry.
When are you home.
Where is your face.
I thought it would be nice if we had a world we could build stuff in, and neither of us have to be there at the same time.
Then we could come home and see if the other person was there, or if not, if they left messages or built things.
But now it is a legal requirement.
There is no feild name.
Oh, I do not like the name Mary.
When do you want?
I am awake.
It is a crime documentary mini series.
What why.
I love the pain?
Do you want to be shorter?
Do you want to live on the moon?
But they are creepy and stupid.
What kind of games would you play?
I will go shower before I pick my entire face off.
Are you home.
@GET("oauth)ResponseType oauth(@Query("grant_type) String type, etc)
And ideally an Authorization header.
It is raining.
I am getting into bed.
People are too noisy today.
Oh no.
Showing bellies was an 80s thing.
Soonononon
You are quite long, but I think if you really put your mind to it, you could grow another metre.
Do you want to be taller?
My body is so tired.
Are your eyes relaxed now?
Are you the cakelady?
What is that cake?
I hope you never speak to that person again.
NOT ME :(
So we were taught in school.
What is your supposed excuse for magdsoft though?
I never bring money though.
I do not remember exactly, but it is a trivial internet search.
Sorry @GET("oauth/token")
But I also think no, never.
And good fucking luck.
The array is not named, and the root object is an array.
This way the root response of the json is an array, not an object.
You want an interceptor for this.
I watch watching all of the episodes of making a murderer.
I miss you too.
I will get breajfast.
How are you getting around?
Is there not a huge part for the belly missing?
Oh four twenty.
I am home.
I am home.
I think I have never had it.
Can I eat camomile?
But I am hunnnnngry.
Where are you?
It feels like week.s
I think some older people have called me paully, maybe.
!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi.
Why are you making typos.
Everyday but Friday and Monday.
But you said no.
I am having peanut butter and sandwhich thins.
You will have an emergency family dinner.
If you were around you would know it happens all the time.
Our cats are super easy to handle.
Hmmm maybe because they are indoor cats.
Bananasaurus was an strong independant cat.
Musl is the only sane libc.
I want to get juice, but ginger is sleeping.
Wake up.
I hope you are awake tomorrow.
Do you not have clases today?
It is the only day me and toka have off together.
Twenty pounds for the dress?
Any day but Friday and Monday.
Okay I will.
I have my feet on the desk and it is on my belly.
I think I need juice.
My appetite just dies when I think of them.
Alpine or void is the best.
I did it with bananas when I was 19.
Hey you never wrote me a letter.
Uh oh.
Ginger is meowing to get her out of bed.
Yeah but is it sticking.
I am usually not fond of remixes.
This j was exactly under my mouse cursor and I was standing at an angle ready to leave.
To the end of work.
I am scared because you never slept last night you will not be here for the rest of the night.
So now you can sleepriot.
The cat made me the bed.
I have not seen you in ages.
What are you doing.
I drank lots of juice and now I am too cold.
What kind of challenges?
I am.
Want to try playing Minecraft on lost.host?
K is next to j.
Can your legs fit in that?
Can your breasts fit in that?
Where is this tea? Let me at it!
And your room.
That would be the worst.
Do you want peanut butter in your salad?
Bed was a bad plan.
I need the big calories.
I kind of want samboosa.
A gap at all is weird, it is not the 80s.
Did you start building our world yet?
But not really sleep because I do not want to leave you alone.
Bananaraus would go out at night.
Did you eat when you got home?
Jeez, 2nd.
I have no idea why, manjaro seems unreliable.
Uh oh the type rate is too high.
You can sing me a song.
Yeah.
It might have been a dream.
Come after university.
Not thursday, Friday.
Does it make you calmer than I do?!
It took me apart and starting rearranging my parts to a bed shape.
Do you want chilli in yours?
I went off pasta and rice a month or so.
It is when I eat too much of something in a short time.
I ate so many bananas in a week, I went off them for 5 years.
Good morning.
I think toka said during the night she might try to come home early because it was valentines but I forgot why.
Are you coming to meet me after?
It is my weeeekend.
You should be finished now.
You can not come back out?
Then again, mint is shit.
Where are you.
What will you do today?
Are you fine?
Yeah.
When are you home?
I do not understand the error :/
Maybe reverse proxying does not work.
I will go pee.
Are you hungy.
I thought you were home for some reason.
No grandfathers or aunts.
These cats meow to wake us up and get out of bed.
And they follow us to bed and sleep on top of our heads or under the blanket.
I feel so sleepy.
No no.
Oh mine too.
Not a lullaby.
I made salad but obviously is is complementary.
Did you get breakfast.
ALMOST HOME, ALMOST BREAKFAST TOMORROW
It supports 1.8 - 1.12.x
It is talking about config files but I see none of that.
Me neither.
Absolutely nothing.
I am scared you will fall.
I will get home hot juice to compensate and more clothes.
Just do it
I am almost finished.
But I was thinking to just check it functions first.
I think I have not set it up fine.
Hmm I managed.
But hold on.
When I run it in the directory as the user, it works fine.
Hmm you can get a crepe for yourself.
I woke up.
Hey did you sleep.
Do you have any ideas?
I will sleep.
No she said she would go to work early to get breakfast.
Yeah it was fucked.
Yes.
Is your day going fine?
Oh hahah I think the process is restarting super fast.
know
I guess hot chocolate.
And my face is water.
But not for teeth.
I forgot to remind you to take a photo.
Yeah.
I might now.
Does it use udp or tcp?
Good morning.
I have a 62 day streak on Duolingo.
It is very hot.
I finished my box.
When was it?
It says you are here but it seems too good to be true.
But no university.
It is not really telling me an error :/
The systemd script I wrote though, looks like it tells it to stop after it has started.
I will open a port directly.
lost.host:11111
Come in.
I had porridge and now my stomach hurts and I am getting sleepy.
And the internet is horrible.
I just set up a cuberite server.
Which I have almost no idea what it is other than a C++ minecraft server.
Not sure.
Loading MojangAPI cache failed: unable to open database file
lost.host:443
It seems to have just started tanking cpu out of nowhere.
Okay it is working now, but it stops straight after loading.
My stomach is going crazy.
I can try later.
Me and Ben set up the lost.host Minecraft server and it runs well on the current hardware.
I am almost downloaded 1.12.2
This I suppose.
Maybe noodles.
Want to play for a bit?
What are you doing today?
Where are you?
I have all night.
Behind the taps and drains.
Or mine.lost.host:80
Shit boooiii
Also turtles in the dev version?
I am listening to music and playing minecraft with ben, but not voice chatting.
You have been gone forever.
Did you migrate?
I think they released a new texture pack if you check mojang news.
So it will never stop.
Hmmm.
They are three different metal hardnesses though.
How are you feeling?
Ready to play in 10 minutes?
I bought cleaning tooth brushes.
Yeah I got it working.
I am at parents.
Come back already.
Regular every day.
This is the third moving you I have.
toka@lost.host `F1resong` does not work.
Starting.
Hi.
alright.
Is there things  Hazem does not like about you?
I want toasted rolls with sunflower spread but as someone who has enough laze to not pee, I can not wait for an oven to cook bread.
I hope I am waiting not in vain.
And coffee.
That was in the last flat.
Come in Mariam.
For cleaning.
Are you going to get rid of her?
I think I am quite already.
I think I know about this.
Will you send all the photos.
But as I watch it more you look too sad.
I took the blanket in and am on the sofa.
Oh yes I will have that too.
It feels too cold today.
Is your shower good?
That was the perfect temperature.
So not a real tooth brush.
Today life is against hla.
With 100% detail.
8 hours sleep, coffee, shower, breakfast.
No, but you mentioned it yesterday.
This is everywhere in our schools.
I should not compare, but I like your face better.
What happened this day?
So I wonder what could have happened.
*Checks how much Mariam is available today*
I do not remember any wooden tables.
I never knew you had a tablet.
I am having my trail box.
We have it on beaches too on rocks.
You do exist!
But Nada is smiling.
But your favorite tshirt is not colorful.
It is all news we do not like.
But it is non stop.
Maybe the playlist made you sleep.
This is one of my favourites recently.
Do you have spinach?
What will you do today?
I will go get food if you promise to.
I miss you so much.
What is it about?
Oh.
Hmmm.
Kirsty never ever stops talking.
100% mariam.
I am here just waiting for you to reappear, and desperate to pee.
I think you could not have slep.
Do you remember the shower at my university.
But I had a chilli just now.
I really like this video.
I am here.
But you owe me a song, an email, a painting of my mouth, a meeting, a tour of the place you live, a picnic, a world we built.
Good morning.
No sleeping, no driving people, no eating out with relatives, no helping your mum clean, no going to the countryside, no playing with hla, no helping hla with homework.
Yes.
This untitled love story one is really good.
I drank juice and now I am freezing.
Hmmm.
What is the last part?
Ur fixed up?
What else did you see?
Today?
Colourful, happy, bright.
I am making a joke.
I say there is no things, I hope you do not think the opposite.
Are you here.
My stomach hurts a little.
What do you have?
Like flying through a cloud.
I am making coffee and had toast.
How do you remember it?
And everything.
Because it is gray.
I would hope not.
Uh oh, come back.
When I became 100% mariam you became 0% paul.
I have not left voice notes in a while.
I am so sleepy.
I am awake, obviously.
Mariam, the sailor woman.
Have you tried many showers?
Hmmm.
Did you prefer it when there was one a day?
I could do this again.
I completely forget which songs I send you, I just send you things I like when I hear them.
I think you knew me when I discovered this shower.
No, it was in the physics and maths building.
What color was the led light?
But it had a black glass table.
I have the coffee.
Get ready for my mood to improve.
<u>Mariam</u>
Your family?
Do they not know you are quiet?
Do you feel any better this morning?
Does hla make you feel bad?
My direct competitor.
1.11 added llamas.
If you put a leash on one, up to 10 llamas will be attracted and try to form a caravan.
Works similar to a chest, but keeps its content when broken.
Shulker box
Shulkers are enemies in the end.
    CTRL+B toggles a text-to-speech engine that automatically reads player chat messages, including the name 
Parrots
Glazed Terracotta and concrete.
But then advancements are client or server?
I have no idea yet.
Are you watching the window?
Next day off is thursday.
Will you make a list of things you want to see?
Come back.
The sun is going away.
Closing the crafting interface with items inside will no longer drop the items in front of you, but will send them instead to the inventory.
Tomorrow.
Laura Marling?
Jeez, she is going to have a hard time later in life.
She has everything to do and all the time.
Please be fine.
Why does Nada never take her?
What...?
Do primos do fateer?
Will you take a taxi?
Maybe.
Though the storing of which recipes are unlocked, server.
That code is useless.
No you are never ugly at all ever.
It looks more peaceful than my view.
Where are you?
That kind of seems like it should be client side.
It is barely started and dead.
"But I am broken to, and spoken for, do not tempt me" I think this line is well known.
Where are you.
And everything is new.
I had more coffee.
Do we want to order something tonight?
These socks look too cold.
What are you doing?
What is it.
I have these soft date round things.
Will you be home in time?
It is here so yalla.
Good morning.
I see nothing in the issues.
Is this your house..................................................
I think you just upgraded rich level.
Baby.
I am hungry.
I really want more coffee, a shower and a hot water boter and hot chocolate.
Of what?
Why?
The invisible player problem is known and the cause is unknown.
Going to have to limit our powers though.
From hamza I guess.
Shader packs were shit.
Hmm nope.
Hello.
Like a cold maybe, but very early.
They used to be client side.
I will turn on audio notifications so I know when you message.
Whoa.
I am here and only here.
Installed forge client side.
Maybe this place?
Added the essentials plugin.
I still have spread.
Me and ben are playing.
Will you send photos all day?
I should send my tooth brush color.
No idea when and how I will get anything.
Is it camera time?
Where are you.
Where are yours.
Okay let me see.
I know this song.
Or you told me about it.
Nervous or angry?
Do you want more photos?
It was my birthday present from my sister.
How much was the order?
Do you have university today?
But not from the last place.
Made an automatic sugar cane farm.
Just fateer.
I am at work.
When coffee is not working, it usually means I am about to get ill.
No `\\`
My feet are a bit uncomfortable.
But only 30 minutes left.
I will be yes.
Are you coming home early.
It looks tasty. But is it cheese.
I only had dairy free cheese in a baked thing once and it was great.
I like eating it 1s out of the oven.
Nobody has microwaves here.
Just mushrooms and vegetables, there is no other option.
Going to try a shader pack.
Did the guy give a reason?
I think I might be ill.
No no it is minor.
It is fine really.
I have been pretty content.
How is Hla?
How are you?
The internet is so so so bad and it is stressful.
The latest in a while.
I have no idea how to calm you.
I am not there.
Oooo the only family in Egypt with a microwave.
I think you need a onesie.
Will that not make you sleep?
My body is so tired.
Toka is home with Nada.
What on earth.
Oh god.
Tired :/
Toka got the g4 plus and it has been perfect.
I just have to finish this one thing.
I thought you had a moto.
What is my plan?
And when you ask about them they seem to think it is some type of cancer machine.
I have my box of food and hot juice.
I had the chilli.
But they kept the cake again.
I think they are throwing me a suprise party.
Still at work.
He is the longest staying employee here.
What did you have last night?
Without an excuse they are asking for 0 star ratings.
Your sleeping confuses me.
How are you?
In between.
Oh not for you.
I have vegetable fateer from yesterday.
What does it look like?
Did hla eat it all?
Want to play?
Are you home.
No not tonight.
Sleeping.
How jammy is that?
I think you slept already.
Nope.
I am at work.
What makes you happy?
It is never bad.
Nobody can remember 30+ secure passwords.
It was weird because everyone changed since last year.
But chunk loaders are not a thing.
Yeah, I always struggle on a saturday.
How is your weekend?
I have not been looking recently.
Get the moto g5 or whatever number it is on.
It is okay.
But when is home arrived, food eaten, and resting.
Another country?
I am home.
The fateer is cooooooold
Okay I cooled down and now I am freezing.
Hmmmmm.
I just had it on grilled toast and sandwhiches.
But it will be cold.
This looks exactly like a previous on but creepier.
Nope do not be sorry.
You can say to my photos that I always wear the same thing.
Maybe a year of being here.
We have no water.
Hmmm.
Come in.
It is super cheap and has the best value for money.
What?
Are you alive.
I told her.
Are you home now?
Tell me everything.
I am waiting each day.
Did you have it yet?
I think I want hot juice.
I want something very filling.
Be here.
I want to go home.
Will you send it in an hour?
It was eslam's birthday party.
Hello Mariam.
I think we should breed llamas they have almost 2 per I think.
Where is it broken?
Is it okay if I give you a late birthday present?
Well, when I get my status here sorted out we can start looking.
What you did, how you feel, how you feel.
I am here.
Why are you not singing all the songs.
Yeah I got 8 peices.
Uh oh.
It has been a long day.
Why do I not have it.
They held a party for Eslam.
He is only 20.
What do I eat and drink.
Leave the identity server alone.
I have an idea but it is difficult.
Oh show Riot.
I remember the acts during it and I was angry at the acts, it was way way to detailed.
I was not here at 5am.
Oooo youuuu tcher there bepah
It was a pizza thing Ben made.
Did you eat all of this?
Where did you go.
I am sorry for saying creepy.
They always do it.
Do not sleep.
This sounds good enough to be the real vocals.
No, different different.
<3
Use a password manager.
4 years.
Onions, lentils, carrots?
:(
Lisa can show you.
What do you have?
And even then `'https:/matrix.org` is not a url.
I had a dream that me and toka had a foursome. And in the dream after it I was so angry at the other guy. I woke up and checked it was a dream and was very relieved.
:(
Toka is home for an hour and off out.
I will be back soon.
I think I forgot to dump them though.
How is your day?
Did you pick up paracetomol?
Oh you look different.
It is the glasses.
I am home.
Do we have lentils?
I was talking about lisa.
Where is your face?
Which animal would you have on your onesie?
My eyes are streaming.
Okay it wore off.
What are you doing?
No.
I mean there are here.
Good morning.
I think I have a suprise party here.
Maybe.
It is a suprise.
It is his forth year here.
It was eslam's birthday party.
And last year I knew no one.
I should have the next 2-3 hours.
Uh oh.
Did you have soup.
I still feel hungry.
they
I will listen in about an hour.
We had some cake at her parents two days ago.
They get you a cake, offer you two slices, then keep the rest for themselves.
It is fine, I do not like birthdays.
We can do something on thursday.
I noticed the start of the metro entrance.
Baaaaby.
I will be later.
I am going home.
Do you want to pick up those little straight pasta things to make soup with?
No, we have loads.
Are you fine.
I had chilli and my face is a fountain.
Llamas are neutral mobs which can be tamed and used to transport large shipments of items.
You can put a carpet and a chest on a llama.
I am at work.
But happy.
With what...
I had cake so my stomach is going to die.
Anyway, off home now.
Do we have soup in the freezer?
Are you up.
You said it was really good last night.
You get three choices, right?
Yeah, but before it was random.
Here it tells you, right?
I am coming in five minutes.
Do you want to drop out of the window?
What no.
Well, there is no end game.
What time are you home?
I am making lentil soup.
Did you heat it up?
Remember you need to name a tool in order to keep it from breaking.
I am having hot juice.
I will start cooking at 9:30.
Just researching it.
**Some of it up.
What the fuck.
How do you feel?
Are you blocking hla out?
/0I[3?
I just killed 8 cows 18 beef and 1 leather.
Toka is ill.
Did you really boil it?
Yeah.
What did you get for yours?
Do we have?
Where is the noise now?
What the hell.
But I think it is good we have many tools.
No not yet.
I feel like I need a shower.
I will start.
Wake up.
We need leather prompto.
I do not know.
What is different?
You had two level 30s?
Why. What did you do?
Want **TO PLAY** ~~?~~
I am home.
I feel hungry.
I will be on tonight for a bit.
You have already been awake 12 hours.
Nothing happened at all?
I am here.
Can you put 30 lapis in?
Going to need some item frames for our legend tools.
My body is a bit tired.
Is it a long show?
Was it a university bus or a normal bus?
Did you use the earplugs on it?
When will you hear my voice message.
It is long.
What is wrong?
hahaha
NO WHY IS IT OPEN
You had it before the soup.
And you boiled it, which makes it super impossible.
And when I got unchanged he did not wake up.
I have the ear plugs in at work.
Read the instructions again.
Are you ready to watch me eat breakfast tomorrow?
Coming home.
Who knows.
The place is far though.
Jesus, I slept already.
I taught her how to shaft mine, dark oak doors look fancy as shit.
I accidentally restarted the server this morning.
So it beat the java one to the port binding.
They are interupting my singing.
Then he did.
I will get into bed but be here and I will.
Are you alive.
But I wish I had music too.
WHOOPS
I am pretty sure food poisoning from vegetable soup is almost impossible.
Yeah that is true.
It is over yet?
I fixed it now.
Could you make it fall off the end of a track, land on top of a torch, with a hopper underneath?
Oh wow, do I have to send the money back?
I caught crazy sleeping when I came home.
He never came to the door, but ginger did.
I can hear you.
And I never disabled the cuberite service.
Food poisoning takes 48 hours to kick in.
If the internet allows, I will join.
I am home and here.
One moment.
I want breakfast so much.
We need an intervention.
I was late today too.
When everyone sets their password to 123456, he can just log into their account.
But that is a trust violation.
The cat hit the medicine info sheet on the floor last night.
No, I will be late today.
There has not been a thursday free yet.
Can you hear me?
I will fall.
I hear it through my body only or something.
What will I eat?
Work or anything else.
Anyone with the password 123456 deserves to be hacked.
Magdy just ordered me koshary.
What are you studying?
I can not see the smile though.
Talk or meeting?
All you eat is tuskan these days.
Change your name to `Kareem`
I am not sure.
Did you finish.
Wake up.
Food poisoning is not that bad either. It is pretty common.
Are you at work?
Hurry.
When are you home?
ibu profen will be good for the core pain.
Where are you today?
Magdy chose taiga though.
Are you sure the person baroody sent the messages to did not show him?
Yes.
I have actually seen this film and it is dire.
We need to cook the spinach soon.
Toka just came home.
So it is food and getting ready to sleep time.
When are we really going to hangout.
Be here.
I want to be way hotter.
Also, move to take the maximum the instructions say, and when.
Me.
He would have to access the postgres database, which does not work with phpmyadmin.
My best guess is he logged in as their account.
No, here.
Stop taking it.
I have no audio.
I am not sure yet.
I started a mine shaft at the north island and immediately hit an existing mine on the lef.
Toka is a bit better.
In which language?
Only talk to me here from now on.
The cat hit it on the floor.
And how to use the mine cart system.
Also, they must be defined as a data holder now, so they are obligated to let you access and delete your data.
I am awake.
Did you sleep?
We are playing now.
Playing minecraft with ben and toka.
Maybe it has only been a day.
I really like the sound my keyboard makes with ear plugs in.
What your really want is to finish the message.
But the admin interface does not have that feature.
What are you doing.
I am still at work :/
Well, in a few minutes.
Oh no I wish.
I am trying for a looting sword to get extra leather.
Oh wow.
Did you eat?
But your head goes out of the top in some of them, it is odd.
My throat hurts.
I think I will in a moment.
I think the villager despawned because you were the only one on.
Oh wow that was early.
Toka just went to work.
But it has no leaves.
This is too much time.
Come see me instead.
The diarehae stuff.
I think it says stop, see the doctor, and be informed not to drive.
Hmmmm.
What are you doing today?
Yeah, but I do not use it.
Rent and bills comes to 90gbp a month.
I never answered.
Was it worth it?
**HAPPY BIRTHDAY**
From lisa?
I fancy ginger bread.
I just went for breakfast.
Oh yes this is one of my favourites.
Oh yes it is now.
The colours of this avatar remind me of maha's one.
I get 243gbp a month, toka gets 162gbp, for a total income of 405gbp a month.
Just for transparency's sake.
*Mummy takes a sneaky cut*
The only thing that makes me think that is egypt is the road missing markings.
It even has a wheelie bin.
I will just search harder.
Are you trained yet?
What did you do today?
Toka is about to learn to craft.
Hmmm I want toast now.
I had a dream that the breakfast stand was not there.
I will shower and get coffee and I do not know.
It is the sun in your eyes look.
More centered would be good.
Which one?
Oh you went to the bottom?
Are you currently on?
The film was nice.
I miss you.
The exchange rate is now 1 to 25 :/
Are you off today.
Hla is adorable.
Can you make a request for all the internet history data the uk government have collected on you under the the freedom of information act?
We do.
Hi.
Good morning.
Wake up.
I have no food today.
Yeah it is.
Hmm.
**and visa application numbers**
And that depends on the UK being in the EU.
When are you home?
Have been for an hour actually.
Yeah, I am on.
To that account, it is basically the same as a bank account.
I can give you the sort and account number.
Paying for your own birthday present :D
Where are you.
Eww marketing.
But I suppose until I find a job.
I use the Brittish prepaid visa account.
Which makes our rent 57gbp.
And I had a shower and coffee.
We have one of these trees outside our window.
Your mum phoned.
And the incompetence to get the wrong name.
It should not.
We are watching the handmaiden.
Are you going out to eat?
Wake up.
Account number :02520348Sort code :623053
Where are you though?
Yeah the 40 is there fine.
Did you go to the training?
Shitty time to not be on the register.
Is it toka@lost.host?
And it will have to be sent.
Why do you have two passports?
Playing with ben.
Sure, but the pay would not be anywhere near enough to live.
Beetroot soup can not be stacked.
Are you sleepy?
Are you sleep.
I am too lazy to go out.
Do you have the application number?
But I would mention that I am living here, in Egypt, and give that address too. And correct your name.
I think you should reply though.
Maybe something like this:
Your passport changed in the mean time?
I would mention that in the response.
I am not on the electorate register if they are going to check that.
Just our application number.
They have a copy of my passport which proves I have right of abode in the UK.
I told her to say that.
Ireland could be better.
Oh you can see the game in the background.
What else can you see.
Mmmmmm.
I am off Thursday and Friday.
Not there yet.
7 days to respond when they took a year and a half?
While the address is not required at all.
Nope.
I am just cooking porridge.
`11 King Street, Lossiemouth, Moray, Scotland, IV306PZ`
I think it is best to wait for the result and then think about it.
What does this mean?
Are you home.
I am afraid they are just going to reject it then tell you to apply using the new info.
And if not, they will require the new document.
We just got a response from ireland.
Wrong name, but correct application umber.
I said to just reply honestly and say I have been living at this egyptian address for 2 years.
Toka will.
But practically 1-2 years.
I am making porridge.
I really want breakfast :(
I was off today.
That was the longest meeting of all time.
Also, yeah what.
And what is the password?
Also, they are illegally late by 1.5 years, and then they have the audacity to tell use they will withdraw the application within 7 days.
I think if they do accept it, we have six months to enter.
How is your illness?
My address should not matter one bit.
Finding a place to live and work will be quite a challenge.
I think legally 6 months.
Did you forget to log out?
What did you do.
You enjoy going out with nada's friends?
I woke up.
I will be back soon if you are free.
Hmm the clock is fucked.
What on earth.
Where are you even getting these thoughts.
Are you spending too much time around Hla?
No.
No breakfast :( :(
I do not know.
He was going to order but they do not deliver today.
Okay order arrived and I am fed.
Wake up.
I am home.
I am home.
I am so hungry.
I do not often get bad dreams.
Just exploring dreams.
I will be ready in 15 minutes or so.
I just have to get food.
Porridge time.
I downloaded celeste last night.
Are you home.
They are pretty difficult in vanilla.
Mariam.
Why.
Yeah it will take 20 minutes.
5 minutes alone to clean everything up.
Yes.
Then you would be able to dive to your house.
How are you.
Help.
And near the end too.
I am so knackered.
Are you okay after you wake up?
I want sambosa but it is impossible.
Are you not tired when you try?
I can not see it.
I never trust doctors here these days.
I am fine.
How do you remember them?
Do you want to remember them?
I know, white shoes with brown trousers is high contrast.
You can get a map of visa on arrivals for uk, and egyptian citizens from wikipedia.
I hope it is just a spot.
Just hungry.
Because every time someone I know went to them here, they were useless.
They never seem to care about a correct diagnostic.
I just finished now.
Are you okay?
Lots of rolls.
Hmmmmmmmmmm.
You fell zzzleep.
Hmmmmm.
I shaved my head yesterday.
I had my onesie hood up.
Ginger is sleeping in the carry case.
I am scared for you.
They never test enough.
Half way through I gave a command to send me a keyword.
I feel sore and awful everywhere.
No, my mouth waters.
Jesus yeah that might work.
Just when toka is here, I do not call anyone because we do not have that much time together.
I told my mum and she said, "Really we are due snow".
I am hunnnngry.
I am here.
Were where you?
Yes.
Usually no one wears white trousers so it sticks out.
I have onion fingers.
No.
Not to have by itself.
10 minutes to cook everything.
They fucked up and had to amputate toka's granny's foot.
My stomach is really killing me.
Though, I think I did eat enough.
My razor ran out of charge half way shaving my head.
I will eat.
Yes.
I am awake.
When can you really meet though.
But the end should work well.
I am fine yes.
Are you here.
I am home.
I would be so fucking angry.
Now I had porridge.
I have half hair.
Where did you go.
It does not hurt.
What are you doing.
Hi.
Nah.
Nonono
Are you there?
What do you think about falling asleep?
I like the more blendy brown or black.
I think with wings, you can make a hole in the glass dome, with loads of stacked beds at the bottom.
I will be on in 20 minutesish.
5 minutes to eat it.
I have porridge.
I think I did not eat enough.
Last night I had spinach and rice.

My stomach really hurts.
Will you get food today?
It is neutral.
I will look tonight.
You are always there.
**HUGE SALES**
I always think white is too showy.
I do not remember now.
I mean from cutting them yesterday.
This is my dream currently.
Oh wow, nice.
I am home.
I am not sure.
I will not eat quite yet.
But you never sent the secret command messages.
I think toka is coming home with food.
When are we going to meet.
google `visa requirements for british nationals` and the same for egypt.
You do not want a cooco stomach.
Hmmmm.
Are you fine?
I have a lump below my ear.
They just fuck up or tell them to get antibiotics.
Okay but back to normal thoughts.
This morning I had the normal breakfast.
Just what to do right now.
I hated that so much.
Then it took me 15 minutes to find the charger.
I have a 70 day streak on Duolingo now.
Oh I have not had that in ages. I forgot about it.
I am going to see how long I can hide I have no hair from toka.
Then it shoots you up like a spring 100 blocks in the air.
I had to put earplugs in, it is way too loud here.
It does hurt.
Did you finish my voice message?
No no I am full.
It was such a relief when it was all over.
I am at work now
I really have no idea.
I had a dream I was staying the night because my sister was in hospital, but for something really non serious. Then in the morning I had to convince my grand mother to get braces because my grand father was telling her it was too dangerous and could kill her. Although she has false teeth.
I am home.
Two flavours of the biggest packs.
And I thought it was you expecting snow.
48*2
And my stomach is so sore.
I am not sure what to do.
I will go shower.
HURRY WITH THE SURPRISE
I shaved my feet too, and cutting the nails now.
Everything from the bakery.
Can we make the bittengen in pepper and lemon sauce again.
What did you get for breakfast?
Oh I forgot.
Obviously not tuna.
96 should let her put on an extra stone.
On the one hand, I trust panasonic abide by strict water standards of other countries.
What are you doing.
Are you home.
Oh no, it gets uncomfortable.
I will be home soooooon.
Is there anything?
I keep seeing lightning but no sound.
Should arrive 1st.
Are you in the rain.
Almost any time, with thursday, monday, then the rest being the order of can not meet.
Toka has Monday off these days.
Oh this is a much better dream.
South korea was the place with the highest quality of life.
I am relying on you to wrap it mummy.
Hi.
Are you fine?
This is the usual one.
But mostly fine.
And hide it from toka as a joke.
She only noticed this morning.
Wikipedia gives you a map.
I actually do not know what it tastes of.
Pfft, you are rich, what are you on about.
Okay.
Normal ones are only 16gbp for 48.
Maybe a box of each?
They have given me like 5-6 trails now.
I must have built 5-6 elytra launchers today.
1st march.
I am thinking about getting lisa a stupid amount of food that she likes that does not go off.
Like 10 boxes of coco pops.
I have no idea, she can buy anything she wants already.
I used free amazon prime trail to get 1 day delivery.
I did.
I am suspecting it is because of the roof.
It just rained.
I am okay so far I think.
I do not remember spending anything this month.
I am so tired I might end up sleeping.
I think not.
I got confused.
Wait, caramel ones, or normal ones?
I will rebuild the current one outside at some point.
I think it was warm today.
Good morning.
I have never heard of it.
Booking a month before is around the cheapest time.
Yeah everywhere looks amazing there.
Holidays require the time period off's notice.
I got the blanket on the couch.
Did you hear the thunder.
I am waiting for lighting and rain now.
It rained a little then went away.
Yeah I know.
Are you here.
They email you before, and even if you cancel after they charge, you get the money back.
Paul Meredith.
It feels like we just said good morning.
Where did the day go.
I am almost out of Robinsons now.
I have the little ones, I am just saving them though.
Minecraft in 20 minutes?
Then go home.
I am so tired.
Hi.
I mean that is a month rent for one day.
If you want two weeks off, you must give two weeks notice.
If you could back us up while we found work, I think so.
We just got thunder.
I ordered my sister 96 chocolate eggs for her birthday.
No.
Hmmm.
How much do I have left.
This is the only other one really.
But maybe looking at the reviews from amazon directly would be better.
When are you home today.
I am home.
I am having bread with spread by myself.
This is still a long way off.
They thanked toka for sending the info and sent the details to the processing officer.
I would be too worried moving there on our savings currently.
None of them worked.
I am tempted to order more bottles.
Just made coffee.
I am not sure.
In egypt.
I have no idea where it is.
Yeah, they do not have to give you the holidays.
And if something happens with Ireland, every plan could change.
I am hiding under the blanket.
But the fresh ones, and out of the pods.
Tomorrow is thursday.
250GB for a dollar a month.
They go deep.
<u>RED WARNING</u>
I will not.
What is it like now?
We had lighting yesterday.
27 days has Februrary every 64 years.
Where to?
I had 5 rolls.
Bring mega noodles?
My stomach feels sore.
Wait for all the cars and houses to melt it.
This page does not load.
You should look up a video online.
You should not tell lisa that though.
Where are you.
I might end up.
Seoul probably.
Probably but it is too far away.
You can pay three months wage with one day work.
A month is not last minute.
But it cost 5 pound.
10 pound is too much.
At least.
What the hell that is not a layer of snow.
Today is okay.
All breakfasted.
Are you not putting them in far enough?
And you roll them very tight and quickly put them deep.
Yeah, it is.
Photos would be much better.
That looks red to me.
Divide, the right, whatever.
Have you not put antiseptic on it and covered it?
But I am half asleep.
Thursday is the least ideal day.
Why can you not come today.
Why no.
Lossiemouth has quite a lot of snow.
Heavily showers of paratroopers.
Okay.
How is the snow now?
Driving in snow and using your phone?
The app just crashed
Are you excited for your present tomorrow?
cm
6pm.
I am at work.
Why is it not a *BLUE WHITE AND RED* warning.
Who also hates me.
There was lightning here last night.
I AM UNSURE WHAT DAY IT IS
WHERE IS THE VIDEO
Waiting for breakfaaaaaaaast.
I know the ones.
I do not remember
xom
Which is the same as hail.
I am taking fool to work.
If I can ever bother to go.
I already started eating the beans because I can not wait.
Go here instead.
Yeah but that is on the brink of a **RED** warning.
It is my weeeeeeeeekennnnnnnnnd.
I am home.
It happens once or twice a year.
I knew I was not making up "cold" storage.
My weekend is here.
But that would trigger change.
I mean, the fact you are calling it the tory party gives credence to how long standing the party is.
What is the C&U party?
After that will be the conservative and fucking respect the queen alright party.
It is all anticommunist propoganda.
Are you home yet?
I was joking because you take people there all the time.
How is the **RED**?
It was quite far away though.
Oh for fuck sake.
Yeah it froze the ui while downloading.
I need someone to drive me to Cairo Festival Mall.
ALMOST
Like peachy.
I should be awake then.
Oh wow towerfall and celeste are the same guy.
What will we eat tonight.
Wake up.
I slept too long too.
We are cleaning out rubbish.
Moving furniture and cleaning.
Oh wow that is weird.
On you keyboard, if you hold a letter, it repeats, then hold shift, what happens? Then let go of shift, what happens?
Who the fuck decided it would be a good idea to let people run commands as root.
Yalla do it now.
No no that can not happen.
I have been getting snow videos and photos all day, everyone is very excited :D
I am calling.
All these people died because of the snow.
You would think he would be curious.
That does not look like digging.
I forgot how op paladin was.
I am hungry.
Why change when you can just wait in limbo.
Is poppy not freezing.
I had all the rest of the bakery stuff.
Grave traps.
I have not even had coffee yet.
Come in.
Once the cars were under the snow in Edinburgh.
What the hell is FaceTime?
Wifi is always shit.
Was it this morning?
Are you using a heated lens to keep your fingers warm?
I got lisa 96 cream eggs for her birthday.
We have only the bed in the bedroom now.
We had to take the wardrobe apart completely and it was a huge huge task.
I am so so full.
I ate too many pizzas.
500 pound gone in a second.
I feel like it would be hard to know why someone changes without seeing them every day.
Are you fine.
Wake up.
Be here.
Or actually, we can video call tomorrow.
Having the chocolate mint now.
For tonight?
What are you doing?
Infrared alert.
Red light alert.
The other room has the dresser, and wardrobe, and a sofa, and the washing, and anything to do with clothes.
Yeah.
**Wake up.**
My internet is too slow right now.
Not before 9?
Oka.
Oi.
Happy birthday.
Did you learn to put them in fully?
Where is the photo.
Going for breakfast and then after that I am ready.
Maybe in an hour.
I do not get how he could lose interest in you.
I am waiting for our meeting.
And I have rolls with sunflower spread.
Did you listen to the playlist.
You will have to video lisa opening it.
No point buying you present if I do not get to see you open it.
Need coffee.
The trees and the blue sky really trick you.
Are you keeping them clean?
Did you listen to the song?
I am sure she is going to get so sick of them she will never have them again in her life.
It seems weird.
Trustico, who just requested 23,000 of their ssl certificates to be revoked.
No way can you be that hungry.
I miss miss miss miss miss you.
I have no willpower.
Crazy and ginger were sleeping in their bed for the last 4 hours.
Huurrrry.
What time?
Cheerio.
As in you can not sleep?
We are moving furniture and clearing things out.
Yeah, she opened them this morning.
Red alert 2.
Are you fine today?
I am playing so much.
All my muscles hurt from yesterday.
But after you are done with it I will be asleep.
It will only take 10 minutes.
10 hours.
I am too lazy to make coffee.
Playing Heroes of Hammerwatch with Ben.
When I spend almost a day without talking to you I remember, and I panic that we no longer talk any more, then I talk to you.
I P awake.
Just old things.
That looks incredible.
What focal length are you using for these?
You get so close.
She always liked them.
Hahahaha
And their site went down.
Where is it.
Be home.
Yeah I was wondering why I could not connect to chat.
I feel sad and I am just waiting for you.
Hi.
It seems like you have not been happy with it for ever now.
<3
We put the cat bed in the bottom of the wardrobe.
I will make a playlist.
Why is there not a snow man in sight?
I am all fed.
That is a bit early.
I was like that with my bike.
What will you do today?
Still no snowman.
The ending is fantastic.
Because I am usually not on the computer or phone when I go to bed.
Okay lets start the third together.
I have orange and pineapple juice.
Not at all.
What comes up as the suggestions when you type that on a phone?
And the number of letters is the same.
How is your day going.
Up for some hammerwatch?
Nope.
Pain to whom exactly?
I am at work.
It was the playlist description.
But they know nothing of who the playlist was for.
When did this happen.
Will you always tell me when you are not feeling okay?
And they sleep in there now.
What are you doing?
I am at work.
Okay.
I am back to normal now though.
I am going home.
I think it might be mega noodles night.
1.2.3.**Play** Pause Stop
You countdown.
It is for one listening.
There is one 10 minutes left.
only
You will have to thank my mum for that.
I said okay.
When are you home?
Homehomehmohem
What is memories forgotten?
Wait at the beginning of the forth.
I had one before work for the first time in Egypt.
I listen to it a lot.
This user sent me a private message.
Toka was asleep 59 minutes ago.
I am not sure.
Or it is spam. But I have never had spam like that and it is very specific, and Google shows no similar messages.
I think someone is creeping on me who at least knows me.
I really like our new clothes room.
Come back.
Are you ever coming home.
What is it.
The washing.
I am home.
I typed `poweroff` on the wrong terminal when I left work.
When are you home.
I got to the third song.
Are you at unverzagt?
Toka arrived home.
Okay make it a streak.
As long as my duolingo streak.
He attacked my dad anonymously.
My dad reported it to the police.
My grandad also creeped on my twitter which made me delete it.
Yeah how would he know who that playlist is for.
Do you hate Mariam?
The account they have was made just for the message.
But it was reported to the police.
I think he could blame me.
I have been living a secret persona of Andy for the last six years.
They never replied to me telling them I am not Andy yet.
I put my earplugs in with my headphones on because I hate roof dogs.
Why are you not coming here?
Yes, coming home in 15.
I have started wearing the ear plugs almost all the time.
Did you not start?
He could search for toka, then find me.
I think that rules my family out.
My mother is the only person who knows you but still she would not know who the playlist is for.
I received an accusing private message this morning. 
Are you fed.
Shattoura okay.
One girl or woman in 1870ish could produce 3,000,000 sewing needles in a week operating four machines.
I was sore from all the furniture.
This has to be you, toka or hazeem, or other.
What do you think?
He never admitted it.
Are you at work.
Going hooooome.
Eugh.
Is it finished.
Did it help.
Okay.
Why are you not on the bus.
The safest speed is the speed of everyone else.
Mariamrimarma.
Oh wow.
The device list shows loads of riot.im/app and vector.im/betas.
Tell me when exactly and I will listen too.
Why am I so cold.
No it is finish the playlist time.
Why.
We always say good morning though.
How do you know?
I just went the way we go when we go for breakfast.
In the description I wrote, "You are not alone.Do not be alone.I won't let you be;I love you."
I do not know.
My uncle send an attacking facebook private message to my dad, anonymously.
Does he blame me?
I replied with:
I am just glad it is not for me.
I have not taken it out yet.
You said not to forget to take out the washing.
You said shatoour.
I am here too.
play list play list
Where did you get to.
And who would know who that description is directed to.
I think there are a very small number of people who would know my SoundCloud and have enough context to make judgements there.
My uncle has a history of this.
But I have not heard from them in a long long time.
He never admitted it but it was obvious.
Come back.
If it is spam, then it is nonsense.
She thinks it is nonsense and I should just block the account.
Why did Hazeem lose interest in you?
Could it be your sister or a parent or family member?
Maybe one of toka's friends.
No idea who Narges is.
But that does not stop them making a new account.
andybenard1@gmail.com it all makes sense now.
I really hope they are not rubbish.
Will they find out about me?
What did you get?
I would be very.
Not legally.
Do you want to look the whole process up again?
I would become more aware of the law we are applying under. Find that document for processing officers, and quote the sections that state they must not ask about savings.
Yes. I think you should focus on other people.
I switched three work hours today with wednesday.
That sounds dodgey.
Fix it chemically is what medication is doing.
In Cairo Festival mall though.
That seems unlikely. It was two messages, and quotes the playlist description I sent you.
It is attached.
But it angers someone.
I am not sure it is possible for a random person to do that.
Maybe Narges was an autocorrect.
Mariam's relationship with Hazeem died and I made her a playlist to cheer her up.
Some anonymous account.
It was public.
Soundcloud.
I feel like it is some creep.
I told toka about it all.
Two people in my family creeped before.
My biggest suspect is still Hazeem.
I am going to recreate the playlists on a new account and make them private, but do not follow it, you can bookmark the page.
And it is funny.
WHAT IS IT
Was it easy to talk about things.
I am back.
Someone does.
The beginning is close to Mar
It attacked his character and past.
But the English is good, and Mariam said he would be asleep at the time it was posted.
> You have the wrong person. I am Paul Meredith, I live in Egypt. It was directed towards @marmorad.I am guessing Narges is the user called anyway which I followed back last week because I liked the music they posted. But I have no idea who they are.If you want proof of my identity, you can make a challenge of your choosing.
And I was finally caught.
Which is funny.
And I told him he can challenge me to prove my identity.
What will you talk about?
What are you doing until 7?
Oh wow it is almost 7.
How long is it?
I usually talk to you, toka, my mum, and sister about everything.
We can send two copies.
Yeah, but scanned.
What the fuck.
He can not make up.
And I never sent the playlist to anyone.
And my grandfather creeped on my twitter, which was when I went private.
I think it rules out all of my family.
I do own the email address andybenard1@gmail.com.
I am so glad to be home and relaxing.
I try to be open all the time.
Will I start counting?
It is near to your home?
It does.
You should get that pdf printed out.
Please provide evidence that you can financially support the visa applicant when resident in Ireland (attach supporting documentation, for example, bank statement)
Tho
If it is not spam, and the person is rational, then they are accusing me of having you and Mariam.
Which would mean they need to know I am married to you, and know the playlist was for Mariam.
Who really does know us.
Block does not work because they will make a new account if they really are creeping.
He lost interest in Mariam, but never gave any reason, and it slowely faded.
AC IS ON
Hahahahahahahahaha
They sent this.
bandypauldron
Everything by Borrtex is incredible. 
I am so sleepy.
Will you send you?
She is now.
Are you making samboosa?
I woke up when she came home at 11, then slept again until she finished everything.
No, the form.
Would you be able to write a letter explaining you are willing to support us financially until we are working, and provide statements of your income?
0 is sufficient by the law.
We are going to familiarise ourselfs again with the law and requirements.
37C this week.
Hahahahahaha
I replied to the messages this morning saying, "Go on, make your case."
Do reassure the person that they have the wrong identity.
They still think I am Andy.
I am home.
Have it on my desk by 6am tomorrow morning.
**BACK OFF YOU CANT STOP ME**
I will have bitengengen.
You never answered any of the questions.
A bank statement is not needed...
When do you get paid?
I remember all advice saying not to answer these questions.
-37?
They should know I am not Andy.
I will need a transcript of the session.
This is your last chance, Morad.
Ate all the date things.
I will have all the rolls.
Just to spread feelings out and react as a group.
Did she lead?
How are you getting home?
Are your nails done.
Mariamiram
None of this is required :/
What is your bank balance like?
They need proof I have access to enough money to support toka in Ireland.
I think we should not provide any evidence of savings or income.
But only 8.
Well, in total.
Not even that hot.
I went and spent my spare money for last month.
Do your poos smell less?
Why am I so sleepy.
I slept.
The fatier option.
Yes, it does not take long.
ves
That's because that is the end.
Where are you.
What did she say about your nightmares?
But to just claim it is the medication you are taking without being aware of the studies, seems a bit vague advice.
Toka spends her 2000 in the first day.
Could you take a bus instead.
Where does the bus go?
Are you anxious about the session?
What did you talk about?
Is it samboosa night.
Wake up.
If I remember correctly, it is illegal for them to request proof of income.
Maybe read our statement back at the beginning to jog your memory.
They are using a general form, that is not applicable to our application type.
I am close to overtaking your sister on duolingo.
I think the dreams are because you have many bad thoughts.
Cosmetics.
You were just curious?
Does the driver wait for you?
What were you doing in Alexandria?
It is so loud.
Fuckers are not allowed to judge this on income.
We have 21 days to fill in this info.
Do not let him.
I got orange juice, olive oil, apples, a big plastic bowl, a scouring pad, three super fancy metal sponge scouring pads, the toilet stool, a new brush head, a new mop head, nivea moisturiser, furniture perfume spray, the real deal fairy liquid, a face loofah, a can of hummous, and listerine.
I have to submit extra information.
Taxis.

I will walk far to meet you.
At what time?
Okay.
I am okay.
I am 41% percent through a 1000 page long book.
You are hereby requested to complete all sections of the attached form and return it along with all requested supporting documentation, within 21 calendar days from the date of this letter to: Visa Section (EUTR) 5th Floor, Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service 13-14 Burgh Quay Dublin 2 Ireland
We have to.
Please provide evidence that you can financially support the visa applicant when resident in Ireland (attach supporting documentation, for example, bank statement)
Maybe, but me and toka will research it more first.
So I will leave in 45 minutes.
WHERE ARE YOU
Can you call toka and find out where she is?
I am not sure what I want to eat.
The bread roll things.
We will go to Panda because I am bored.
Kareem is not here.
Hi.
Fuck that.
I would say no.
He is an asshole.
Because toka is off on mondays.
I never know what to say about them.
Where did you go.
Well, it depends on the drug.
You can look up the study's on the long term effects of certain drugs.
So I think the solution would be targetting the cause of the bad thoughts.
The current budget is 2500 bills, (3500 us + 2500 lisa) savings, 2000 me, 2000 toka.
I spent 600 today.
Why do you have exams already.
I took things out of the bags and wrote them down.
Youssef is getting breakfast :D
Is the flat super clean?
Oh wow.
Are you going to meet me at panda.
It does not go through nasr city?
OH SURPRISES
Will you send you?
Spanish.
But I have some french and esperanto too.
32 right now.
Which would be her job to find out.
At around 11:20.
Oh then mishmohem
Yes.
Oh I am.
Are you?
Did you figure anything out?
I see a little rice and salad.
Meeting Mania Monday.
Are you busy?
Can you hangout tonight?
I would remove anyone who said that for good with no second chances.
He does not get to argue.
I am home.
Where are you.
I wish I had a reading streak instead.
I bought a stool for the bottom of the toilet finally.
So I will fill that out soon.
Please please meet me today.
I will leave at about 5:30.
I am home.
I think I am missing something.
It is late now anyway.
I think it would help you a lot.
Meaty Mariam Morad Must become Meety Mariam Morad.
When are you home.
I am switching 3 hours from today to wednesday.
But she is not home, I have no idea where she is.
Where did you go?
I mean you go there.
Do you want to make a Flutter app together?
Morning.
Wake up.
I am hunnnnnngry.
Where is mostafa al nahas.
It is the slowest thing ever.
Hmmm, that is a lot of surprises.
Ms Mariam Moraad Moves Mountains.
The rice is very dry but I got a bit out.
Moraaaaaaad.
You were made saad.
How did you parents not drag you out of bed?
When do you need to go?
But I would be sweaty.
Where did the dish come from?
Mariam - Ah! med, sad, Moraaaaaaad. 
I am waiting though.
What why is your mum so young.
Papa sounds like a fruit.
Papa if you were any sweeter you would be papaya.
I love anything you say.
Really? For Narges?
What do you think it is like being a male?
Thin hair, no bulges, no pain.
That makes reading a game.
Who knows, clothes.
But my legs hurt.
Wait while I get to work.
Did you use the spray for the furniture?
There are bicycle stands there so I could cycle there straight from work.
My head hurts. I need some coffee.
Eugh I am so sweaty.
Meeting Mariam Moraad.
The round dish.
I am thirstaaryyy.
Can you be embarrassed because of me?
I am just concerned you feel bad if you swear.
Or Oh no **no** period pain!
You can preserve sperm and use a surrogate, or adopt.
Mariam Morad the Matriarch.
Meeting Me Might Make Mariam Moraad Moon Me.
For the vegetables.
I do not want you to disappear.
Like duolingo.
Oh no, no period pain?
But we have thick hair everywhere.
There are other ways of having children.
I will wait one month and quote you out of context.
I think a lot of how well you rate the sleep is how peacefully you wake up.
Did you go by yourself?
How many books did you read?
How many computers did you use?
I just miss you.
"I am going to work tamaraaaa"
Is Papai a fruit.
I want to make an application that gamifies reading.
It must be close to 2000 days.
Like Duolingo.
I made the idea.
Okay that is enough.
And you thought you only needed one or two.
Did you have corn flakse?
Do not worry if it is too difficult to arrange.
Mmm
I hope they are not shit.
I think those new glasses are broken.
I searched Mariam morad on youtube and found a magnetic slime idea.
I think you should all get your reproductive systems removed.
If my testes hurt me every month, I would very much consider getting them removed.
> But hey how will we have sex.
Mariam Morad Meditates on Mute Mode, Missing Mumbastic Melody.
I am waiting for the call.
I have salad.
Just a giant bowl of salad.
I am still eating salad.

Must Mariam Moraad Mean Millions to Me.
I have no idea how to spell your second name. I never see it. And twitter and instagram have confused me.
OVEN OH
The same one?
Can you get a regular sleep schedule too.
And you look nothing like her.
Yapapa, ay mariamya.
Why are you swearing?
I want a reading app.
No.
You should check out the duolingo app for the general concept.
I have not had special k in forever.
I gave them to you so awkwardly.
I just kept unloading them.
And now I am very sleepy.

Remind me to take android studio home from work tomorrow.
Oh I have cornflakes.
I think it is getting cold.
I am having the salad.
Are you coming for the noodles and fails.
What are you?
She looks too young to have you.
You should use that for his birthday card.
I am just watching crazy childrens songs now.
Oh wow, it is you.
You can delete it.
Just reading books.
How long is our streak now?
Then you would have no downsides.
This kind of fun theme.
And I am lazy.
We can start Friday maybe.
Maybe if it is a smaller box.
Next time you will unload kilogram after kilogram of hummous for me.
What are you doing?
No not yet.
Hmm, I am not sure.
The cat meowed me awake.
How are you?
Come in.
I am home finally.
I am learning so much about ethics.
I want streaks, and points, and trophies.
You do not need a womb or ovaries to have sex.
Did you hear "In the Kitchen"?
Did you sleep?
I finished the salad.
It took me forty minutes to eat.
I felt like I was fat eating peanut butter, but salad.
I was at work at 10 this morning.
I think I am hungry.
Hurry.
You can just have the vulva.
I want points, and streaks, and trophies.
But I do not have android studio downloaded at home currently.
There is no way we could eat it all could we?
It is After Ten yet?
I am here.

Do you even like pineapple juice anymore?
Have you done any paintings recently?

Eugh where is my ali breakfast.
The other people want it.
An appointment with appaulment.
Are you home.
Papaaayaaa.
An adissapaulment then.
Did you see the papaya song?
I am hungry.
There are barking dogs.
How was the appaulment?
Did Hla see it?
When are you home.
Wake up.
Good morning.

Can I have these for your bank account?
I am going to transfer 735gbp to you.
Also, have a good read of that.
Processing of Applications for Visas by Persons applying as Family Members ofEU Citizens exercising or planning to exercise Free Movement Rights underDirective 2004/38/EC
You can see it at home, point 2.4 to 2.6 if my memory is correct.
I just read the entire Directive 2004/38/EC again.
They can not refuse based on any financial basis.
And if they do, it would violate EU law and we would appeal and contact the EC.
I am at toka's parents.
I can not wait to be home.
Where are you?
But it looks and acts like a chat client.
Your name and bank must check the transfer manually when it is sent.
I just woke up.
I had rice and beans and molokhaya, and fool, and ta3meya, and bitingen, and chilli, and basically everything.
When you go to New Chat, it gives you the option in the option menu to add a new contact there.
I have it running in an android emulator.
Think of pineapples.
What are you doing tomorrow.
So we can make a transfer to my account.
I am home.
We have to go to the bank and wait quite a while.
Hi.
Do you want to try delta chat?
mariam@lost.host `moshymariam`
It is very new, and while work is being done on a pc, and ios version, currently only the android version is working.
I am a bit scared to eat breakfast.
What is Aya doing.
Noodles?
Nope.
Wake up.
I did.
Deposited a huge wad of Dosh in toka's bank today.
Oh you speak about me.
I ate so much today I just want to lie and digest.
This is national info.
I mean what did you do today?
And it has an audio button :D
Yeah, I think you gave everything.
You must be awake.
Hi.
I have no idea where I got the water from.
Because emails have no concept of contacts.
The internet became so terrible :(
Or your laptop?
But all messages are just emails, so you can reply with any email client.
But to get end to end encryption, you have to be careful to save your key, and never lose it or you will not be able to read the previous messages.
I was about to ask.
18000.
Did you tell them to find their own different culture person.
You made them jealous.
Which if it works well and fast would be very very nice.
It is not trivial to transfer.
I think just the branch address.
Be home.
We will probably transfer on monday.
The decision will still be some weeks away.
Development of it is really really fast currently.
I guess you are sleeping.
Why was the atmosphere positive.
Good morning.
So to talk to me I should be in your address book. And it uses the photo you have set for me there too.
Did Aya make you sleep.
Oh I know.
I just tried it in go and it is very very cool.
Maybe and noodles.
Shit I put away all my winter clothes.
I am just waiting for the internet and then I will sleep.
I will sleep.
Did you write the cheques?
Oh I never got the invite.
Oh that is a weird response.
IBAN and BIC codes are international.
It is just an email client.
Maybe there is a good email client that is fast.
It was just water for over an hour.
My bum got sore sitting on the toilet.
Once you have fdroid, open it, let it sync, and then search and install `delta chat`
It has a lot of advantages but also disadvantages currently.
My stomach keeps growling.
What did they say.
Come in Mariam.
And I had the worst diarrhoea of all time.
Do you still have fdroid?
Hmmmm.
Hold on.
It was my mistake.
I am not sure.
I have not eaten much all day.
I just drank lots of juice because I lost so much water.
I think you never post on instagram.
I wish it sent higher quality.
Get ready for stomach ache.
You will find them on your account somewhere.
I think I will try this when I get home.
I just realised I do not use android.
Yeah.
I do not think you are here.
But you slept so much.
I was sick in the night.
You can sign into this using any email address.
I set up autoconfig for email logins yesterday for lost.host, so no custom configuration is needed.
I got it.
I had a few dates.
And the messages are all end-to-end encrypted but it would still be better if gmail never knew who I was speaking to.
So do you want mariam@lost.host?
It uses your local address book for contact information.
Can I use it?
I love you.
Leftovers of what?
I have not seen it in months.
My heart is going to explode with anxiety.
I got the receipt from the email.
Not yet.
Why are you up so late.
Is Aya still up.
But now I will be peeing all night.
Mornnning.
Exactly.
Did you shower.
Did no one phone you?
What are the batatas doing?
Okay, how long?
9pm your time.
In 15 minutes now.
Mitchel was the mother's maiden name.
This seems like client to server function calls.
When are you home?
But if he said, lets try again, and you say yes because you never wanted it to end.
Did you eat?
Good morning.
I have a microphone here.
My dad wants to speak to me in thirty minutes.
And my anxiety is at an all time high.
Lisa ended the call.
My appetite is very iffy.
I am finished now though.
Remove these thoughts.
I think I am bored.
What are you?
I just forgot.
I have only washed so far.
I am just waiting.
Hold on.
I need to time the dishes and shower.
The entire way?
It would be a cruel yoyo game he is playing.
News to me.
I can tell it is still iffy, but I am fine.
I feel free.
Eat, drink, change.
It looks like it.
Yes.
Any idea why daddy wants to talk to me?
Voice, he said in thirty minutes.
My dad wants to speak to me.
In gRPC a client application can directly call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it was a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services. As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types
Oh wow.
You have the application open?
You just write the functions you want, and the types, and it generates all the network code for any language you want.
I am writing code.
Goodnight Mariak.
Cycling without the padding is painful.
I am glad to be home.
What are you glad of?
Those sound like strong drugs.
Should I worry?
I hope it is not a relationship that breaks up and goes back together all the time.
I always think if it can break up, it is wrong.
I am home.
I left a voice note.
I know.
How does you mum not pick you up and send you to the appointment?
Oh she is still not back.
I am finished work.
That was one year and 3 months ago.
This is satire.
Yeah but why are they bubbling?
Okay, what is it about?
Is it bad?
No.
I lost my duolingo streak.
He needs to hurry up before anxiety kills me.
I found this record on scottishpeople.gov.uk
Were is your face.
He is coming now, or in general?
June 21st 2017.
Maybe he moved to another place in adersier.
Was he more concerned with scottish water than nanny?
I am not sure.
26th July too.
For me, I would not trust any company that has not been around for five years and has a reputation.
I would also, never expect more than the law requires.

When was his stuff moved out?
I would expect Clive to visit regularly if he did move out.

He talked to you...?
He always kept his room very minimal.
It feels fake.
My grandmother died on the 20th of january and we all just found out.
Dexter's laboratory.
Did you see game of thrones?
Are you still on a call?
Magdy is very tame compared to other bosses I have experienced here.
There is money.
She died on the 20th of january but my family just found out.
If it means anything, I do not want you to leave.
What debt?
What the hell.
When ever my dad wants to speak to me.
The same certificate is under the name Edmonds, Meredith, and Cromack, age 77, nairn.
Nah you do not owe shit.
But if he says there is money, people will want more raises.
If there was no money, the first people to go would be HR.
Keanan and kell.
I was like that.
That actually worked so at least I still have a streak.
15th december 2017.
Everyone running a company of that size and time will be like that.
You should never trust a word that HR and magdy say.
Ow.
A wife for van winkle or something.
Tom & Jerry.
There is that scene with the spaghetti that gets me every time.
I think they would take too long in voice to express.
Yeah.
If I feel bad, I will go home.
I am fine.
Wait, 19.5.
It will be me.
It is the first family member to die within my lifetime.
Rude.
Saved by the bell.
Bayblade.
Mmmmm.
You should not need to pay.
I think she is not down.
When are you home today.
I really wish I had my headset here to listen to music.
Are you still waiting?
And bring food.
To wake up at the same time.
Jimmy nuetron.
My grandmother died :(
The Jinx
Yeah, I know it.
But toka made me watch it, and it is okay.
I am fine.
Do you have an example?
You woke up in the bus?
I am just trying to not think about things.
Then he said the woman next door, 123.
Our electricity bill for the month was 1gbp and the old woman who lives alone next door was 6gbp.
I can not imagine they know either.
Some boy just gave me a carpet.
Hurry and finish the clinic then.
He is buying your labour power and expending it. It is in his interest to get the most out of it and pay the cheapest for it.
Are you home.
The Handmaiden
And I already have today.
I put the clock back on the phone and did duolingo, then went offline forward a day, and did duolingo again.
I could but as long as there is nothing bad at work, it is fine.
She thinks you, mummy, and daddy hate her.
Be home.
You are away in such huge chunks.
You meet so much I get jealous.
Hummous, or special k, or anything not eww.
But I will be overdosing on D in this sun.
Other bad things happened today too.
Wake up.
What makes you think that?
No, we were just never told.
The site depends if she married in Scotland or England
Because I lived indoors with no sun.
It is the server, android, ios, and test go client all in one :D
After a while he told me he sold bananas and oranges in shorouk.
Yeah.
Customer service could not tell you how to get money out of the country and convert it.
Via post.
40 minutes.
Okay.
I somehow suspect you are going to come into a load of privacy laws.
It was your breif responses.
Could they ever contact her?
Is he rich...?
I had cornflakes.
I am very sleepy.
I am very hungry.
I want some really nice bread.
Bank adress 6-8 height streetHerefordHr1 2ae
Your bank branch is in Hereford?
I will check the address.
Magdy is expecting malabak very soon.
It is one of the main things of a bank.
Okay just uploading something.
I am home.
And two avacados.
I remember there was suspicion when nanny broke her wrist.
I am home.
I want super mega noodles.
Hurry.
I was watching somethings with toka.
Oh wow, I would have forgotten.
It has to download so much.
Your bank should convert the money.
When I sent you money, you converted it in the bank.
Magdy just came in.
Amany mentioned it too him, and he is fine with it.
Yeah, it is worth trying.
Kind of just waiting to go home.
Where are you.
The electricity just came and he said 13.5.
How are you getting home?
Jeez, why?
gitlab.com/meutraa/libero
A taxi driver stopped me on the way to work.
They asked me if I remember them.
So I told him, fukroony.
This bank should not exist.
When you go into a bank, you see the conversion rates on a screen.
Wake up faster.
I am going home.
Are you fine?
You can look up marriages for her any one of her previous surnames I think.
And that has many calories.
Not off now.

Hmmm, let me check.
Unplugging the keyboard now.
I do not see how a bank has customers when they do not do currency conversions.
The internet died.
Lisa is worried you are not fine.
The jar owes me 50.
I am not sure, thinking of good times will also be very sad.
What the hell is she doing in there?
I need more energy.
What did you talk about.
I used to take D2 pills.
No.
I am awake.
And when?
Oh wow.
Do you still have access to the playlists?
Yeah, I got debian-9.3.0-amd64-netinst.iso.
And blueberries and raspberries.
The cause of death.
Pretty coincidental.
125g of blueberries.
How did you find that out?
She does not have online banking.
Mmm, I keep telling you to have an alarm.
Ewww.
Oh I love borrtex a lot.
I will sleep now.
It was release a few days ago.
Why did the reception not tell you the correct place?
That is repressive.
It was meant for mummy.
I am going to buy food.
At gourmet eygpt.
Are you coming.
I actually think you should download debian 9.4 at work.
And I did a little but not really.
And then I remembered he was the guy who made me speak arabic when buying the fruits.
What a shitty bank.
Why can they not send it?
Hello.
So both her siblings knew.
I got 3250egp for the servers, which goes into saving.
Oh wow.
I just got home and I will probably sleep soon.
Well, she wanted to be cremated, so that is good.
Oh wow.
I made them all public again.
Height street or High street?
Height street or High street?
To install at home?
It would be bad to show you doing anything but that.
I have 9.3.
But it took absolutely forever to install on my connection.
That is a joke right?
Yeah I just got home and read the messages.
Fainting is scary.
I got two hummouses.
Even the clive part.
Oh wow, it was really clive?
I was sick six times.
I never really slept.
I am here.
The cremation, the certificate.
Oh dear.
I hate proguard.
You saw the photo of him in that newspaper article.
Oh wow.
I will never go to a doctor unless I really think I am dying.
If grandad is living alone, can his pension alone really cover him?
Yeah, the bank does not convert money.
Are you really sure it was him?
I really think he would not risk starting a conversation with daddy.
And so a silence would be a win for him.
But if you want information you can not be accusing.
I am keeping it off my mind.
I am not sure what caused it, maybe fateer yesterday.
I can cope now, but all night was terrible.
I also do not trust any doctor here.
I never went to work.
Ashes? I thought she was buried.
Can I look tomorrow?
Clive looking at property.
They are my favourite fruit.
I think he also knows daddy would be very angry that he was not contacted.
Until about 2pm was terrible.
I could not control it this morning. I ended up actually shitting my pants.
LisaDaddy investigators?
The blueberries cost 115egp for a tiny amount :O
The blueberries are perfect.
R8, big release.
Daddy really has no interest in engaging with him at all.
You could try to contact clive, but I would make sure daddy has nothing to do with it, and does not know.
I was in so much pain, and throwing up all night.
Which makes the bank completely pointless.
R8 is a new tool for code shrinking and obfuscation that replaces ProGuard
I think I have to have a new rule: never eat out again.
I am in so much pain.
I think very likely.
And I do not trust taking new medicine unless I really really have to.
I really need coffee but :S
Even a drip of water hitting my hand hurts.
I am here.
Not going makes her win.
I was really sick yesterday.
What are you talking about?
I just think it is important to study parenthood thoroughly before choosing to do it.
Performance is not always the most important thing.
Otherwise we would start unrolling all our loops.
My skin gets so sensitive when I am sick.
I still really need coffee.
Maybe the apple juice made me sick.
You should try flutter.
You might not like it.
E
I had two bananas.
I suspect everything.
Yeah I have it, but javarx has nothing to do with it.
The rtmp is the url.
If you are using linux, try rtmpdump.
Also does not work.
By yourself?
I want to have coffee to help my head pain, but my poo is already disgusting.
The most illest day of my life was because of a new muscle relaxant.
The mashy arrived.
Are you awake.
But flutter does not use java at all.
These have been in the SDK since the beginning when phones were very low powered.
Yeah, it is only half a year or something I tihnk.
It is the late day at work today.
It hurt to touch things.
You have to go.
What plugin?
I think there are much bigger areas to improve performance in.
enumerators are in almost every language, most languages they are very efficient. Their knowledge applies across many languages.
I have never done any video or audio stuff on android before.
Many enchanments were added.
Well two nights ago.
If you have not run your own benchmarks you should never claim performance issues.
A long time ago.
It worries me that you do.
And audio.
duolingo.com
I was really sick yesterday.
That will not end it.
I think you have been missing recently.
I am going home.
I have had no contact with her since.
I am so hungry.
I would not sacrifice that general knowledge in favor of an SDK specific system.
Search github for an android rmtp library.
Can you send the wooza test url?
Hanging out or hiding out?
I do not think you should talk.
Omar should act as hr here.
I will leave now.
I thought you showed the whole class?
And going to bed is between 12 and 1:30.
I am running a new tool that will hopefully help me resize it easier.
Oh that might work.
A little hungry, but waiting for hummous.
I will leave in 15 minutes.
So call me maybous.
Also, we can not forget to get more bread on the way home from breakfast tomorrow.
Is it because the mobile network?
I can hangout.
** windows
Oh.
A little yes, but it is the weekend so it does not matter when I sleep.
Maybe the apple was not fresh.
Yeah, I am not a fan of groups.
I did last year.
Sometimes I write java when I know I am working with someone who does not know kotlin.
I know, I have it...
Radio streams usually use a different protocol I think.
There is nothing wrong with the link if it works in vlc.
Sorry, rmtpdump
I tried rtmpt.
Flash died many many years ago.
It is the new framework on android, right?
I think there is a thin line of enough Mariam, and nowhere near enough Mariam.
Are you trying to provoke her?
I still like enums better.
You are going to start a fight, and I do not think during your period is the time to do that.
I only really use kotlin these days.
And the tool support for enums is much better.
It is also language level rather than sdk level.
And unless you are calling an enum a few hundred thousand times a second, using an enum is not a performance issue.
If the library is popular, and you can not find your issue in the github issues, either the stream is authenticated somehow (no idea), or you must be using the extension wrong.
Kind of looks like it.
I do not have flash player.
6 times during the night.
I got no sleep and was off work yesterday.
I am fine.
I am waiting for hummous.
I am home; I am hummous.
You need a rmtp client.
I just wish there was a library as good as glide for videos.
I do not know the quality of the Arabic -> English course though.
Just what I pick up day to day.
Where are you.
Not yet.
Are you home yet.
I am hunnnnnngry.
Reactive programming takes it's roots from functional programming, which never beats the performance of imperative.
Yeah, rtmp.
Try the link in another rmtp client.
Could you find another rtmp link from a different site to test?
Yeah, I feel fine now.
Why are you not going?
-?
Things like when toka gets home is -15 + 60 minutes on the accuracy.
I thought maybe it is not obvious to you my timing.
My hdd was connected to my monitor, and when I turned my monitor off last night, it stopped.
It is 65% done.
I am mostly okay now.
Probably.
Yeah, it is a long day today too.
Oh wow I have not drank all day.
Call me tonight.
Are you home yet?
I remember many years ago I got very sad that nanny was gone.
I am home.
No I will wait.
Eww.
Could you write a short declaration stating you would assist our living costs until we are working, sign it, and scan it?
These large hdd operations take forever.
I will get debian installed for you too then.
I am having kurumb mashy.
How are you?
I had not seen her in so long it was like she was gone.
Guess. What@ Day! It? Is#
Having a bit of a problem.
Also ext4, but I know there is a windows driver for that.
Any time in the free time you can take.
Where is that?
I can leave windows on it to dual boot.
Hello.
If a toilet seat is unclean, the plastic is thin an now dirty one side, and it slips and slide.
By gone, I do not mean dead.
Not yet but I suspect in the future I will.
It was tomorrow?
But usually what I put.
Because I am so familiar with it maybe I just assume.
Oh wow.
The first attempt did not work.
I am not sure yet.
But it was just novel.
What did you get rid of?
Hi.
I am fine.
I am having coffee.
Updating? Is it not better to just add?
I already have the latest statement.
Ray was the only person nanny's side that was told.
Is it obvious why Thursday is the worst day now?
I am okay.
My stomach is a bit noisy.
I find sitting on plastic even more disgusting.
When will you ever send you.
Come in.
I will have a little hummous and then wait for mashy.
Yeah.
No I will shower and shave my armpits.
25% now.
browering?
I did at some point.
Are you living with her now?
Toka abdelkader
Have you seen how shit the us kitchen nightmares is compared to the british?
What did Aya feed you?
You are meant to say fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.
How can I?
Okay it may take a while to move this data to the beginning of the drive to shrink the partition.
I made you a calendar.
The cycling is actually 15 before and after work, but the calendar only does chunks of 30 minutes.
45%
Breakfasts :D
I thought you would go tomorrow.
Also, use the application number 25595852
I should really sleep.
I will get the phone and be back.
Hello.
What do I do.
Oh wow, I have 900GiB not allocated in the lvm, it is fine.
The move is at 4.5%, I have managed to crack the software, and loaded the previous session we did.
Wake up.
Ah.
I am having a hard time resizing this.
You kept foosty food in your bedroom?
"The visa officer concerned"
Are Ray and Sharon doing okay health wise?
**There's more!**
You look like you have become one with the sheet.
Second scan and recovery in the morning.
Do not worry Narges.
I usually drink a lot at a time.
If you still believe it is plausible and more likely the cause of symptoms than other things, and you want to check instead of just supplementing.
If you were finished I would be scared that you could move away or get a new job and meet new people and drift away.
But when?
My hdd is LVM which is not supported on linux.
Just to keep you up to date.
Okay hummous.
Make sure my name, and toka's name are fitted in too.
I think I want hummous before I sleep.
I just do not like thin plastic touching me.
**That's right! Two whole Mariams!**
Vitamin D is important for women though and I would recommend taking it no matter what.
It is among the top things I hate.
No idea.
I am trying for today though.
A babywipe to clean the seat sure.
Then Debian.
You can pretend you are I'll it is fiiiine.
I just highly doubt a vitamin D deficiency in anyone in Egypt who leaves the house a couple of times a year.
I hate the feeling of having to study.
Okay now I will sleep.
Wake up.
My poop is disgusting.
My stomach is very very loud.
I am a bit scared.
Okay.
Are you fine. Where are you. How is everything. Are you happy.
Yalla go get chamomile.
You are the bed.
Also be here tomorrow it is my free free day.
What.
Do not think about it.
Okay I will go down first.
Oh.
Or no.
The first partition is being recovered while I sleep.
Otherwise you may as well be taken any random check.
If not you would have a perfect diet.
Just be healthy.
I at least know that you are in a course and things probably will not change.
Yeah.
That file is not there.
I look like a <del>death</del> angel.
Yes but you are free to three.
How expensive.
How many vitamin D pills can you get for 1000?
It helps the assimilation rate of calcium. Which stops being assimilated after 35 or so.
So unless you want to get a hunchback as an old woman.
It is 3.
What if you fall in love and for some reason they do not want you to talk to me.
I woke up.
Where are you.
**Order now, and received one extra Mariam!**
There is nothing wrong with your face.
They make you take forks and look after hla.
Free to three for five.
I do not know about on a mobile.
But it should be there on the pc.
I have three tubs of them here.
I am sure if you get tested for all nutrients you will be below on many of them.
<3
Have none or good, but certainly not bad dreams Mariak.
Oh do not forget to get some.
No, it will be sent soon.
How can you relax without sleeping.
I will never sleep.
No I just did the last one.
Check to see if there is even reason to suspect a deficiency.
I am scared of the new people you meet because you might find a partner and you might drift away.
You might grow to like that person more though.
She got it.
You can look into it first.
Also people average 9 I think deficiencies in the UK.
Which is why our food is all suplimented.
I think you should do some study on vitamin D before blindly trusting someone.
Hi.
I made a new server and move riot to it.
But it was very troublesome.
It is fine now though.
Be here.
Oh phew you are here.
I will get in bed.
Will we talk?
Okay one moment.
Hello.
Oh why?
I just do Spanish now.
Does riot feel faster to confirm and send messages?
Or duolingo@lost.host
The sun is coming up.
Wake up soon.
Will you compete with my unbroken 167 day streak?
I kicked everyone out of my club.
I am dehydrated.
I had 3.5L today.
How do you feel?
I think you fell.
Meutraa I think.
I already have you.
FSAXKH
Wake up.
You can join my club with this code
I peed too much.
What is it going to?
They stopped interacting.
Goodnight Mariak.
test
What, why.
Too much French learning?
I only slept five hours.
Has it got any better?
I mean over the months.
Confused about what?
You will get dehydrated crying so much.
Do you not get exhausted and sleepy when this sad?
Wake up and let us meet today.
611 kittens.
I went to work.
HR is an idiot and made up the pay rise.
I am trying to get a contract.
Trying to switch to hourly pay.
50 would be around a 17% rise.
I also made a quick program to tell HR how many working days and hours are in a month.
Or did you mega shower?
I need to glue the headphones again.
What do you have?
Did everyone like your twitter avatar?
I need more juice.
I could not drink coffee at work today because I was too anxious.
I had no reason to be, which is why I did not want coffee.
You are a banana.
I fixed it.
But it could take up to an hour to take affect.
Did you sleep?
And add the ear things to the shopping list.
I am glad I am home.
For the first time in about three months I hit the end of my list of work tasks.
I am getting sleepy.
Are you crazy?
He lives in the green buildings.
Of 42.46egp an hour.
42.46 is my current rate.
Because every month I have to count on a calendar.
Did you guys get the domain and billing?
I do that for work and home.
Sometimes.
I am home.
For the first time in about three months I got to the end of my list of work tasks to do.
I feel like there is nothing I can do to stop the sadness.
But my head also really hurts.
But it might take up to an hour to apply.
Ah.
Magdy lives basically where the agencies were.
Did she comfort you at all?
I have brown bread.
But you were crying all last night and I was not there, and I could not stop it.
The water must be freezing.
I also made a quick program to tell HR how many working days and hours are in a month.
I have like 1300 hours total.
Did you tell her you need more iron.
Fewsh.
I can not stop making amazing jokes in my head when I see his name.
And when I hear Aya, I keep practicing karate in my head.
It makes me feel terrible.
Come back.
I am really really hungry.
Here is an example of a crowdfunding website that was done with wordpress this year at magdsoft.
Could you get the kellogs ones?
I was thinking of asking one minute ago.
What did you do outside?
I should really try to sleep more tonight.
Come in.
At least in this code I am looking at.
Oh.
I am slowly switching the server to a different server.
Riot was all finished yesterday.
And the sunglasses are so people do not recognise you.
Cars have sun shades to pull down, and the windows are tinted at the top.
I am home
I will go to bed.
Is an object.
When I come to work, I can say, misa misa yalla benequl.
The ear pads keep seperating.
My stomach is grumpy.
I have moved most of lost.host to the new server.
I picked the worst day not to take my headphones.
I have 40 more minutes.
Do you never have nice dreams.
I am falling.
I am awake.
I am going to a work thing bas.
Also an object.
Good morning, come on let us yet.
Work without music is much harder.
What will you do today.
That is weird, our cats are fine after the groomer.
Hold on.
Ah much better.
Will you send the original photo?
If you have trouble seeing far away, how can you wear sunglasses while driving?
PHP:
I will have breakfast.
I could not take my headphones today because they needed gluing again to fix them.
I have had them for about 6 years now I think.
I just have some mail stuff to do.
No idea, I am in AC.
Yeah.
I want the groomer to shave the head, and tail too. But they say it looks too weird.
Sendensednsens.
There are ~~builders~~ assholes with hammers and I am getting stressed.
Oh I was hoping for it to move.
You look so bright.
But also like you just escaped from prison.
So where is that photo?!
What are you doing at the office?
They such a shitty syntax and lack of type understanding.
Yeah, I never say it.
I say, "Morning"
They actually need to go, the hair is too long.
It should be fixed now.
Where are you.
I am making coffee.
I will head home now.
Thinks will be drear until I get some at work.
I remember when it was released.
Unit tests are pretty easy.
Our testers should write automated tests, not do manual tests.
It wastes half our time doing manual tests.
Otherwise, that time could produce more value by developing.
It is only when the value lost by problems that could be solved with unit testing becomes higher than the value added by writing tests.
Produce at lowest value possible, sell at socially necessary value.
I am waiting to go home.
Where did you go?
Are you here.
Wake up.
Agera was developed by the google music team.
No idea about android tests though.
Testers should do that, jeez.
Unit testing makes more sense for code that does not change much, and the whole project takes a lot of time.
Does the fragment have a name attribute?
Does it have the id map?
The android manifest uses :name for the class, and the fragment class uses class:
A summer class for what?
Not yet.
Be here.
I would only use unit tests on peices of code that are prone to errors.
Like any code with incremental variables and formatting.
And overall you want the value to be as low as possible, to sell at the same price.
This is not enough code.
Also in onstart
I am not sure if `.notify(this)` causes the activity to call the Location callbacks.
Here is the configuration I use.
It does not have a android:name
To say which class it is.
Nope.
Rx is better though.
I have not had coffee or breakfast yet :(
Soon.
Send the builder of LocationManager, and any use of it.
Oh LocationBaseActivity.
It will ignore any change < 10m, any measurement less accurate than 25m at 83% configuration, and only send at minmum 1s intervals.
I have not had coffee yet.
I think you mean "as well", not "else.
I notice this a lot.
Ewwww
Call getLocationManager().get(
And also, the defaultConfiguration is too bad.
Fragment name.
Did you remember to call get() ?
defaultConfiguration is shit.
Show me that class.
Okay so it looks like currentLocation is always null, to activate the LocationManager you must call getLocation() in onCreate() of your UserSetupMapActivity.
Pay attention to the values in the last Builder.
Actually, just paste the xml for the fragment.
Add this.
Great design.
That is too much.
Where is it?
Everything is just a way to get money off you.
But also, make sure google maps is enabled in the api console, and the api key is correct.
Installed it from what?
Why are they not paying the rent?
Is the name attribute a SupportMapFragment?
Consequently, this is one of the reasons fragments must have public zero parameter constructors.
Framework.
I just made coffee.
For two weeks I have not been sleeping enough.
Make it a var and GoogleMap?
So it tricks you.
Usually this means the final release is tested and works, then upload and none of the google apis work.
Ah.
A month holiday is too much.
But the cat wakes me up in the morning, on purpose.
She sniffs my face and stands on me.
And I am just going to bed late because I want more time.
Hi I am home. And I suppose I am happy.
Then the fragment manager manages them and their argument bundles.
Come in.
Okay.
Why not french, or a hobby.
If the course requires more studying, it should contain more studying, or be easier.
I am so tired.
lateinit property mMap has not been initialized
And if you are using the google services gradle plugin, a google-services.json with the correct data.
Is 7 hours and 9 hours your real agreement, and is it inclusive or exclusive of the hour break?
The play store ignores your signing keys these days, and replaces them with a single uploaded signing key.
Yes, a bit.
But I took the other earphones.
I have juice and showered.
Hi **Mariam**.
lateinit means you know for certain that by the time it will be used it will never be null.
But you can never know for certain that a GoogleMap is nonnull, because not all phones have google mobile services, and the api key could fail.
Also, make sure you have the manifest meta-data for the google api key.
I do not like the google services gradle plugin though.
The hours should start 10 minutes before the start of a class at least.
Hmmm, I think now.
Why?
Oh, wow, I never even knew it was on the play store.
Do you have a rental there?
Jeez.
What are you doing today?
And use ?. calls.
Check logcat "no specific application"  and filter for key.
not
The signing keys you use are called upload keys to them.
I hate tourist everything.
And tours.
There is what?
Yeah, I managed to not fall but I hit my ankle hard.
Are you super
A Killers reference.
Will there be 100 calls, and 100 photos, and 100 videos?
I think I will go to the shop to get bread.
Aya looks so happy and you look a bit weirded out like you just saw someone looking at you from inside the lens.
When will they stay until?
It has not rained here since spring.
Especially tourists.
Every night.
Oh, I thought you meant too much noise at that time, at work.
I never wake up because of noise any more.
Wait, am I 27?
# DANCER
I will be back in five minutes.
This is a nice photo.
You only go four days which is why you only get paid 4/5ths.
Where are you.
Okay.
We need a bath mat; I slipped.
# FINE
Is this all the people I hear about apart from Mazen.
Are you not melting in that coat?
Is it not too late?
I am bread.
Are you untired yet?
No.
Jeez arse head.
I do.
The fan creates a constant, unpatterned noise, and my earplugs block the rest.
Or are you
With Aya's family?
Will you send you now?
I really want toast.
I have bread.
Are you home.
No, just yalla.
No that is my age.
I have done four things in go already, but this is the first time with approval before hand.
If I were 27 though...
I got # Bread&# Noodles
Do they live near?
Why are you home so late.
It looks like a rocket lorry.
I saw some of these on the way to walkers once.
Good morning.
Of course, I am missing one adult tooth :(
Let me count my teeth.
You should save the latest received location update.
And use that when you need to jump to the current location.
Are you fine?
You can use onlongclick.
Hi.
I am chess falling.
Oh yeah, it hurts like hell after the anaesthetic wears off.
Moving a marker is very inneficient.
I am.
I got madgy's approval to write a socket in Golang for the first time :D
I am not wise enough.
It will lag if you move it every frame.
Then when the map stops moving, switch the visibilities.
I do not have any wisdom teeth, I lucked out.
And they are not on the x-rays.
Yeah, none.
The current place...?
The way I did it was, when the map starts to move, hide the marker, and show a centered imageview that looks the same.
I think I eat 70% of my calories at work.
Teeth do not grow, you are born with them.
I have not used uber.
onmarkerlongclick or whatever it is called.
Pffft that is nothing.
Hi.
I am going home now.
You should correct your display name to Amr.
I am so sweaty it is bad for the environment.
I am hoooooooooome.
And go home.
Jeez about time.
I have been complaining about the measure text performance for 6-7 years.
Okay.
I will have to buy all that bling next month then.
Crazy is licking my toe.
His tongue is like sandpaper.
He must think it needs cleaning.
Ah yeah they created a new client about 4 months ago.
Have not had the chance to check it out yet though.
It is impossible for me to say from just this.
A senior guides and has lasting effects on juniors.
If you see people looking up to you, and you feel like you are changing others, then you are probably acting as a senior.
More than anyone else.
Maybe when I am 40.
Well, you know where I am.
Life is easy as it is.
We are moving in December though.
No, nearer.
It is just a bit far from work.
At least on the weekdays.
But I am okay and it is the weekend.
He was too ugly, sa7?
You used to be able to edit, I swear.
I always hated the name of this band.
Will you sing it?
I have about 3L on a day where I am at home all day.
The experience and knowledge helps, but it is a social relation.
Give it time to see if you fall into the position were everyone starts respecting and trusting you.
But tagama would be the backup.
I am so tired.
I have been sleeping too late for 3 weeks now.
And your play hours :D
Hi.
Jesus.
Or he considers drinking a tonne of alcohol bad.
When will you leave?
Did you see your therapist?
Yeah I am super hungry.
Do you talk about the same things?
My impression is that he just fucked off without regard.
Wai.
What.
I quite do.
The summer I guess.
In the summer.
I need to eat, and drink, and sleep, and wash.
You have to be strict about your working hours or you just wear out.
Are you as smooth as butter now?
Or sleeping with someone.
I still can not belive Aya did not invite me.
Did you talk to me and then die of embarrasment?
minutes
70 mints would give me severe stomach ache.
Wait, you have a jaccuzi?
Who has a jacuuzi outside of the sims?
I will eat bread.
I had four slices of bread.
Wow.
1L in this heat seems impossible.
And coffee.
But I think it has to do with how this protocol is federated.
Not through me correcting them all the time.
And every one makes more effort to speak English than I make to speak Arabic, so I would just be an asshole to critisise.
Then you will know you are the senior :D
I still consider myself a beginner.
To a much more expensive place.
But it is nearer work, and there are no cafes, there are gardens, and it is clean, and silent.
I am tired, and hungry, and thirsty, and tired.
Are you her therapist now.
Unless you are eating food with lots of water in it.
That is colder than the night time temperature here.
I like juice too much.
After you spend some time around non-native speakers I think you get used to the flexability of the language.
I believe people will learn by themselves through daily practice.
They seem to think things must be perfect or not at all.
I think I eat 70% of my calories at magdsoft.
But I miss you and I am tired.
Bad things in Glasgow is knife crime or drugs.
Well I hope he did not stab someone.
You were gone a long time.
Oh are you going up North tomorrow?
Will you be here the whole time?
You are meant to be the happy one.
I just have sliced bread and pickled onions.
I do not try on clothes though, I just put them on and go.
I usually drink so much I have no room for food.
And 5L on a work day.
Are you sure it is only 1L.
Maybe you should measure for a few days.
Robinson's.
The Egyptian woman who asked the English speaking actor how his first oscar was.
It is not some type of law to obey.
Which is just nonsense.
Yeah, we have moved on from that, thankfully.
South.
I will get into bed very soon.
No.
Because it is slow, and if you can precompute the image, do that.
Yeah non-natives themselves feel very different about it.
As long as it is not a hinderence to expression, it is fine.
It is serving it's use as a communication tool.
The reporter at the oscars highlighted this issue to me.
The point of language is to comminicate thoughts, if it does that, it is fine.
What the hell is this bottle?
Everyone is taught French, and most people leave school forgetting it all.
It is imfamously terrible though.
It is meant to be Scottish.
A club with a pool.
Yes.
The computer could get wet.
Now I am.
But only when it is dynamic.
The minimum recommended version is now 21.
Oh do all your friends have drivers.
I am eating slices.
There is also a weird thinking that if you speak English you are more educated and better than others.
There was a time in the UK were the rich and educated spoke French.
The Normans conquered the island around 1300 I think.
The electricity.
It has been off for half an hour.
On the nile.
Nile county club.
That sound dangerous.
The Mariam has been out for 40 minutes.
My head really hurts.
Who is driving?
And wondering WHERE THE FUCK IS THE WEDNESDAY VIDEO
I think the attitude people took about her is a good symbol for how Egyptians think about speaking English.
It would be insane for me to think that the better you speak French in the UK, the better you are educated.
No.
The power has been off for twenty minutes.
Famous for some bad reason.
There is no power :(
Hi.
It came back.
I have fallen.
Good night Mariak.
I am awake.
I used a Glide BlurTransformation.
Which fuck yes no more vector issues.
But I am scared to go to it.
Does mona not feel left out?
Because of this?
Cairo country club.
I do not like clubs.
I like computers.
Come in.
Are you there yet?
Oh.
It is one command in photoshop.
It is over a second.
Anyway, just make it and blame the designers when it look awful.
Maybe have a hidden imageview for the whole screen, and when the popup button is clicked, capture the background, hide it all, show the image view, add the blur effect to the capture into the imageview.
Yeah good luck with sockets and persistant map state :D
I am off to toka's parent's.
My head hurts, but I am having coffee.
Are you fine?
You should get them in photoshop to apply blur to a 2560x1600 image and time how long it takes.
It is easy to do in photoshop, and does not happen in mobile design.
Glide.with(this).load(R.drawable.demo).apply(bitmapTransform(new BlurTransformation(25, 3))).into((ImageView) findViewById(R.id.image));
It really should be into an imageview too.
Is it you and mona and her neighbours?
Were will you stay?
Or because of something else?
Do you want to block him.
Even then it might be faster to compute it when they choose the image and save it to cache.
jeez.
On top of a map too.
Which is unacceptable performance for a popup.
You will have convert the content view to a bitmap, then blur it.
Also, test it on a real device.
But not this month because toka is home on fridays.
I never heard about it.
That is what happened with me and ben.
He switched to geophysics.
Yeah, but if it is static, just blur it in gimp and use the blurred image.
Only do it if it is like a dynamic user background they can change.
Oh.
Everything must be done in 1/60th of a second to not be laggy.
Or I think there is a capture screen api, but it was deprecated.
The issue here is it is not cached.
Nope.
Never on a thursday.
Sometimes on a friday.
No.
Does aya own a yaught?
Yes, but it uses api quota.
Well, activate billing.
The free limit increase.
You can try it, but I think this is a case of shitty design.
Well it is their fault when they get ransomwear and spyware.
It is parents time.
I am there. Are you there.
I am here.
Or pretended to.
Did you have Special K for breakfast?
Will we hangout?
Where did you go.
So be careful.
Hi.
Did you try to stand on Mona's shoulders?
This is Egypt.
Oh no, did you sleep.
Ali for breakfast NAE DOOT
See if you can get something stronger.
Also it is a painkiller not a fill all symptomns medicine.
What are you doing. What do you see.
I needed anti histazine for three days.
I just got it.
But it seems unimaginable.
Oh yes, Aya.
Or will Aya feel ignored?
This is the niciest way I can come up with getting values from the fragment arguements.
Noodles?
Jeez you need that NUC.
The router keeps connecting, having about 50CRC errors a second, and dropping the connection about 8 seconds later.
It started happening at exactly midnight, I expect they are fucking around.
Paracetamol is pretty weak.
I always wonder what it would be like to sleep next to you.
No I think it would be wonderful.
A hug that does not have to end.
Did you go to the beach?
But this is Aya we are talking about.
Will you send you?
We only do voice chat.
Then yalla to the hangout machine.
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING IT
You took the pc home to work at home?
They just assume you are asleep and can work on the network.
Ibu profen is an anti imflamatory
Decide in the morning.
It was too loud at her parents and I was so tired so I just put my earplugs in and slept the whole time.
Well, the monitor can be used for playing games too.
I used to get issues at exactly 2am with BT in the uk.
It does not cure things.
Yeah, just keep taking the paracetamol and cope.
I doubt it will help with anything you have.
Only one root was remaining in it.
It did hurt a lot.
I disabled ADSL2 and 2+ from the router and it connected using ADSL1 and it is working perfectly.
Do you have medicine for the pain?
But it was without anaesthetic.
A baby tooth at about 18 years old I think.
But the morning all the drugs have worn off.
Good morning.
This has become one of my favourites.
I am having coffee.
A big digital piano, yes.
Like my one at home.
It costs 4000-5000egp to ship it here.
What model is my piano?
I think there is a library to do this line type thing.
I am very sad.
You should probably get checked for the fever and sickness. It could be because of an infection caused by the surgery.
It is true.
So keep that in mind.
Then pulled it out.
I want a piano this year.
Is the bed and the temperature comfortable enough for that long?
I did have one tooth out.
They pushed and crunched a hole in the middle.
I used to think this song was about P&O ferries.
What did you do today?
I think it will not be tonight.
Yes.
I made coffee.
Wake up.
Wake up.
How are your kittens?
What is?
So I will look for a second hand one here.
Oh you slept for a very very long time.
I'm
Something you ate?
You have on guess, and it is correct.
I was excited to yesterday.
That is all I remember.
What did you have?
Oh I had some chips.
Cut potatoes and fried.
Worried in general or now.
When will you stay up to?
Did you have a nice day?
I hope you are taking 1000 photos.
I never like the look of them.
I do not like rye bread, not even for a minute.
one
Yes.
I slept for another 5 hours.
Okay this is good.
Come back.
I am super hungry.
Oh I want cornflakes.
I miss cereal 2-3 times a day :(
You told them the Celtic Loop and they misheard.
Hi Mariam.
I mean I hate it, but I suppose so.
But I am sad.
I had breakfast from Ali, and two chocolate halawa sandwiches.
I did not do much today though.
**Bows to applause**
Oh no.
Oh, tatoos are one of the things I really do not like.
I am.
I have been for half an hour.
Yes.
A bit iffy.
The place we stayed.
1 month is the cheapest period.
No.
Yesterday was parent's day.
How long can you?
Which things?
If toka goes to bed and sleeps, I want to hangout.
It is.
If you take a picture of a potato, do you get a photato?
I do like Mariam, even for a minute.
<3
What about Chocolate K?
I am mega falling.
Wake up.
I am at work.
I do not know anything yet.
Come to Cairo.
November is going to be jumper weather.
They have no radiators or heating.
Okay.
I used to eat so much special flakes and hummous.
Or I will go to Syria.
I will.
Are you still outside?
It was like 6-10 dollars a night I think.
No heating, or insulation.
It is too far away to worry about it now.
Go to the north coast.
We can talk more about it later.
I am not sure anymore, it needs research.
I am at work.
Will you send you?
Is this right now?
I will have hummous for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and toothpaste.
I got into bed.
I love you.
Goodnight Mariak.
Yeah, I just just arrived.
Hi.
Is today your last day?
Is Lisa even coming?
What?
If you want decent price and really nice, "Irena's cozy inn".
You just get a bus from the road next to it to El gouna.
Hurghada is a proper city.
Yeah no.
You will need hot water bottles.
Just you wait.
20 outside means 20 inside.
Too soon, and too late are more expensive.
And you stay on this island of Nubians.
<3
Are you fine?
Irena's cozy inn was super cheap.
You said novemember.
Cario and el gouna are Arabian.
Okay I did my work.
I am hangout available.
I am hoooome.
Salary tomorrow.
I am giving him some slack since he mentioned his trouble at home.
Is this koshary-induced-period?
If you know what I am saying.
Wait, did the library not work out?
This line thing is alright.
I am glad you are there until Thursday.
They are all headers.
A key map is not as good.
Where we went together.
I liked there better than el gouna.
Or.
We know this guy in Aswan.
It was the best place.
He is a 65-70 year old Nubian.
He is very nice.
But Aswan is Nubian.
Jeez about time.
Yeah, I have a task to finish before I can leave.
Yeah do it.
I finished the go socket :D
Is is curious about what the code looks like.
Crazy only makes pigeon noises.
I had koshary again.
I am super hungry.
Oh you left.
His name is Sali.
It is at the south of egypt.
Not yet.
I am here.
I am home.
When it works first time, in the more complicated scenarios, he has to be impressed.
Oh is it muffin time.
I guess because today is a weekend.
Anseweresyre
Yeah, do a recyclerview then.
I would just make 4/5 different types.
Expandable?
If it expands to a different layout, fine.
I have a lot of work right now.
Come in.
I am hmm, what am I?
I took a cooldown shower as soon as I got back.
I just got wet in of the shower.
One was very enough.
HR, that is.
Are you coming home.
Oh yeah.
What is it?
What were you doing looking in the camping stuff?
They are what?
And expandable is ish, it depends if it expands to more items.
@Param username: String
But query parameters are more common I think.
This username is called a query field.
And the paul is called a query value.
You can add @Header("content_id") contentId: String
Gson is type safe.
Not having type safety kills time in the long run.
Look at the garden.
I will head home.
The salad is not long enough.
I discharged too.
Me too, my mum and dad.
No matter how long it takes you to do this, make sure to tell them never to give you that design again.
I think this notation.
If you want dynamic headers.
How are you?
And if you will not fall asleep there.
I will have some hummous ta3meya now.
This looks like my cycling trousers.
Okay it is home time.
I have vitamin d3 in tubs.
Is this her trying to breach the grass?
It has to be.
Hahaha good luck.
If it expands to more items, fuck off.
The part after endPoint?
It is not type safe.
Any language can do that, it is the most naive way of doing it.
Hi.
Oh no that is way too fncy.
I need lots of juice.
This is enough sun for my white skin.
Yeah they did.
@Body will use the converter factory.
You can have a body with a get request too.
There are no queries here.
It makes bugs, and hard to find ones.
Will we hangout again tonight?
Just yes.
Oh that explains it.
I am home.
But I do not need it in Egypt.
I had it in Scotland because there is no sun.
Hi.
I did.
They are not back with breakfast yet.
Magdy just gave me another socket to do in Go :D
I had my second coffee and I feel all right.
Why are you not in the garden.
You are not home home, though, right?
The second guy looks like the same face giving guy.
Wake up.
Okay, Magdy just asked for another socket in go :D
For example.
The ide is smart enough to know that the last line will never run.
Did you practice singing that song?
Go :D
Hi here.
If your phone is waterproof.
Also, there must be a ladder to exit or you might die.
I am back.
Darker skin absorbs less.
After my juice.
calaclacalll
Rent man came.
Where are you.
Are you here.
I am sooo hungry.
If you return unconditionally, or conditionally, but always.
And then after that code, have code.
Okay.
Bzzzz bzzzz
He said he will sign two next month.
Are you hungry.
I am getting sleepy.
Megayes.
Okay it is music time.
And I think knowing assembly teaches you lessons about performance, and abstractions.
A good understanding of pointers is needed. But java just hides this from you, and then people do not understand when things are pointers or not and the consequences.
They were talking about how the php services had 100-400ms response times.
But he is learning that I can make great webservices with it.
It really helps.
It is a pain to use, but it teaches the importance and origin of many things.
Oh.
I always mix up this name.
I am home.
What why.
I fancy white bread and chocolate spread.
Work is enough for a day.
But C.
I think all people should learn C.
Yeah.
To what?
Well he does not want go code because people who can use go are not common or cheap.
You should learn some other languages.
It requires you to be more careful, and to understand what you are doing more.
The concept is Pull to refresh.
No.
Oh now Eslam and Magdy were talking about the performance of it responding in 10ms instead of 400ms and he wants the web developers to learn it.
Okay now he is talking like he want the whole web team to switch to go.
And the go ones are all less than 10ms.
What does it look like?
You better not thank me with less hash.
In the house?
I am home home.
City stars should be thursday.
One thing a day to keep the exhaustion away.
Swap?
The name is SwipeRefreshLayout.
Packing up now.
Where are you.
Hmmmm.
And a map of booleans called isParentExpanded
For later, but also white bread and spread.
For parentId -> isExpanded
Our cats do not snort the ant powder.
The function is missing the @Binding notation.
Why is the door not sealed?
But why would they when they could just not sqeeze through tiny spaces?
It is a breathing hole.
The heat.
I have no idea what you mean.
Just stick slug pellets everywhere.
I would have every time have a parentId field.
Why are they eating them?
This hole is tiny.
Slugposter more like.
If you break, or leave before her, she wins.
Savage.
Also the function has to be called getGoingVisibility
Is mummy letting them in?
Okay so what is the hole in the side of its head?
Wake up.
You should delay those actions until after your period.
There is no way Omar wants to be in the middle of you two though.
It is stopping all comunnication expect necessary for work to occur.
Were you not meant to be on the feed?
Then a function setExpanded(parentId)
Which then loops through every item in the list, and sets isVisible in the item to true or false depending on wether that parentId is being set to true or false.
And then notifies each position a change happens.
Yeah cat life repellant.
This code is pointless.
Hi.
It looks hot.
Trying to escape the house.
Eugh my head hurts.
If she says something you like/dislike, do not communicate that to her.
Did you ask why?
Pretty sure they can not smell that far.
If slugs can get in, heat can get out in the winter.
Set up a camera to see where they are getting in.
It might not be the door.
Why are you almost crying?
How are you now?
I think half of the reasons are going to apply to working in the same building as her.
You should reduce your communications with her to the bare needed.
This is not starting anything. It is stopping things.
except
What are you?
Did you sugarbunit?
Oh no I am out of juice.
> Not here
No.
I am waiting for hummous ta3meya.
I have another task but it is too big to start just before the weekend.
Give her the silent treatment.
When you come in the morning, do not smile at her. Just say hello.
What is up with your mum?
What is up with us?
This is a good question.
Whose birthday was it?
Magdy gave me another task to do in Go after this one.
Three of the nice green apples.
Some tomatoes.
eccept
Reduce your emotional responses to her too.
But did you ask her why?
Then this should be the reason you believe.
Where were you?
I am home.
Are you coming now?
Well if you do not like them and you get mad at the person who gave them to you, they might say to you, "you better nacho language!"
Mariam.
I am here.
Wake up.
I GO TO THE TAP MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY
Yeah.
Good.
My head hurts a little; it is coffee time.
It is coffeeeeee time.
Fun brings out the worst in people.
Three in one week.
Okay I finished the second go service.
It is hoooooome time.
Hey, I am a he.
I think you are happier there.
Hmm.
Not enough coffee.
I had some when I got here, but I am running on half tank.
The website server stopped booting 30 minutes before my weekend.
Marrrrriaaamm.
Hmm, juice and coffee.
And I shall answer it by returning the same question to you.
I hope you are super fine.
Everyone is playing games.
I am hooome.
Is it colourful?
I have chocolate halawa and bread.
Oh coffee.
Wawawawawake up.
Go socket count is at 6 now :D
I am waiting for hummous ta3meya to arrive.
I am finished my work for now.
The problem was crazy.
Oh.
No, but I need to download that tonight.
WATER ON TAP YEAAAH BOOOOIIII
Hi.
Wow, rude.
That she thinks is better.
Maybe they are studying behind your back.
Well, not my nose, recently I started pulling all those out.
Oh no.
I slept early the last few days.
Come in.
Let us spend this 11% like it were our last.
Are you looking browner.
And I am juuust leaving now.
I have only seen what you have shown me.
My sister told me about a series very similar to Making a Murderer.
Are you home?
There is a might, so do not.
I will get into bed, if you want to talk.
Oh phew.
Are you a pedophile maybe?
I will sleep.
Goodnight Mariak.
First episode done.
It is the weekend.
These are bike locks, right?
Nah, coffee, then crazy needs a bath, then we are going to buy a chair for toka.
Did you see Making a Murderer is getting a season 2?
I am super hungry.
Yeah.
Oh I think not.
It is too late and toka is back.
But tomorrow evening we can all evening.
Did I not talk enough.
Where were you all day today.
Are you not bored of all the pool and sun?
I want to hangout tomorrow night though.
I was getting worried.
I am a Mariamphile.
Speaking of looking nice, where is your face.
All these days and only one or two faces.
Be fine, do not panic, send lots of face; I love you.
Wake up.
Right, first seven episodes are downloaded.
Toka says 60-70% guilty.
I have thursday and friday.
I am home where are you are you fine I need juice.
I shaved everything.
We could have today when I got home from work.
7pm?
Are you hiding from people.
Did you see there is a documentary about it too? Called The Staircase 2?
.
How are you not indoors at this time.
I am getting sleepy.
I do like nucs because of the size.
Then the next episode.
I think he is hmmmm, 65% guilty, 35% not guilty.
Toka has monday, thursday, and friday off.
But if you want performance per money, a big custom desktop is in order.
I prioritise size and low power quite a lot.
My christmas present if you want to start saving.
Twitter videos do not work on my computer.
What is it?
Will you build a pc from bike locks?
When are you going home?
I have hummous and juice.
And toka has a new chair.
Do you want to hangout now?
Do you ever go back and listen to the playlists?
Come in come in come in.
It must be a communal thing.
I do have hummous, but not the bread I like.
I think he acts suspicious, but also that it was probably a fall.
Me too.
I do not want to search anything about it.
Toka is out tonight so I have to wait until tomorrow to binge it.
A bit tired.
Episode 2: Paul (60%, 40%), toka (65%, 35%).
Have you seen the jinx yet?
Hmm.
What is a code review comment?
Get more door matts for outside.
The marks are just appearing and I can count 11.
Is it a jetbrains account, does it integrate with an online service?
Can you bring  the thin bread?
When will you be home?
Be here.
Toka keeps falling asleep 15 minutes in.
Where are you. Did you make it home?
In intellij?
Get some spikes.
Do slugs not hate rough surfaces?
You must be home.
So mail sent to ben@lost.host will end up in the ben folder.
Which you would need to subscribe to to watch.
I think you should carpet outside and the outside walls too.
I have 14 episodes.
Oh no, 13 yeah.
Crazy just used my leg as a pull up bar.
But what is the backend of the code review feature?
Hi.
A bit hungry.
I also do not know why they are not considering pushing or grabbing the head and smashing.
Only beating and a fall.
If you are using lost.host mail, I changed the maildir structure.
By the producers of Goat Simulator.
And 10000% unity.
Did you ever get into HOI4?
How much of the video is pre-rendered though.
I started making a new mail for every account a while ago so it is to organize many aliases a bit better.
I think I hate mono games more though.
Episode 3: Paul(70%, 30%), Toka(55%, 45%)
Are you taking laffat?
Are you?
Does that make common sense to y'all?
I just wok up.
It looks like the No Man's Sky of Factorio.
Same people as Goat Simulator...?
Instead of mail going to inbox, it will go to a folder named after the person it was sent to.
They run better but I hate seeing .exes and dlls.
But where have you been.
I just retired the old lost.host server. Everything is moved over now.
The prosecutor has no case to be made. And then that pathologist who came to the conclusion that contradicted the 257 previous cases.
He still seems really weird though. It would not suprise me if he is guilty still.
You saw Making a Murderer, right?
No shit.
Although, my finger, the part that I bite, hurts.
Did you watch the video at 60fps?
Anyway, I subscribed to the newsletter to watch it.
I still have the most issues with unity games.
We are watching a series called "The Staircase."
Brendan Dassey is still in prison.
I am okay.
Of couse, they are always guilty.
Yeah, the alpha is nowhere near out yet.
Oh wow sanctum.
I hope you made it home fine.
We saw episode 7, and as soon as I saw the poker my mind went to Steven Avery with the planted evidence.
And will be until at least 2048.
I feel so tired.
It does look good, but as a baseline, unity until proven otherwise.
If XDG_something is not set, the game refuses to start and does not give any clues.
I am worrying.
Okay phew.
Episode 6: Paul(30%, 70%), Toka(25%, 75%)
Yeah, it is very similar to Making a Murderer and The Jinx.
They are documentary series about murder trails.
They exploited that minor with learning difficulties into admitting rape, murder, and mutilation of a corpse.
I am waiting for the second season of that.
Are you super okay?
Wake up.
We finished 9, the hearing for the retrail.
Oh it was super sweaty.
Huunnngry.
No, a murder documentary series. :D
Everything is fine with me but I am anxious. It is annoying.
I saw people watch one of the best Classic NES tetris players play it, and they thought he was fast and crazy but he was really slow.
Just play in practice mode.
I crudely edited Nada's photo into this picture.
Oh ginger just cleaned the black part from her eye with her hand.
I will break budget for a bit.
Quite bored tonight.
And very warm.
Do you have two bags, one just for used tissues?
I am greedy for the time.
I usually get 7 hours.
15 what?
All the way to 3.
I rewrote the budget service and remove about 220 lines.
Do you have qbittorrent?
Did you start watching it?
I woke up at the second alarm for the first time in agaes.
Yeah.
Did you leave?
Can you bring a little bag of coffee.
The virtual reality one?
The speed of it takes a little adjusting to, but it feels really good.
Are they related?
E
Hi.
No. It went away.
They do not call you The Magnificent Faciam for nothing.
Oh you look super.
Until she grows to 1.8m tall.
You better sleep.
I always sleep at 2 or 3 these days.
I usually always message you too.
You better be.
Have you made it by yourself before?
What have you made by yourself?
A bride for van winkle
<3
jstris is what you want.
The Staircase.
I came home a bit early.
Of course.
I think you have a lot of clothes.
When will you sleep tonight?
It is too early.
Now it is 96 lines of go, total.
And the proto service definition is 33 lines.
Romance, drama.
Then in qbittorent, file:open from url
Paste that magnet link.
Or did you sleep.
I am very tired.
You are so absent.
Why are you not super okay?
Why are you not here?
I do not have the internet or computer for that.
Oh.
Right click the torrent after adding, download sequentially, prioritize first and last peices.
Then after a little while, you should be able to open the partial file in your media player.
Streaming is downloading, then throwing away.
Wow what?
I forgot my keys for the second time ever.
Can you take them to me on the way to work?
Oh, when do you finish?
It it short?
This is correct.
I want this a lot.
Did you not go to the training?
I never have bad dreams any more, I find it had to imagine why people get them.
You get used to it.
Lisa recommended it two days ago.
But she did not get it.
I will watch another episode of the series in a bit.
And have juice.
Did you eat?
Congratulations on sleeping normally last night.
Mabruk tab3an Mariam.
I forgot my keys.
Also, I want to lock my bike.
Notifications are on.
Will you do anything today?
Enough for two cups.
Or three cups
Nervous or odd?
When I went home the streets were normal and the cafes were empty.
Qbittorrent lets you download torrents in order so you can start watching after you have buffered a bit.
I am awake.
But not very.
I will go to work.
Okay.
Oh this is too late already.
But when I left, they were watching something in magdy's office.
Okay, stop feeling terrible.
Toast is bread cooked again to become chrispy.
I do not get a chance to practice it much.
I just listen.
I think a lot of people's Arabic is not that good.
The electricity went off.
It makes me really happy knowing I make you comfortable.
Yeah, this is me.
Too risky.
Give me some notice though.
Did the film finish?
Do you want to watch it with me today?
Yeah.
I will go to the corner now.
What do you feel?
I am hoooooooome.
They never send an actual qualified network engineer out to test the cables.
Oh, missing the first day is going to stain the whole thing.
Do you want my voice?
Okay phew it was recording. I never tested.
They do not know any English.
Only, hello teacher, how are you.
Is this you?
In this photo.
This sounds like a type of flower.
It is home time.
Will you send you?
21-24inch 1080p TN monitors should not be more than 1400 I think.
Oh, because it enders in ower.
I used to also do it digitally.
Marlower
Mariawear sounds like a shoe brand.
Mariam sounds like the perfect person.
60 cigerattes?
I will but I am so sore and tired.
I think I will nap and do them when I wake up.
This just looks like a bath.
Dairy is one of the things that starts to taste awful after quitting it.
They just give zero fucks.
I think nobody but toka's older family wants me to.
Most people want to learn English better so they would rather I speak in English.
But also, her English is complete enough to express pretty much every thing.
No, I could not see you at all in her.
I get so tired around this time.
Then I wake up after 9.
Where is the super close mariam photo.
Start making an amazon shopping cart, get to the checkout and just leave it.
Are you mega clean.
When will you sleep?
I just got into bed.
The heat builds up so much without the fans.
Hmmm.
Were do you even have extra sugar and dairy?
I think her Arabic is not that good. There are many things she can express in English but not in Arabic.
You drove *whose* car?
Okay yallashower.
Or 250KG of fool.
Mariamraimarmiamram.
Hi.
And Hla is cloud.
Stay with me for a while.
I worry that too sometimes. But all the times I have asked her she said she did not.
Where is your super clean face?
I remember there was a super luxery pyramid hotel.
I joked about staying there, but I had not money to rent a place anyway.
I had no idea how the dog knew to do this, or how people were prepared to catch it.
Later, I was in the penthouse.
Things were suspicious but I was nice.
Mariower sounds like super mario clothes.
Come back.
Where is you in the jacuzzi.
I only had one coffee today.
The power kept going off tonight.
But it is not something I bring up directly.
I used to leave it logged in.
But now I logout.
Oh no, keep your arteries healthy.
Ben's mum complains that her husband smells like milk.
And he only drinks a normal amount.
You become really sensitive to the taste.
Oh. I waited so long.
*four
Do I send me enough?
If I had a phone I would send me everyday.
Eugh I want to meet you every day.
You are more.
I imagine you laying on top of me now and I just hug you so tight.
I will sleep.
Did you dream?
And the penthouse was all black.
Eventually they sat us down and then I noticed HR had gone.
I began to escape.
But then she undressed and she had some kind of rectangle with lines going across it instead of a genital.
Think of all the fool you can buy with 1300.
Did you order kofta...?
I have said things over the last two years.
Youssef at work today. His cup was half sugar and milk powder. I was just shocked.
Especially the after taste.
My stomach is so full of juice.
And my face became warm.
I hope you have nice dreams.
Half way down it gave up on the jump and started falling.
I think he was trying to sell them something.
At this point I realised they were going to harvest my legs.
Later in the dream, in the same penthouse, one of the girls suggested we have sex.
I am super careful not to fall off and head back.
Okay, no sleeping.
Oh wow.
I am here.
So we could move the water to the bathroom.
And yeah, I think you can not register on riot.lost.host, but you can in app.
Never.
My back hurts from sleeping too long.
I was on the bus passing it, and I saw a dog jump off the top balcony.
I did not recognise him at first because I just did not expect him to be there.
The oldest woman then gave me 120 dollars, which looked like toy money.
On each floor was a shop, and the people in the shops were all cult members.
Then I find out all the people here had it.
But it leads to a very high dead end.
I think I take terrible photos. I much prefer how I look in real life.
I do not, only in my dreams.
Poor cats.
Does the sun get there?
It is just water though.
Malabak needs delivered today :D
I think I will be 15 more minutes.
Are you home.
No, my manager asking if I smell like banana is.
I think I send loads at once and then none.
I get adrenaline when you say this.
Although it is summer.
Did you sleep.
I dreamt I went back to university to study again.
The professor of physics was a female and I was sitting with jack summers.
He asked if she had any paint, and she said yes and got him a plate of brown paint.
I was wondering why she got paint for the class.
Then later when she saw people not paying attention and drawing, she came over with a paint brush and just destroyed their drawing.
Then just before the end it dug its claws into the wall and slowed down enough for a person to catch it.
And magdsoft's HR was there.
It was a prince who lived there.
In the elevator down, it did not work as I wanted it to.
She had no idea what it was, but always had it.
This is all I remember.
I guess I dreamt then, and I messaged you and talked about it straight away.
Where is it?
I am so so so tired, and I have not had coffee, and I need to get ready in five minutes.
Work time.
Did you throw it all out?
I hope you are here.
Next to the oven gets really dirty and oily.
She said something about cycling, and I figured it out.
We tried going to different rooms but people were sleeping everywhere.
Later in the dream I was cycling to work with a skate board instead of a bike.
I end up taking a route up some construction site because I see other skateboarders coming from that way.
I woke up on the first alarm at 9:30, but decided to sleep again, and woke up just before 10.
And where is your face.
It is always when I have not had enough coffee.
I will take the skateboard.
The big bag needs only a small opening and to be securely shut.
Hi.
Does any water?
They also drink with a wet chin then eat.
Did it finish?
It is.
No.
Yeah, okay.
It is what?
Hold on, something must work, then I can leave.
Did you remember to face it up?
Did you sleep.
Wake up.
And I get a bit lost.
How are you?
Or the big bag?
Oh seperating the water and food will help.
Register is not enabled.
But remind me tonight.
Hmmm, I will tell you in a bit.
Or later.
I miss you, somehow.
I just did french on duolingo and wow, spanish is so much easier.
I have work to do at this time :(
Is Aya back yet?
Resetting password, I have no idea.
I can do it on the command line.
Is it fine?
I am home.
Sure.
Your mum would object to your swimsuit.
I managed to convince Magdy to upgrade the main server.
By moving stuff around, for an extra 3EUR a month, we can upgrade it from 2vCPUs, 7GiB RAM, 50GiB HDD to...
A dedicated xeon E3-1245v5 4c/8t 3.2/3.8GHz, 2x480 GiB NVMe SSD in RAID, and 32GiB DDR4 2133MHz ram.
Which is 6-8 times better.
It would be crazy. I could run everything.
Stick it on airplane and turn on wifi.
Oh.
a 50GiB hdd to 2x480GiB nvme ssds.
It is dog porn?
I am having koshary.
Did you not just eat with them?
I can still eat salad.
Was it fine fine.
I am fine. But hot and super full of hummous, juice, and coffee.
Oh why?
Quite a lot of work.
Yeah, that place.
o
She will still object.
It is breakfast time and I am so hungry.
We still have power.
What is it at?
I am going to upgrade the main magdsoft server to one that is 6 times as powerful in all aspects.
2x2.8GHz virtual cpus to roughly 8x3.2GHz.
Are you still going?
Whe do you go home?
I am home.
Still going with the porn.
I will break budget for a bit.
Uninstall from my profile too.
Why not?
Oh this is too early.
Looooser.
Saves a lot of power.
Actually, the time is not certain.
But it would be crazy.
7GiB of DDR3 ram to 32GiB of DDR4 ram.
3 euros a month more.
We have a plan to save 22EUR, then move that +3 to upgrade.
I think it is drum and bass day.
Hi **Mariam**
I am off on the 25th instead of the 23rd.
Do it in airplane mode.
There is no hope.
But next week probably.
They are dedicated, so limited in availablity.
Are you perfect?
And I need silence.
And mmmmous.
Could you open budget and tell me what the balances are for each account?
Use airplane mode.
mnkey
The key to the right of o.
Common changed...?
That doesnt make not common sense to me
We will go to a swimming pool this weekend.
I wish you come in.
If I make salad will you bring bread and noodles?
So it does not update.
What are the balances?
Which I remember.
Yeah, uninstall first.
ieon
I triple checked everything.
Are you home.
Oh it is part of the university course?
I never liked this practice.
Their job is to teach you, not to sell you to companies under the guise of experience.
I just woke up.
Which is the latest ever.
I wish I was off today. I am too tired.
I am exhausted.
I need to stop doing things.
Do you have to be up early tomorrow too?
Yeah.
All those numbers are correct but you.
You are at -410.
Oh.
mpkey?
Oh yes.
I will await the super clean and close face photo.
Hi.
Uh oh.
From what to what?
Without any vacations is illegal and you should leave that company.
Things are very different now.
I worry that you will be too busy for me.
"1409.30 for common."
Univerisity and work together is too much. You will fail both.
I thought you would not come back it was so long.
If wage negotiations fail, they will want to get rid of you and replace you with someone more content.
But they seem to be absent.
It is nice. Always a lot of work to do.
He is customer service.
What is that?
Ah, yes, there are 4 I think in minya.
I do not know much about minya.
All the web development is over there.
I am so ignorant.
Yeah, these are the correct numbers.
Both.
You should enjoy the long holiday breaks and do personal things.
Once you start work you will never get them again.
I am so exhausted this week.
He is not hiring anyone :D
Haha yes.
When going into wage negotiations, you always need a backup plan incase it fails.
This is a consequence of asking though.
The "tester" should be writing unit and android tests.
I currently get 6000 a month for 6.5 hours a day.
I know the pay here is much worse, and it is far from your house, but I still hope you come back.
Just me, baroody, and wahab.
Abdelrahman sayed is still here which is good because he is good.
He still tests a bit.
But only a bit.
HR, Sales, sales assistant, trainee developer (he is independant), iOS lead, Android lead, 1 android dev, two designers, 1 UX, 3 testers, 1 customer service, API guy, Boss.
If you work 6 days a week I will die inside.
Okay good.
I miss you.
Do you have any idea how hot and sweaty I am.
Your job is a developer, not a tester.
Which there are too many of.
I work too hard as it is.
Eslam tarik left, and we have a new guy who is alright.
He is nice, but the same level as Eslam I think.
And for a long time we had only one tester, Hend, she is nice but not much English.
Magdy also does very little work now which is good.
Hmm, everything.
I also became the socket guy recently.
It is unfair.
But also good for users and their batery life.
How is your mother?
Our 3 year contract finishes.
Wow.
Out of control, sure.
In October we should check the visa fees.
Which days are you not working.
How much are you currently paid?
We get all the national holidays here currently.
Yeah no, I would never accept that.
The team is much smaller now.
I like everyone better.
I guess everyone I did not like leaves.
Except you and kareem.
He hired two beginner testers recently.
Aparrently one of them is okay.
Beshoy came back, and he is good.
17 total I think.
I had breakfast.
The websocket standard is simple enough.
Something like that.
Which guy?
I remember him.
Though, my most exciting one is migrating the main server to a monster of a server.
I switched lost.host from ubuntu to nixos two weeks ago.
I am much happier with it now.
I am not interested in levels on top of a socket or whatever.
I do not like that there is no choice though.
Google have google mobile services running with special system priviledges on Android.
Nothing will be as reliable as firebase.
Did you change weight?
Do you still live super far away?
A better place, very very close to were magdy lives.
RelativeDateTimeFormatter
They work pretty well.
We have zero web guys here :D
He was the java dev.
Yeah I think so.
I get a good balance of both.
I churned out 5 golang sockets last week.
Ordering, chat, location stuff.
It is okay.
I am going to move in december.
If they are too much, we go back to the map and pick the second highest both visa-free.
Are you a prisoner under that denim?
I would need to research.
But friday if any day.
That is always the thought.
Hi.
Are you fine?
I used to get confused between him and abdelrahman sayed.
My list of tasks is changing every day.
I will switch the main server from 7GiB of ram, 2vcpus, and 50GiB hdd to 32GiB of ram, xeon E3-1245v5 at 4c/8t 3.4GHz, and 480GiB ssd nvme.
I could run everything I ever wanted on it.
And for push notifications, we are forced to use firebase.
Oh yeah, 112 egyptian applications in a year.
Are you here.
It looks like you have the prisoner top.
What is 18k?
I forgot my mouse at work.
Still about the same distance from work.
Oh hi, you look great.
New and lowend is usually better than old and high end.
But by the time you can afford and want an upgrade, three years has past, and all the sockets have changed.
Yeah, the weekend.
Yeah, we have a national holiday next wednesday.
She wants her mum to go.
I forgot my mouse at work.
But amr will deliver it.
It is about 8 so you can finish now.
Amr is dropping it off.
The dyshydrosis and humidity or heat I think.
Toka is still arranging it.
What will you do today?
It is the weeeeeeeeeekend.
The skin on my fingertips.
I will go get my mouse, hold on.
Okay I have my mouse.
# IT IS WEDNESDAY MY DUDE
Hmmm I wonder if a camera is good enough to see it.
The server became available and I got it!
It is very exciting.
Hi.
I am not at home, but join the Server Migration public room on chat if you are curious.
Oh wow, I can go into the bios.
Okay, I have my mouse.
Okay.
But not 3 and 4 :D
Toka's parents.
Yeah.
Also, they have a service that if the server stops responding to pings a techinician will fix it within 30 minutes 24/7.
Once you have your pay, you can do whatever.
Then telling them to get fucked and block them.
You could even spend some time studying for a different field.
Toka got fired by email with no notice.
There is no ambiguity in the email.
My hands are really destroyed.
Finally the weekend.
I am fine.
The server is being set up now.
Are you fine?
I am home now.
Yes.
KVM
I am using icedtea as a client.
You have no contract.
You can have two drawers.
I am sleepy at toka's parents' house.
On mattermost, search for it.
Keyboard, video, mouse redirection.
No idea.
A java thing.
They are cowards.
I think the merge of the website server into the mail went well this morning.
:/
No, you just got fired.
Also, spend as much time as you need finding a nice job.
Attempt other options if you want to move away from teaching.
Reply to the email asking when you should collect your final pay.
Please do not feel bad.
Omar is too coward to talk to you right now.
So is she.
HR is filled right now.
Be here.
I never liked any of them from the beginning.
Either the manager gets fired or she is.
She is into a different employee.
It is very unlike the boss not to answer her calls.
So I presume so.
Hi.
I am here.
You still need your pay for half a month, so you need to be diplomatic here.
Assuming you are fired, I would presume it was because you complained too much.
I would recommend being completed neutral and talking about nothing until you get your money.
I just imagine if you could be happy there, things would be great.
She did not get on well with her manager.
Also, the boss, and the manager are not answering calls.
The company was a small startup.
Nothing in the company is formal.
I fucking hate start ups.
I have a lot more context, and I think it is.
If magdy told me I was fired like that, and then something happened and I was not fired, I would leave the company.
Yeah, fuck them.
I do not trust middle men.
No, because I hate recruiters.
And Omar prefers Asmaa.
While you do not have a job, the jar will be 40%, you will be 30%, and I will be 30%.
These are not people you should care about.
It is far too soon for this, but is there any position in Magdsoft you would ever try?
she
Yeah, I know. I have told her.
Stay calm and nice until you have the money.
Then tell them to get fucked.
I always told her the boss is not your friend.
He refuses to answer.
If it is not the end, it should be the end.
She does not want to teach any more.
I always apply by phone or email.
I only trust email, phone, and in person.
Yeah, but when you applied, I was running the servers so obviously they got your application :D
I would never use a middle man.
You also need the fridge money.
If you want an explanation, after you get your pay, and a few weeks later.
Yeah.
Yes.
No.
She is not into him.
Wuzzuf is where I found magdsoft.
Time needs to pass.
Toka phoned them without knowing and then Ameny called me for an interview.
Our own product.
Yeah, I already take too much time off :D
Going out is for the young.
And even if it was a joke, or something else, you can not trust them with job security at that point.
We have developers, testers, customer service, sales, user experience, design, and backend design.
Nope, my message was too ambigious.
There as in at my work.
We could have breakfast together every day :D
When will you be home?
But she liked the boss.
Her manager did not make that decision without him knowing.
It said.
Dear Toka,This is to inform you that your last working day is today!--Sent from my iphone
Form?
That work is irregular.
They never replied to my email (rude)
This is too long term for me.
I like to focus on short term work.
You and magdy can worry about those long term things :D
She wants to do HR.
I consider online forms too shitty and informal.
And the top image, the light is at a different radius as the bottom.
I slept for 11 hours.
I am fine though.
Yeah, but I just want a bright light that detatches easily on my handle bar.
Hmmm.
I am loyal to Magdsoft :D
I wish Magdsoft had its own service though.
I do not know, but a product we can really care about.
I mean this weekend.
I have been for about 3 hours.
We can rearrange the living room tomorrow.
Also, the bike in the top image is not really outside - the background is edited in, and so are all the colors.
No but for reasons I will discuss next week or so.
Hi.
I really miss you.
Instead of making services for other people.
What do you mean?
As in, I like being given the work and worrying about short term goals.
Anyway, spoilers.
If the changes are bad, I will fire you by email.
I manage the email server so I can be who I want :D
But what if I die.
I do not dig in like that.
I really need to relax.
Trying to get kubernetes to run.
I am still unsure if I even want it.
Sliced bread.
Wow, no, why would I stick all that weight on my valve and risk damaging the valve?
Which is the first time in weeks
I mean in all the other time.
It worries me that I can not imagine magdsoft functioning without me. Like I have dug myself in so deep.
It is all the server stuff.
If I dissapear, all the services are running on the servers, and I am the only one who really understands what is going on.
I am a point of failure.
Do you like chocolate halawa sandwhiches?
Also, note the bike in the bottom pictures is a crappy bike, and the top picture is a good bike.
Oh you are completely free until tuesday.
What will you do?
And a red light for below the seat at the back.
But I do not really want to talk about it more than I have to.
Hi.
Although, I am off on wednesday.
The weather is so much hotter these days.
I wonder if the pool will be hot.
So when the ip changed, not all of them knew.
Anyway, I want better breaks, and a better handle bar, and a better seat, and a better everything that makes cycling better.
Things are busy and exhausting for both of us.
Okay.
Wish me luck.
I will get into bed and hope you come.
I do not like them already.
How much are you paid?
Oh wow, that is really cool.
Toka's mum did not want to go, so we will just go together next thursday.
What are you doing?
Hi.
I am just getting ready for work.
My brain is fried from all the server stuff.
Tokatokotkta
HR said I will be paid all the over time hours.
For what?
Will you sleep through it.
It is a decentralised system for name lookups.
Also, the websites I had running on both servers, so requests to the old ip served the same content.
Google are one of the bigger DNS providers.
No.
The ip address I just sent.
I got into bed and am in full talk attention mode. FTAM.
In assembly?
Why was it off?
okay, so now I actually do have to go into the bios of the server to enable virtualization.
The pool will be next week.
Just finished the staircase.
It was worth watching.
And candace is the devil.
Schedule is what you need.
I had a big breakfast.
Yesterday I had 4 samboosas.
I want juice.
So I will not try to get down to zero.
Does he not keep records and evidence of everything.
Well, now cloudflare are getting it wrong.I wonder if they asked google.172800sGoogle are using 54835 seconds, and then asking servers with a ttl of 172800 seconds, then asking our server.48 hours.Same for cloudflare.
It is dns propagation.
But if two people are connected to chat on different servers, the websocket will not communicate.
And the databases are not the same.
It is the nature of changing the IP address of a domain name.
A lot of people rely on them for DNS.
Toka got fired.
So today I have a sad and angry toka.
Are you okay?
Are you here?
35 pound an hour is about 9000-10000 a month.
Wait what.
I get 43 an hour.
Never mind.
It is work time.
In total?
I thought it was 6 hours a day. 2 to 8.
My hands are so disgusting.
They feel constantly like they need washed, but washing them does not change how they feel.
It is your choice.
It should be around an extra 925.
Packing up in 5 minutes.
I feel like I do not know if you are fine enough.
Oh no.
22C
Okay wake up.
I only get 24 pound an hour.
They feel sweaty and grippy and numb.
And sticky
But I have to or my job security is at risk.
What kind of trouble.
Just went to the bakery for the first time in months.
Do not worry.
Toka made a sponge cake.
It is a way of spreading constantly changing knowledge around the world.
Because chat is used a lot, there exists many caches in dns servers around the world.
Or are configured to know quickly.
Yeah, no more than 48 hours.
Eventually all of these will be magdsoft.com.
Do not worry about it.
It only resolves our domains, so you need a secondary.
I am so hungry.
And coffee, I need coffee.
But I always do not want to go to work.
bolobloblobl
Are you super fine?
Legal things always go unfairly.
You better not break down.
But services that are not used much, or sites. Do not have caches ready, so when they change and someone requests, they try to find out.
And it has been 36 I think.
apis.magdsoft.com. is a cached dns result.
Then use another one.
Are you planning on fighting with them?
This is the only picture I have here.
From p1 to p2.
Then Mrs Hope again for the last year and she was great.
But more than that, I do not like not talking at this time.
Once you understand it, you understand why my answer to why things are not working being DNS.
Your nails are not long. They look weird because it looks like you take away that white bit where they join the skin.
Hid
Then mrs miller who was great.
Yeah, she has been typing none stop today.
When you put out hate, you get hate back, and that cycle just grows.
This is not something I want to talk about though.
I have enough to cope with with the firing.
And gone home.
A song reference.
And I said, I do not have the patience.
I do not know. I just wish it.
Did you sleep.
Yeah.
I am at work.
Hunk
My parents have lots of photos of me sleeping.
ffmpeg -i input.opus -o output.mp3
ffmpeg -i input.opus output.mp3
If you always want the correct entries, use our dns server directly as your primary dns server.
217.182.89.213
This one.
You can make a tiny mistake like forgetting a `.` and why can I not get a https certificate for a domain for three hours? DNS.
How are you?
The top part of the fingers after the second join.
They look swollen.
But your hands look normal.
It will be the lighting.
I find this practice really disturbing.
Ginger is sleeping at my head.
We would program it to go down a hallway.
The teacher used to pretend it his and after lunch you would have to find it.
She also had a little birdy that she used to explain how she knew what all of us were doing.
She was my favourite teacher I think.
Then Mr Collins who I liked.
Come back.
I just feel too busy and that I do not spend enough time with you.
I do too.
I always recommend her to stop and to not do things.
What are you doing?
I feel like I have an anti elastic band we are attached by.
We used to have a programmable robot in primary one that we all loved.
Mrs Hope.
I just told her to be careful.
Sure she gets sad at times. And so do I.
But 95% of the time she is fine.
Okay you can talk about happier things now if you want.
Shorty get low low low low, Apple bottom jeans, boots with the fur.
Oh I made a joke.
Patience is the British name for solitaire.
Oh no. Why are you sighing.
Everythingly?
How do you wish it be?
Probably not that akward.
Oh yeah suuuure.
Then I had Mrs maylor and I did not like her.
Then it was a teacher I forgot.
I am sorry I do not talk enough.
Yeah she is not how she likes people to think she is.
When will you watch black mirror?
And the two films.
Oh wow it is too low, even shorty does not want it that low.
By cutting the anti elastic band.
You can not sleep without giving me something to dream about.
I just woke up.
Little pretzels, bread, date bread things, hard bread things, breadsticks, fateer.
The usual.
Tokatoktkta
Where ever you want it.
But inside a quotation mark they are ignored.
Let me do it.
My idea would be the speakers are on my desk, but you connect using bluetooth.
I would have not said you do not work there anymore.
So Asmaa now has to defend herself.
But I am trying not to get involved.
She is not.
It is like she romanticises it. Which is very wrong.
You are the happy thing.
What do you watch on it?
I wish we were closer.
Good morning.
input and output is the filename.
It depends where the file is.
So maybe the other way around.
Yeah, this is what I expect.
I would have said they fired me.
When they say why, just say you will have to ask Asma.
I was actually thinking about this at work.
Okay.
This is fantastic.
It should have the obvious consequences.
She said to me, why do you not try getting into card games?
Everythingly.
Wake up.
I actually get fed a lot at work.
A full breakfast, and often dinner before I leave too.
awk
That is pretty hot.
hmmm
Show me the command.
Spaces and ( and ) all have special meanings in a terminal.
It is done.
I do though.
It is truthful and objective.
Giving them more information is not unbiased.
Asmaa made a mistake.
ffmpeg -i ~/Music/whereever/file.opus ~/output.mp3
The input is the file "path"
ffmpeg -i "~/Music/LP - Lost On You (Deluxe Edition) - 2017/LP - Lost On You (Addal Remix).opus" "~/Music/LP - Lost On You (Deluxe Edition) - 2017/LP - Lost On You (Addal Remix).mp3"
Do you want to move the furniture today?
Not you alone.
And if the student even likes you a bit they will not trust her.
But make sure it is clear that you did not influence their choice to leave.
Be careful because with Omar crying it is not a good sign for the stability of the company.
Packing up.
I am home.
I need to megarelax.
I am worried about how long it has been sitting out.
I should look out the photos of aswan.
There is a wedding party or something annoying me.
I tried to play the game and my computer overheated and turned off.
Which happens at 102C I think.
My computer overheated and turned off for the first time.
Which is 102C I think.
Yes.
Okay.
Opus should work fine on your phone though.
The other issue is what we do with the speakers.
So you have no wire and you just have to change the mode to bluetooth.
Hmm wait, maybe you do not have bluetooth.
Since they found out asmaa fired you first, this becomes their anchor point.
Nah, let them leave.
Should pack up in about 10 minutes.
If I cook that mashy, it can not go in the fridge for 3 hours.
Well, we have a new double bed.
The makers of Gone Home made a new game called Tacoma and I have it now.
I hope it plays smoothly.
Hi home.
I have done 24 hours overtime this month so far.
Is the mashy cooked or uncooked?
Yeah it is hot.
6 hours is the safe limit after contact with water.
No.
It is bad.
It is why I feel like we are not talking enough.
It is why I feel tired all the time.
I do not know what that would achieve.
Why did she kill it.
I am here.
<3
Okay.
To megax.
If it is hours away I am going to freeze it.
I am not cooking all that mashy so I can eat 15 of them.
Freezing it already makes it mushy.
Cooking then freezing then cooking will be mega mushy.
And cooking it heats it up and it can not go in the freezer.
I do not want to get ill.
It was sore to touch.
Brooms.
I can confirm this is forever.
But keep it.
But I can never decide which source to use because I can not imagine the end result.
I used moisturizer on my fingers and I think it helped.
gimp can probably do it.
When they ask why, tell them to ask the company.
When will you be home so we can cook it?
And at that point food poisoning is certain.
Oh jamie, cairo.
Yeah, we can have a look down south.
There is a tonne of mashy.
But I am waiting for toka to come home to cook it.
Yeah.
They do not even know how to explain or admit it.
Okay.
Eugh.
A lizzard.
Why did she not shoo it away.
With brooms.
Are you ever coming home?
Oh you can not be asleep already :(
No.
What did she kill.
I either just blinked or the power flickered.
I have shooed many away.
Out a door.
Shoo it all the way.
I will be in bed after my juice.
Maybe email.
No way.
dyshydrosis
It does not matter if they lie to the students.
Because they ask you, then they find out they were lied too.
You have no reason to talk to the company any more.
My stomach is anxious or it needs to poo.
Love you.
Just as long as you finsh for bed time.
2am.
I want to make another picture but I worry it will never turn out as well.
Let me check.
Or do you want to automate it so you can process 100 photos with one command?
Warts are contagious.
If donia tells them you were fired, you are not the anchor point.
You should say nothing more to the students other than I was fired.
Why are we not playing it.
Move desk and stardew.
How sleepy are you.
Goodnight Mariak.
It does not have any presets, but if you get the watermark you want, it is easy to just paste it on top of the image and export.
A poo attack.
It is very easy to edit this watermark out of the photo though.
Dual exposure is actually something I really want to try. I think my camera does not support it though.
I hope not late late either though.
Be here for the after-bedtime.
Okay fiiine. I will sleep.
If you draw a picture of the kind of watermark you want, I could make the image that you would layer on top of the photos.
I know what a wart is.
I do not think your lip has warts.
And they lose trust.
After work.
Wake up.
But it helps force crediting the photographer in most cases.
That photo looks either dual exposed, or edited, but it looks really nice.
Stardew. Multi. Player.
Photoshop can do it automatically.
If someone wants to steal a photo they can steal it no matter how hard you try.
I will not be early.
Okay, yeah that explains it.
Okay, I will look for solutions after work.
ing
Packing.
It always helps me.
It is early bed time.
When will you finish.
Will I be able to stay awake.
Are they at your place?
Is it not too late to go home.
Hi Mariam.
Does music ever help?
Ahhh grass.
You can put the mashy on.
She probably just thinks you are lisa button.
My head hurts it is so tired.
I hope I sleep well tonight.
But I am so hot.
Wake up for morning time.
Just boot it.
It looks like a sweet.
It looks too vunerable.
Really tired.
What is it for you?
I am falling.
Headache.
Call the police.
Building then packing.
Yes, but mostly from coffee.
How are you?
It better have you riding the robot like a skateboard.
Goodnight mariak.
Good morning.
Nothing is build.
Mmmm.
Oh that is too weird.
Does she have video uploading internet.
You know it giiiirl.
I have a long weekend.
Soon.
Are you good?
I hope to wake up to your face.
Or three.
I am yes.
I think it might be inside a backup file.
Rude.
I am.
But it is very very very hot.
And my face and head hurt.
Pool
It is official bed time now.
So I set the home phone alarm.
That would be alarming.
This is my favourite permission one so far.
Beshoy is great now.
I never transfered it to the new server.
Anyone thinking I will host them a website can get screwed.
I will play darkwood.
I think it is bed time.
We will go to a poll on Thursday.
And order breakfast tomorrow.
That is funny.
Do you remember the fabric account for garo?
Okay.
Hmmm.
Yes.
I do not run mysql or php on lost.host
I am packing up now.
They are so much better like this.
When will you sleep.
You said there was no work until Tuesday but the first two days have been work.
But not easy to set up at all.
I am home.
Which one?
Did the movie finish?
Are you sleepy?
As usual.
Toka's alarm has become unreliable.
And my alarm fell down the back of the bed months ago.
Our cats got shaved and groomed.
It is nice them having no claws.
Why is Nada sleeping beside you?
Not in this heat.
I am completely silent.
Though, I have not seen him do a mobile app yet.
I will tell you when I know.
Today was crazy hot.
I only saw them all once.
The power is off.
Only a little. My head hurts too much.
Toka.
I need longer arms.
You look like a cartoon.
Will you sleep on my belly instead?
But we start.
But I itch with every tiny hair.
Sounds like a martial arts bee.
Why would you moan?
I usually wake up instantly and get up when I hear an alarm.
I feel like I am cooking.
Is it bed time.
Nono the time for sleep is not upon us.
I spend five to ten minutes making micro adjustments.
Getting smaller and smaller.
And then eventually I flip over since I like facing outwards.
I feel like you are working 7 days a week.
My goal in life is maximize free time.
I woke up.
I will forget about it until saturday.
I can not reach it.
AlARMing
The channel is consistently fantastic.
Ginger is sleeping on my belly.
I am imagining someone saying carton weird.
That must be one of the weirdest things someone has said to you.
I actually can not breathe after a minute of that.
Toka does not move at all.
Toka is getting up at 8 to visit her mum.
A Cook show will record her making pigeon.
Or, I want to see you.
I just microslept.
I am dehydrated and you see how much I am drinking.
Or crashes for older versions.
Jeez, you are trusting me too much there.
It is just the fabric account access, right?
Washed, hair cut, nail cut.
A cartoon of joy.
In general, it is just too much weight on top of my ribs and everything.
I am very very fussy with my final resting position.
When I heard she was making pigeon I concluded it is a cookshow for the homeless.
Hmm I did take a photo of myself at work today to test a chat application I made.
Did you sleep.
Goodnight Mariak. I love you.
Anything cold.
It is too too too too too too hot.
My head hurts even more and it is even hotter.
And it was daddy and lisa visiting for a day.
After working for a while you can.
Will you send you? I miss you.
If it is cold.
I woke up.
The table...?
Yes.
No, but I am not working until saturday.
For reference.
Nah.
I got sick of debian.
At home I am using gentoo.
But it would be on the server and I need my computer.
Will you leave me the most wonderful message for when I wake up?
Why would you be on the show...?
I had a dream that I woke up and toka said there was a suprise waiting in the kitchen.
This is just because I pull my chin out, and you can not see the rest of the hair at the side or neck.
Breaaakfast.
My stomach is not big enough to drink more.
Yeah.
When should I expect them?
Can you show me the bage that shows the adoption of the latest builds?
This is not your google account.
Okay, that is fine then.
You ordered for two.
And we do not have change.
I am trying to make a new picture.
One of them, yes.
Maybe eventually I will know what a good source photo looks like.
I have peach juice with ice cubes.
KRACK
I think almost all network devices should be vunerable to it.
I can let you borrow my wifi adapter.
I think he is going to the super market with 100.
If you could send me the crash on the worker profile screen it would be handy.
We can not reproduce it.
At work I am using arch.
Arch is nice when you do not need to configure and worry about things.
Gentoo is nice when you really care about the system and have the time.
SimpleDateFormat("EEEE dd MMM yyyy", Locale.getDefault()).format(Date(long))
On my server I am using nixos.
Which I really like for the server.
I am waiting for toka to come home but it will be late.
I think our internet speed is very slow.
If you want to try something I am interested in trying but never bothered to try.
Not even the hardware manufacturers would bother.
I hardly ever use it.
You must scan attached devices for known vunerabilities.
This is the only clue I will give you :D
KiB/s?
Kb/s is kilobits per second.
Most of the time people mean kibibytes.
We are only paying 160.
I am home.
uTorrent shipped spyware for a while.
Which just means it is not an option.
What are you planning to hack?
cmd+r, cmd, enter, hack.exe
OpenVAS should help you with that.
Which is unlikely if all devices are up to date.
A kibibyte is 8192 bits
Anyway, my internet is around 40KiB/s right now I think.
Jeez.
200KiB/s 100GiB is actually enough for us two.
We usually use about 100 a month.
I think one of my biggest regrets was watching any tv at all growing up.
Are you home?
It took me quite a while to even figure something out.
I can not even play music :/
qbittorrent
My internet needs renewed, I can barely load any pages.
That recent WPA2 vunerability.
How hard can it be?
I am pretty sure you will hit a wall straight away.
And then find one that allows you to gain full control of the device, remotely.
Good luck.
Roughly 8x.
A kilobit is 1,000 bits
10Mb/s ethernet is before my time :D
GiB
100 Gib/s -> / b * B (/ 1 * 8)
Your mouth and nose in this photo were too flat and I could not add them well.
I did at somepoint have your head shape in it, but I got rid of it because I did not like the border.
But I like it.
Not yet.
Because who updates a router with security patches?
Or kb/s?
KiB/s is kibibytes per second
All file sizes are measured in bytes, drives are measured in bytes, but network speeds are measured in bits/s.
100Mb/s eathernet is 12.5MiB/s.
I have to wake up at 8am to go to the swimming pool.
Also wrong :D
I am too hot to eat.
And an AC unit would dominate power usage.
**arrested
Even the room she is in smells.
This and smoke.
A kilobyte is 1,000 bytes, a kibibyte is 1,024 bytes.
A 10Gb/s network line is 1.25GiB/s.
But I want to stay awake and have time.
Also, fuck everyone for having too many children.
The denser the population, the more strain on the network.
I think we get 120 or 140.
Are these two shows?
I used to watch robot wars, and gladiator.
It is revolting.
Come in.
You miss bananasaurus?
Him
Wait Aswan, sorry.
I just fill up with cold water.
I like using low power.
Did you go to bed.
Toka smells like a pub.
Yeah we hang our washing up inside and it is dry in 4-6 hours.
Our internet is back to normal.
Yes.
And a personal guide type person to look after us.
Yeah Aswan is hotter.
Did you see the super fast japanese ones?
They can just do things fast.
Nah, it is too sandy outside.
I started using this which is handy.
Do you need holidays in just for the pets?
ovemememember
Aswan is way better.
I think the biggest convincing factor will be photos.
I am working right now, but tomorrow I can get toka to find them.
31st of october?
The video is sped up.
I will get into bed.
The video is not really sped up.
There are much faster robotics than this.
I am falling.
Realfeel of 40C right now.
I did not want to go because it was too hot.
What is happening?
He is like 70.
It drops 6C in novemember.
I have been to both places, and I am more like jamie.
This week is stupidly hot.
Yeah, helwan is nicer.
We get this house on an island.
You will be wearing jumpers.
We can go for a trek into the dessert.
It is hot water bottle cold.
And there is no heating or insulation to keep the heat in.
El gouna is dirty and really fake.
Yes, but be aware I am moving servers.
I finally finished.
I know I am with toka.
It scares me too much that you will go away or lessen.
Okay time to not worry about what I just said.
Certain perhaps desirable but improbably futures being ruled out.
Oh we have not had lightning or rain for a couple of months now.
Novemember is coooooooold though.
No, november is cold.
Hello Mega Marian.
Night time can get down to 2-3C in decemember.
This is a good temperature though.
Hurghada is a mini cairo.
It is the type of place you will not want to leave your hotel.
no.
Notroushirtifocktions.
Or certain unlikely futures are elimated.
Good morning.
To chill?
Aswan is not a touristy place.
Aswan is much more untouched.
Oh okay.
I put notifications on.
Toka came home.
Okay time to stop thinking and be open.
But the thought of someone else loving you make me wither.
That is the one I dread the most.
It was pretty common in Spring.
I worked then slept.
My body hurts too much.
But I am sure their are pool clubs.
there
Novememomemeomeber would be better for jamie.
This is completely fine do not worry.
Call me when you are ready on hangouts.
Just do not book anything without asking us first.
Where are you.
Yes.
Be awake.
Yeah that one.
Maybe this will work.
Or like a revolver thing.
I will get into bed.
Or maybe it is the thought of you loving someone else more.
And just woke up.
These are the only two windows free and open source guis I can find.
Sleeping too much.
And the heat.
I hope your free day does not fill up.
And it just stayed there ever since.
The playlist sounds very hogwartsy.
No.
This is just the dev frontend.
The backend and database are not there.
Okay I am happy with the server transitions.
I was close to making something like this:
Did you listen to the playlist.
The moon is not here.
I feel like I am tired but it is still so early.
Is it shower night dance time?
How are you?
It took 5 hours last night. Without dev, I have to do that today.
How did you never notice the mat before?
Your face looks flawless.
I like Oskar Schuster - Fryderyk most, obviously.
These are the songs I have been singing along to.
Like I said twonoodleornottwonoodle
It was a waterpaint filter.
Are you home yet.
They both are.
Because it was novemember.
ovememeberoelegereverever*
Actually december the 20th.
Toka put it there to stop my bum getting griddy.
> Tonoodleortonottonoodle, that is the question.
Ginger is sleeping with her eyes open.
Just two.
She is having a face twitching session.
She keeps licking the air.
It is super hot.
It is Aswan.
I am having coffee then mashy.
I think the server transfer went pretty well.
We rearranged the living room. What do you think?
You should know all these songs already.
Yeah, we do.
But screw that, kotlin gradle plugin.
Are you home from the pool?
I need the winter to come back so I can be me again and wear onesies and jumpers.
Are you crazy?
Are you any hairier?
Do you disaprove?
Toka's mum and dad sit on prayer mats too sometimes.
TOO LATLE
I think she is just rem sleeping.
Our eyes twitch when we are in rem sleep.
Yeah groovy is a proper language.
You can do this all in kotlin.
I really dislike wearing just t-shirts.
I can not imagine it.
I imagine you dancing looks as awkward as me dancing.
Who did you go with the pool with?
Good morning.
Is it in the games folder?
I will leave now.
What are you suddenly buying?
Okay enough work stuff this morning.
Story focused, I guess.
Yeah.
At all.
That did not stop you dancing.
Oh, at last.
Is it?
That is why.
It is quite a long film I think.
A bride for van winkle.
It is more just romance drama.
Be awake.
But hold on.
`./GoneHome.x86`
Wake up.
It is 34C with realfeel 32C.
I need to shower too.
Werewolves.
Are you home.
What will you watch?
It is by the guy who made Old Boy.
Okay phew.
The other film is less thillery.
The other film is very similar.
Crazy just filled that space.
Hmmmmm.
I am a little busy.
On my computer, open a terminal
`cd ~/Games/gone-home`
`./GoneHome.x86_64`
Nono, I logged in and fixed the crash :D
Did you open the hoover bag and photo how much dust we picked up yesterday?
How are you?
It is no where near as hot outside.
Where are you?
Fuck
No I will not saying anything to not spoil anything.
It is bed time.
Okay double phew.
Are you sleepy?
I do not remember which I liked better now.
Did you sleep.
Why are you not over my head.
Play gone home.
Something because you are bored?
Did you start playing it?
Thanks.
Time for Mariam! Keep your 1 day streak going.
25km/h winds...?
Wait, ask me again in the morning.
I finally got tomcat running without any root.
Now to try to sandbox it.
But not proceduraly generated.
Do you want it for gaming?
I will say nothing.
Only a little.
I did I like it enough to recommend it.
Oh so abrupt.
Goodnight Mariak.
Make better answers.
Offline.
Do you want to play a game?
You should play it on my computer for faster graphics.
If that does not work
Okay.
I am huuunnngry.
I refused koshary :(
Why is real feel lower.
I will sleep.
Me and toka are really enjoying the game "Darkwood"
It is a creepy top down survival game.
Yes.
Okay done.
I am here in bed.
Shop for some free time.
Oh I am special.
I think in the activity is the better place for them.
But if you have a Repository, there.
Is it a surpise?
surprise
But for a good developement pc, that money is better spent on cpu and ram.
I am home.
Maybe.
Wherehwwhrrehere
I just spent almost an hour trying to get a lizzard out.
It kept going into a really thin thing behind the cupboard.
Sata is too slow.
Hello you.
Today you are a verticle prisoner.
The photos you smile in are special.
Arrived where?
Buy or pirate it.
Usual time.
Not yet.
When I am at work.
suprise
I am packing up.
Yeah this evening.
Like 25% gaming 75% dev.
Also, how much balls fast storage do you want?
For a shitty one maybe.
128 is probably fine.
They are super cheap and you can store all your movies and stuff on it.
You do not learn to driver in the passenger seat, then your first time driving, they are not there.
Did you smile today?
I am.
They do not disgust me.
They are like tiny dinososaurs.
Will you make it to a three day streak.
The 850 is out dated.
I need to poop.
Are you?
Do you need slow large storage too?
Do you want a slow computer?
1GB is still about 10-15egp.
Did you super clean and close face today?
Does she live near?
I will find it maybe in the morning.
It was worth the sacrafice though.
Probably.
But I really wish they would leave, it is in both of our interest.
Also, do not by sata.
Do I start a Paul streak?
Is aya still there?
Or development?
In your repository :D
Good morning.
But yes.
I need water and juice and coffee and food and rest.
For a good gaming pc you need the best graphics card.
Did they like you the most?
It does not matter how powerful the computer is if you use a hard drive, it will still feel very slow.
500 is too big.
I recommend getting a 1TiB hdd though.
Another teacher should have stayed with you and took a back seat.
Oh so you were not fully alone.
They get so scared.
Nope you look happy.
Or laundry camoflauged.
Just 99% of the time.
This is one of the reasons I like the other games better.
And dry.
Have you hair?
What are you doing today?
I think the adapter should be restrained to adapting.
What did you do.
I just got home from work and it was super busy.
You should make a percentage of each.
Maybe 256.
The power keeps going out.
Eventually I trapped it and threw it off the balcony.
But with a diary cover and plastic bowl.
Lizzard size.
It is bedtime.
It is a long way to travel to not stay the whole night.
As long as you do not see my finger tips.
What is Aya doing?
Why do you think you looked bad?
The family is too important.
Keeping your family alive is the game.
Though I should point out.
When they revolted because I revoked it, I crushed them.
I want a pear.
I just had to deal with a lizzard for an hour.
And the power keeps dying.
Hi.
And faithful.
And eventually I had everything.
I will tell you when she figures it out.
I feel drowsy.
They look like they are 55 years old.
I do not feel it at all.
But do not trust kotlin synthetics.
I do not use it because of this reason.
The best code is the code that lets you make the fewest mistakes.
<3
And like you live in a laundry machine.
Are you awakey?
I can not promise I look good all the time.
Ginger keeps sniffing my face and ears.
She licked my cheek.
She is being odd.
Is she practicing Karate?
I had about 400.
I owned everything.
I remember it being Spain.
If you want to join then.
I told him but I will have to tell him every week for two months before he does it.
I did revoke every title once.
Darkwood is great.
Baby.
Wake up.
What is it?
`val time `
Static fields in activities with state, tut tut.
When do I find out about this surprise?
Is the surprise when you come?
My sister is coming in November.
It will probably be the very end of October to early November.
Come back.
I will.
Dyshidrosis.
The medicine.
I have drank plenty.
StudentsReportsActivity.sTime
It lets you access any view reference from anywhere.
Kotlin synthetics is just findviewbyid, with caches.
I think if you use databinding, and get rid of the static field and use proper data passing, the error will go away.
Use a DateFormatter, not this, this is not international.
I can not tell from this, I do not have enough contect.
7 days?
Make it 10.
You just need your flight money.
What days are those?
If this happens, the dialog will never dismiss.
So keep the data in a ViewModel (the new ones)
class RecentlyHolder(var binding: ItemStudentReportsDetailsCardBinding) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(binding.root)class RecentlyDateHolder(var binding: ItemStudentReportsDayCardBinding) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(binding.root)
Are you here?
Can you hear?
Which means you can import the wrong binding into a scope where it does not exist.
It is more error prone.
Also, the databinding library is still faster.
The databinding library does not find anything.
Packing up now.
Yeah that is about right.
6 days holiday for me then.
I might have to buy some computer things.
38inch.
This means if you do not pass it, it is by default a new instance of an empty list.
WaitingDialog.dismiss()
Yeah, okay. For how long will you come?
We can go places within 10 days.
Yeah it is fine.
If the adapter is recreated, which will happen when the view is recreated, you want your data to stay alive.
Shit, a bear!
Let me find the camera.
Why are you irritated.
We are waiting for availability.
Once october comes we will be looking a lot more seriously.
BH<AnyModelBinding> really.
Friday.
It is fine.
Oh yeah.
Actually.
Two monitors.
The famous WaitingDialog.
Why is this list Observable?
Instead of making these wrapper classes, use something like my VH class.
Sorry BH for bindingholder
My top has a tear :(
Did you sleep.
I will go to work.
Kareem wanted to meet me on friday.
This should be called immediately in onSuccess.
It also means writing the line once, instead of four times.
The data should not be attached to the adapter instance.
And reuse it for all adapters.
Are you home.
My chin is a mess. I am sorry.
I am a bit tired.
Are you tired?
Where is your good face?
It is still at my list of Top 1 Things to See.
I struggled to get up this moring.
I went back to bed and woke up at 11am.
When I got to work I took a muscle relaxant for my back, and it make me even more drowsy.
Yeah but alone, and not this weekend.
I do.
The info page of me...?
Do you ever observe it?
Have a look at the new ListAdapter class. It is much better.
This ain't fair.
I don't care.
Get to the lair!
Don't you dare.
Then slept in my chair for the next 30 minutes.
That is way way too early.
Giiiiinger.
BH<AnyModel>
We can figure out your computer in real life.
What?
Identity theft.
attorney..?
And my eyes are so baggy.
I just hope you are happy.
I think either november or december will be the last month here.
Wake up.
Yeah.
I need to wait until she confirms she is travelling though.
You can go twice.
Let me check something.
Also if police people got him, how do you know it is not a trap?
I will tell you when I know more.
Toka is going away for the weekend.
Do you want to come to the flat?
Whoa, where did you get the money for tha?
Hi.
Okay, too late.
Looks like we have a lead on a new flat.
If it is organised with police involement they just have to wait for us to meet the undercover leaser.
Is this the USA?
It is in the place we want.
I do not like mvvm, mvp, or mvi any more.
And when you look at the "best practices" google examples, they never use any of them either.
Flutter is though.
Packing up now.
The only benifit of passing a context is that is it less concrete. That it has fewer methods in the interface than an activity.
Nah, when she tells me I will tell you.
Nope.
HOW
DO IT
Do not send my passport details.
A trap to catch us doing something illegal.
No foreigners is a rule. Also you must have a university degree.
But legally, if toka's dad signs the contract, and the owner is okay with leasing under the knowledge that me and toka are living there, it is fine. We checked with a lawyer.
Yalla, I want a new flat.
Renting these places without satisfying the rules.
And like ass the police need a warrent here.
ew
Or mvc.
And the state needs to be immutable.
You lost the streak :(
At the end of the day it really does not matter if you pass the viewmodel an activity or a context.
Conventionally, context is better too, because convention.
Yeah these dates are good.
6-16th is the only option you gave.
I still have no real names for them now.
The place has restrictions on who can live there.
In 100% of the cases when you use a view model, the context you have **is** an activity.
Yeah, but the first place told you they replaced the entire board and it was hopeless.
The second place just fixed a chip on the board.
No, the mail server became the (mail + website) server.
mailsite and newpi.
Or the hdd failure of 2009.
An ssd will eventually fail.
Everything has a risk of failure.
And back then they were known to be less reliable.
Unless it is a power surge.
I backup to hard drives.
I think at this point, if we find a place, we will rent it straight away and start moving slowly.
But today we might have found one.
Are you here.
No.
No but.
They all do not solve the problem well enough.
A better design pattern needs to keep all statefull data away from the stateless.
But the android sdk just is not designed like this.
I am here.
Are you fine?
But that does not stop the viewmodel casting to an activity because it knows it is an activity.
And in that case you are better specifying that the context must be an activity to work, instead of casting.
Any system with a "Context" is so complex it should be scraped.
A context is a shitty cop out.
Or did they lie.
If nothing goes wrong in the next 1-2 days, I will delete them.
And three seconds later realised, SHIIIIT
Anyway, get an ssd. Or store all important things on a server.
The first one 8 years ago I think.
Not found a willing leaser.
It is the same distance as currently.
They are too messy and sweet.
6th-16th.
It sounds like most people have no idea how to fix hardware.
I just turned off the old website and api server.
And have daily backups.
And after you get an ssd too.
These days, they are much much more reliable than hard drives.
I have owned 7, and none have broken.
*device
I only need the ssd for speed.
South east of work.
Oh for sure, yes.
But the case you will have to get here, obviously.
Do not update anything on the 3ds.
Where? What did they do different?
Did they really replace the board then?
Or diagnose.
Yeah, I am very aware of how data loss affects a person :D
Or lost encryption keys.
But if you only have one copy, and it does fail, because there is always a chance.
So to be comepletly safe, unplug the backup device.
But we must finish this flat in december.
Found a place I want to move to.
I have three mangos.
She wants to do HR.
And is sick of English.
No, why do you ask that?
I suppose just busy at work, then toka was home all evening.
I will get into bed.
Okay good.
The number of times I have typed rm -rf something-bad
CTRL+C CTRL+C
All being run 24/7 since the day I bought them.
The probability of two devices failing at the same time is not high.
I think all my buying is on pause until we move flat.
Yeah.
But they are too messy and sweet.
I will stay awake for another one and a half hours.
Clean n' Close.
Toka might travel this weekend.
The power just went out.
I am too jealous of all the people who see you everyday.
Happy August.
I will have breakfast.
It is super busy.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
We went food shopping and seb3a w nos shopping.
Toka still does not know.
More runny.
No but she is applying.
I am super tired tonight.
She already had jobs before English in HR.
I want good photos of us.
Did you fall.
This t-shirt is horrible. Pretend it does not exist.
I am at work.
I IS FINE
WOW WHAT
Why not tomorrow?
Oh.
I am here.
Less viscous.
Mummy will know.
Did you finish all your eggs?
Be here.
At 2am...
I never see any of them.
What have I done there?
I will fall.
It is old and wavey.
WE?
Wait, it is not parents' day tomorrow.
It is very calming seeing the server user 7GiB of ram and not having to panic.
How do I help?
Toka is here so probably not hanging out.
Thank you.
Mummy you will never guess what we just bought.
When are we going to see each other?
Maybe.
They must take you for granted.
I will check that after work.
Oh.
Packing up.
Oh it would be nice. The availability is low, so if one comes up we would be paying for two flats at once.
Yeah.
Have you seen this before?
I will have to buy twice as many next year.
Well I hope you learned the lesson.
Were is your beautiful face?
It is a bit late right now.
Hmmm.
I got hummous and hob nobs and tea.
I will sleep.
The power came on.
Any any any time you can and want to, offer it.
Am I there often?
And big.
It does match though.
You would go alone? :(
I can wait.
Oh no. One day you will escape exams.
Borrtex is just wonderful. I think they must be in my top top list now.
But she might travel this weekend, so lots of hanging out.
I am so sore and tired.
No, it is edible.
Did borrtex help?
I thought you were sleeping.
Are my messages not sending.
Today was busy and exhausting.
But not by itself.
Come in.
I am just glad you are here.
I am just glad you are here.
I got two super glues to test which is better.
But I do not know what.
Nooo I looked so much younger.
<3
Good morning.
I need to find the source of this.
Mariam really liked peaky blinders.
Hi.
I was this moment about to give up and fall.
INFINITIPRO BY CONAIR
Also you can see the thing we bought in the background.
Okay so friday at 2:30am.
But I never looked at what it is.
I miss your face and your voice and your words.
On wow.
I am quite sleepy.
I bought mounting tape, normal tape, rubber bands, and super glue.
I just feel like I could do things with them.
The battery is super low, so if I disappear.
Do I look too old.
In photos. Not because of the tape.
Leave me 200 messages about everything.
I found out it is a painting of a real thing.
Guess what we bought.
It is runny.
Goodnight mariak.
You were outside until 6am?
The umberla festival, in portugal.
If a good time to call comes up I will tell you.
Or 4am?
Less runny.
We made crisps.
You get to experience brittish airways now.
Oh.
Yeah toka is not going this weekend.
Where are you.
How are you now?
How was the exam?
My head hurts, and I am hot. But I am fine.
We can hangout tonight if you can.
Okay.
I made a bouncy toy pendulum thing for the cats.
But the cats never play with things we make or buy them.
Sorry for the creased t-shirt.
Will you send you.
Coconut oil, we got coconut oil. JEEZ
Yeah it is fine.
I get about 80gbp a month personal allowance.
Hello.
Yes.
Will you wake up.
Nope, leave it for the morning.
When we move flat we will.
Waht.
What was wrong with Hla?
Like they really hurt.
Yeah, the times are fine.
Oh taxi's from the airport are expensive.
Forward me a copy of the reservation email.
Mmmmmmm nooooodles.
Hob nobs and digestives are pretty easy to find here now.
Where did you go.
What.
You were not at the balcony.
Toka is streaming on instagram.
You are never here.
I do not even have a reason.
The heat maybe.
The last one we would drop you off at 1am or so.
And since I go to bed at 2-3am in the morning anyway, it is not a problem.
We would just pick you up, go home, and sleep.
Taxi's.
Maybe even Nada could drive us.
My sister booked her flight for the 6th of december to visit.
The shop is on the way.
Where are you?
Are you here.
I miss you so much.
Most of the time I refuse to go out twice in one day.
I did that a few times when I was young.
All my bones hurt when I sleep longer than 7 hours.
I hope we are moved by then and you get to see the new place.
I want noodles.
Are you going to meet my sister?
I am exhausted.
For about 30 minutes.
I need a better mattress and pillow.
Where did you get it from?
Did they have hummous stands?
Oh, well it thinks I am in Germany.
Will you be here at bedtime tonight?
Heat, I do not think about it, I masturbate when she is not here, she never proposes.
This has been an issue for this whole year.
I have 24 hours of overtime last month, so I get a bigger pay this month.
My mum would suggest things to do, but I did not want to do anything.
Soon I will hit my genuine 200 days streak on duolingo.
With 20 lingots.
Toka is sad because we do not have sex.
How old is Hla now?
Cutting clothes or something.
What do you have?
I like to imagine there are hummous stands in syria.
Did you ask him how the hummous availability was?
And she is on her period.
And because we are not having sex, I stop thinking about. But she is different and she starts thinking about it more.
And then when she got home, I was too tired.
Why is she up so late.
Set a better example.
But you never had an older sister to look up to. Just your bad example parents.
I think what would be best is to rewatch the  videos we took, and convert it to a mobile interface.
When I did not know what to do, I would cry.
I stayed away from it.
I am a bit sore, but I am fine.
My hands are so itchy.
I like it but it is a little not cheerful.
I told her what I think we should do, but she is on her period so she is very sad no matter what.
It will be fine.
Are you afraid I will become used to it?
Or complacent.
Well, you have to fix your sleeping before someone else will follow your lead.
To me it feels like all these medicines break you.
I need the natural Mariam.
Hormoines.
Oh is that because I said I would not call you thin or fat?
Are you bulimic.
Are you fine today?
I have hummous.
Okay take me there.
I want a huge amount of hummous. Not a side dish.
In December that happened, then we did not have sex for two months.
She does not want to propose all the time, because then she would get rejected sometimes. Which is just a reality.
She wonders why I do not get horny just looking at her. Which I think is not reality either. I get horny after sexual activity or sexual thoughts. But looking at anyone is not sexual.
Okay well it is good to hear someone else wonder that.
Not yet.
I think I will go to bed at 2am.
The mariam streak ended :(
But I just like seeing pictures of yourself so much.
I think you have never talked about something like this.
By the time I was comfortable with it again, the heat was here. But her job meant that she was always at work when I was at home. So there would be no way I could last until she got home without masturbating.
She has brought it up, three or four times since it started.
We will not get AC until the new flat.
I think I experience the heat the same as everyone else.
It is just too hot for anything that active.
I will get into bed.
I am here.
I think you are a bigger influence.
I think you are the one who has the biggest power to change that.
You make me hate medicine.
Am I too open talking about my sexual relationship.
Would you ever be this open?
Oh no. You should stop that.
I never knew this, for example.
You switched medicine and they still had the same effect?
I only trust paracetamol, ibuprofen, antihistamine, and caffeine.
Tazanidine for my muscles makes me drowsy and I do not like it.
They are called hormones.
Eww massage.
Beans, what the hell.
Oh, but will it be better than the other person who did that?
Tell the doctor to yalla beeeeeena.
I have not had any other medicines really.
Okay in my head that sounds a lot like Hermione.
Is your diet purely rye bread?
O just hate everything to do with it.
I hate their attitude, their facilities, their claims, their culture, their everything.
Do not go.
This is the only time you get all of my attention.
I wish I could see you.
Marian, because you are to complex to be defined in a dictionary.
Did you fall.
And the other relaxant made me the sickest I have ever been.
Hormones.
Everything else, sure.
I am -1000% convinced of anything massuesy.
This is the thing I choose to direct all my hate at.
Do you want to remove the makeup?
I will.
Oh did you get alone quickly.
I am too curious.
Hi.
The worst thing about the seed?
They had blackcurrant at the usual 56 though.
Actually, I am a really bad person to ask about keyboards.
We used to get this in our schools.
I often do not eat for 12+ hours.
But you got so anxious at the start.
I know I hate it more than I should. But I also do not worry about it.
No stop talking about it.
Right now, or in general?
What do you want to do?
No do not cry or sleep.
When we hangout.
But I would have to wait until toka is out at night. And use the couch.
I told her to buy as many as she could carry.
And last time I went they labelled it as 80egp, which I asked if it was right, they said no, it is 56 and so I got four.
No wait.
Oh the quality got way better.
I like faces so I think it is good.
Do you just get like this speaking to me.
But make sure you get cherry MX switches.
Are you home.
This sounds like an investigation.
Even university.
Their slogan is "Keeping up with the vegans"
Even seeing the word makes me stressed.
When will you sleep.
I think I will.
I want to fall asleep listening to a mega long mariam voice message.
Will you make one?
Just squeeze into the postbox.
WHAT WHAT WHAT
BUY 8 Oranges.
GET TWO PEACH WHAT THE FUCK
Buy as many as you can carry.
3 orange, 2 peach, 2 blackcurrant.
I was making coffee.
Why did you not sleep.
I watch a lot a lot of videos.
I am home.
Oh. I never got to see it.
Talking to me is what you want to do.
I reported you to the authorities.
He said, well I liked it, but it was not a mazen film.
And what if I make it to the end.
I think you get to long enough sometimes.
I will sleep.
Send me you in the mail. Okay.
Good morning.
Is it the same size...?
That is 50% of the price exactly.
What flavours are there?
Half price.
3 orange, 1 peach, 2 blackcurrant
WHY IS HLA INTO ASMR.
But washing only is the best.
Oh god no.
Oh I still have not finished the message.
I keep waiting for quiet moments.
If you obey your professor in this case you are corrupt.
You should have told the truth.
I feel like I could know you much better listening to messages like this often.
I already know most of the content, but hearing you say it is stronger.
Oh but why is it not a Mariam cast.
I have no sound in bed.
I have only earplugs.
Yeah you have your sisters.
Goodnight Mariak.
There is no way I can save this for a sleeping time.
I started using a new program to keep my lists.
Send a photo.
Toka just went for juice and they were 28egp for a bottle.
They were 56egp before.
There were only 3 orange at that price :(
Because I will only accept tiny good ones.
Okay.
I will pack up.
So they are not keeping up enough.
Maybe search for filco.
I am eating all the hob nobs.
Wait, not say anything about this. What is this?
The best food shop in the whole of Cairo.
But the do not have spread, or ice cream.
Custom Mechanical Switches (Cherry Blue equivalent)
This just means it is a cheap knock off.
The type I like are 40% blank keycap cherry mx blues.
I get it about once a month, so it is alright.
It is a really really weird thing for HLA to be into.
Who knows who will be waching her.
I have two mangoes left.
Called the Hum Hum Gang.
"Your choice: give me the hum, or take one in the gum."
I got into bed.
Juice and fruits are all sugar.
I am also not sweet; I am sweat.
Get proper cherry mxs.
You can not let her do it.
It could not have been the mango.
And we can have slogans.
"All fun and no play, makes you give me the hummous, NOW"
Or fruit.
I feel like you are missing everything.
My wrist started aching.
Are you fine?
Where is your face?
Why is it bad? It is never bad.
Goodnight mariak.
Wake up.
UNMAINTAINED
Yeah.
I usually just fix old projects or other people's stuff.
Gourmet Egypt.
Not including the two almost finished ones, it was 18.08GBP.
So pretty expensive.
You might like a 60% keyboard.
Hummous and juice.
No.
I think we should make a gang.
Be here.
I had some already. And lots of hob nobs.
Did hummus become your number one?
Are you not super tired.
I can believe you were so awake.
Then again. I do like you.
Get off that diet.
Okay spin faster.
Just me.
I think so.
Hi.
Oh I get to start a new project.
But better than that, a xeon e3 1245v6
And ECC ram.
I hope so much you are fine all the time.
Yeah, it is.
You would only want to eat hummous for the rest of ever?
She is too young to understand this.
"If you are out of hummous, fuck youmous"
Okay good.
I am very full now.
I feel very tired.
Oh.
How have you not tried Robinson's yet.
I do not like sweet things much.
And desserts burn.
It is too hot. I am sweaty.
Go up to 11.
They just do sometimes.
I am falling so early.
Oh I fell.
My foot to numb.
Like, "If you ain't got hummous, that ain't funmous."
What did you say at the end of the message.
When you said try not to talk about this to the doctor.
Quick distract me.
Only occasionally do I have fruit juice.
It limits sweet things.
Are you my fan?
babaghanoush...?
Because people used the think speakers that went to 11 were louder than 10.
What are you waxing?
What is this.
Which will be my second only project here.
OMG THANKS
I think you can get a less powerful GPU by far.
And how are you failing?
I have seen this.
That is the property (on, off) called?
I think too expensive for the parts.
Did you find these parts, or was it assembled?
I do actually want you to visit my house when toka is away and we design a computer.
Just weekdays I am exhausted, and last weekend she was home, and periody.
About what?
My grandmother dying is something that makes me sad, but I do not think about it all the time.
And all the time I am not sad.
I am worried.
Yeah, wait until you are married :D
When I go to a light switch, and I turn it on.
And it can be on, and off.
State describes all properties.
operativity maybe.
I now have to worry about whether anything happened.
This is the friend that has no associations other than hash.
And I do not like it when I am with someone and they are on a call, so I live by that standard.
Some earl grey tea.
When do you have to wake up?
I had hummous.
Did you run it under cold water for minutes straight after the burn?
I am fine.
Are you?
Get an i7.
The ssd is probably the most important part these days.
Collected them?
Build it yourself.
Stop feeling bad for yourself.
I know when you are sad.
What are you doing?
What film is it?
In English.
The state of the switch is "on fire"
State describes everything about something that can be mutated.
Just wait until we can do it in person.
And all I can think is "get out my house" over and over.
I already did say all this to her.
He is still here.
Mariam.
Will you be here at bedtime?
What are you nervous about.
Hmmmmmmm.
It is modern, but anything without an ssd is not worth buying.
Cut out that middle man.
What no.
I love you.
I live with you.
Just because you have things to be sad about, and are sad sometimes, does not make you sad all the time.
Are you fine.
Probably for the best.
Have you?
What did I change?
*what
Like a car.
But the state is, (off, 0m/s).
The laura marling song is playing.
I complained to toka about it.
She can not prove her trust back.
I should not have to think about this.
And her face looks droopy.
I am so annoyed.
They spent most of the time on the balcony.
Or even use the intel integrated for now.
And get an ssd.
All that matters is your happiness. If you are happy you succeed.
And you are not sad the majority of the time.
Today is a work day.
I need English help.
If I change something from (off,false,0) to (on,true,1) what am I changing?
State is too general.
If you change the speed, sure.If you turn the car on, what are you changing?
Into a state of non-operation; into a state of non-existence.    Please switch off the light when you leave.     die off 
I came home to toka's mae friend in the house.
I saw it, but I need the phone.
He is still not gone.
Also, toka does not get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to being alone with people in the house.
My mind actually considered what I would do if something did happen.
They are too high to be people.
I do not want to be distracted, I want it to end.
I just had some tea.
You can prevent it from swelling by getting to water really really quickly.
And they only make ghanoug.
In this case I have a thing, that has many properties.
A car can have a speed.
I will pack up.
She has it on repeat...
Be here.
I am nothing but stressed and angry when someone is in my home.
That is a trust that is never recovered.
She never asked me, she never warned me, and she told me he was leaving soon 2.5 hours ago.
I think he has no skills or interests.
And a really annoying laugh.
And I do not want her to think I am busy and distracted so not affected.
Did you dip it in hummous?
This does not help with the swelling, but if clean up with your mouth it tastes good.
Here it is babaghanoug.
Where are you.
And I never open them.
Oh.
I am too tired.
They left a bit after I last talked.
I am fine.
Oh, that must mean it is time to record a 6 hour message.
Is it crazy that you have known me 25% of your life?
I just wish it was more.
There needs to be a company called Baba.
Father Ganoog.
I shut the windows about 10-20 times a day because I hate the noise.
That looks no different to someone putting a cat next to many peaches.
I really hate outside.
Hi.
Oh, I never knew they were still in the building.
I could teach you, but from the very fundementals.
Willpower.
What really motivates someone is working on code that they have a use for.
You should not trust programmers here.
They are very badly trained.
I only heard it called this in videos.
babaghanoush.
But I discovered it here.
And now nobody would know what the joke is.
I will get into bed.
I am too negative.
I fell.
I will have to sleep.
What are you in need of?
Which makes them cryptic.
And this makes for a terrible programmer.
Because even with a university degree, everyone I have met is still missing basics and bad at programming.
I think they will be ineffective and expensive.
Or maybe you would want to make an android application first, and then go back to the basics.
We could have different subjects.
I know a way to use a colaborative environment too.
And then found out other places know it and call it noush.
I found it odd.
And they sell it as Baba's Ghanoug.
I miss the mariam streak.
You have a class in an hour.
Will you sleep when you get home?
I am not sure they are complicated. They just do not know how to deal with various emotions, or how to express them well yet.
It is a tall wall to get over at first.
Oh no.
All noise.
Are you positive? Because I feel a spark between us.
I kept falling asleep and waking up with the phone on me.
Why does she wake you.
It is very rude to wake someone.
Well yes, but also courses suck.
We could make it an hour a day, without distractions.
They will start with a language that hides fundementals.
The basics are needed to understand why things happen, and to make better decisions about what you should write.
Navigation only occurs between views.
Are you here.
And now  am very tired.
In need of coffee.
They skip the base.
Because the two are only losely connected.
:(
Do you want to go back to university?
Come on come on give me a chance.
I got 6000 today, and aparrently 1000 next week.
Packing up.
Skip to 2-3 minutes for the true start.
I do miss it though.
Hey!
Is it the weekend yet.
The question is not well formed.
Are you sleeping?
Hunnnngry.
Hi.
Hi.
That pill is strong.
That is what I feel.
I am ready for hash if you want to buy it now.
WHEN WILL YOU GET SOME
Yeah.
I am home.
I hate them 1000x more they have a dog now.
I can not stand these shitstain humans.
Is it home time yet.
But this time you are not bleeding.
Do you not sing to hla often?
My main problem with the guitar hero guitar, is my finger sliding over those bumps.
I took a muscle relaxant.
I heard the delta message.
Where was this?
I am sad.
An;
You slept.
Wake up.
After tomorrow.
My neck hurt.
It is the same effect.
I doubt you will be back.
When will you be home?
I hate people with dogs so much.
Do you think I have forgotten about the
# Red Dress
I wish many things I can not say.
When will we meet.
AC.
My watch needs fixing.
When will you sleep?
Wow, rude.
Dry eyes, dry mouth, drowsy.
They have locked the dog out.
And it is scraping and barking.
I hope they burn for eternity.
Your job does not have to be important to you.
University made me feel bad about myself too.
But eventually it ended and I was happy again.
I wish I were in a silent, cool place for a long time where I could just sleep and be bored.
Hmmm.
I do not like how you do not know exactly how things happen and why between me and toka.
What will you do tonight?
Just a tiny hole.
Otherwise it will pop when you do not expect it and are not prepared.
Can I see.
Maybe.
What will yo check?
Oh, the time.
I really hope we move away from these neighbours soon.
And when I unloaded on him, he put the dog outside as a gesture.
I can not think about it.
How are you?
Everyone was so much better than me.
Will you bring white thick bread?
It is when I am alone and bored for a week when I start changing and doing things.
This is far
y
People lock dogs out and ignore them and they bark.
Will you send you?
Why?
You being here is super important to me, and it makes me happy when you are.
Without anyone.
I need bread and hummous.
Is it not tomorrow?
Or maybe you went into every shop and they all had golden things but to keep it a surprise you said they had none.
But I also think it is impossible for you to know without being me.
It is not even something I would like to talk about.
I was waiting for you last night.
Oh my god.
Stretching the skin and breaking it.
Dip the needle in ethanol and burn it off before sticking it in your skin.
And do it from the side.
Just to know if it is an option.
I am struggling to wait for the bread.
What does it look like now.
Otherwise the students would not be there.
There are many jobs in Cairo. I think you should worry about that after you finish education.
Where are you?
Worry after two years from now.
Breadbereadbeard.
** If you get noodles too.
It is consuming your finger.
You should really pop it.
But use a tiny needle, and drain it slowly.
In case it forces through too much you do not want it perpendicular to your finger.
If you want to be super safe, after it, use antiseptic and cover it.
Tomorrow is our anniversary.
I ate hummous.
Toka went to some part.
My stomach is really sore.
How is your finger?
I drank way way too much.
Did you fall back asleep?
A holiday once a year is normal.
But it is important to other people.
Please be happy.
Money and jobs are for after education.
Maybe.
I hope bread comes soon so I can eat hummous.
Did you see this game before?
Thursday is parents, and I will tell you if friday is available.
Yeah, they did.
The size of a pan each.
I am joking.
Nice to meet you sleepy.
Is your mum not too ill for that?
Sorry.
I will play it tomorrow.
Special brownies, right, right?
I am so hungry.
Pop that with a clean needle already.
You want your hands to be clean when it pops.
Actually, if she goes out on a thursday evening, would you be fine with the evening?
Are you alive.
Eating hummous.
Toka made scones.
She made two giant ones.
And I think you went to some bed.
Are you sleepy?
Why do you guys take so many holidays.
It is busy, but I am not stressed by it.
Did you get something to eat?
I downloaded a game called dead cells.
I wish tomorrow was the weekend.
I downloaded it last night.
I want to change our room color.
I made it red.
Too many people were blue.
I am here.
It is too often.
But I am not your family.
I do not get it.
How long will you be gone for?
Will you start the Mariam streak again?
What about my mum and dad.
It is our annivesary today.
We took some photos in the morning.
I am not sure how my belly can fit so much tonight.
I find holidays more stressful.
Because I am not at home.
And the sun.
And salt
And tourists.
Work does not stress me out.
Why am I awake.
Wake up.
Yalagogog.
We have never travelled though.
But we are not a family.
Will you stay here, though?
Hi.
Are you there now?
Familiar because you played it this week?
Dangeriam.
A mail server disaster happened.
Did you start going?
There was a spammy client and now we have a mail server disaster.
Yeah, but remind me later to talk about that.
Email emergency at work.
Shit, I have no option.
Oh no.
I am getting close to being able to leave.
Are you relaxing yet?
It is nice.
full.
And like I need to hardcore relax.
Banoorik.
I saw the bottom photo and hahahaha that did not look like a thumb.
I am not sure how a video could tell you much.
Periods.
Shhhhhhhh
Oh our hugs.
They last so short.
I will sleep.
That was a crazy day.
Okay weekend time.
Did they leave you to sleep?
I took it but I never saw it.
Paul just go to bed or watch harry potter!
It is not good enough to substitute anything.
This is you being moody if I were Hla.
This is way too funny for me.
Crazy is watching me play chess puzzles.
What options do you have?
:D
Yeah.
How did you spend the first day?
I need to have hummous.
Well I do not partake in social media because it is too shitty or fake.
Then a bride for van winkle
You can miss me instead.
It is a better feeling of miss.
I would not want to go anywhere today.
I will experience the pain no matter what.
Packing up.
Just you wait until we get our place.
I did.
Is it expensive.
I will get into bed.
Will you be here?
Hello, and mar7abn to our chat.
Maybe if I lived with you.
This is a joke. It is not a case study.
I want to hug you without needing to end it.
Goodnight Mariak.
I am here.
Toka.
Where is my hairdryer?
I was playing dead cells.
Ehlan w sehlan ya mariam.
There are many hours in a day.
Because I would be annoying you and you would want me to be quiet and watch, or sleep.
When you ask for them.
;)
This is what I do at night when I wait for your reply.
It will stress me out.
Miss Paul.
I am sleepy.
I have too much stress.
This has nothing to do with your parents.
When I am in pain, I want to be at home. Not anywhere else.
This is not unusual behaviour.
I do not want to go because it is not home.
I feel like shit.
Is it unlimited.
Then watch your usage.
I said I did not want to go to he parent's because the amount of pain I am in.
And all I get is a dissapointed and mad toka.
But I know, a loud TV, and a loud conversation is too much for my head today.
And I know it will happen.
heat
I go to work 5/7 days.
This is not home all the time.
Give me time to rest.
Toka.
Sure I will come out and get lung cancer with your friends.
And a different day saying you are not good enough for me.
Stop telling me that you can't do things.
And do not, for the love of god, get dissapointed and mad at me when they do not make us both happy.
It does not seem fair at all.
But saying it does not matter where you experience the pain is nonsense.
Why are you trying to say I do not want to go because of your parents?
Stop making me feel like shit, for not wanting to feel shittier.
I need rest.
One week was balls hot.
The next you were bleeding.
Work, toka.
It takes the days away.
One of the first things we did was you invited me out with them.
And it was a horrible mistake.
Toka.
This seems to be said as if it is not applicable both ways.
The fact that it is your parents, means it comes with the implication that I must go.
This has nothing to do with them.
It invoves going outside, in the hat, and being away from home for half a day.
And being outside makes me feel shiitier.
If I spent a whole week inside without work, sure, claim I am indoors too much and we can go places.
No problem.
twice
Poka time does not equal toka time.
Make propositions of actions that make us both happy.
Do you really hate me this much?
It is not a balanced input in your head.
A bit.
But other things too.
You need to start observing what makes me happy and what does not.
This was your idea of fun.
Stop telling me I am not good enough for you one day.
I feel like you would be happier with an android without their own will.
Even later still.
This is what I get a lot.
It is a text file.
A copy of the conversation.
You should read it.
Any time I have an input on any action that affects us both, you get angry that I have an input, and you make me sad.
I have too much stress :(
The cats are fine.
My back and neck, and head.
I was sore.
But I am not that sleepy.
I am fell fed and drinked.
I finished all the hummous.
This looks like a onesie.
But they do, and I hate them.
I am having trouble with toka.
But at least you are here.
I got into bed.
I feel like you are missing them.
But I am only 20%ish done.
Do not pull the string when you see it.
Why.
I hate everyone with dogs.
If dogs could not bark, fine.
And nobody can look after a husky.
They require too much exercise.
How are you?
Are you sleepy?
Why are you lonely?
Why are you gone.
Not really.
Where did you go.
It was just to give you an idea of what people do not see.
It is long.
A text editor.
YOu can use your pc to read it.
Hi.
I am here.
And sad.
Not tomorrow.
I am too used to you with glasses now.
Goodnight Mariak.
I will leave it for now.
I am.
I slept from about 2 to 7.
Also, never take a dog near me :(
I will get into bed very soon.
Sore, as usual.
Where are all the photos?
I figured this.
I will wait until toka wakes up so the sound does not wake her.
What is going on.
Oh, it is a past photo.
My head hurts a bit.
I started making a graph of the servers.
Toka went to a party.
So I am just watching videos and drinking juice.
Lisa does not look much different.
I want food, but the just is not any.
How are you?
Where are you?
Down where?
The kitchen...?
Thee, thee?
You look so happy you might be crazy.
there
It got bigger.
I will shower because my skin feels like sweat.
Yeah.
I am super clean.
Are you having a fine time so far?
Toka will not come home tonight.
And then she is going away for a couple of days.
So I think it is a goodbye holiday.
Both Ginger and Crazy are on the mousepad.
Anything.
Also, bitengen.
I will do you a deal.
And I will try to cook them differently each time.
My stomach these days is getting really sore when I get hungry.
I love the smell onions leave on my fingers.
Are you having it on the street?
Are you always a prisoner?
Can we get raw fool beans?
Why.
If you keep the vegetable panty well stocked, I will cook them.
The new tester just gave us two chocolates.
Love you.
Uh oh.
My ear is stuck popped.
It is not, but it feels it.
But it is readily available, and would be delivered to me.
Yeah, a week.
But I told him I would just get 1kg from the shop for 130, and it is better at the shop.
I have peed more than 15 times today.
Also, you look almost like a different person.
This is correct.
Asian places are usually allright.
What did you eat?
I want to try making fool myself.
I want some, also I want to try making fool.
Oh.
I had ice cubes.
I am, but work is so soon.
One of her friends is leaving egypt.
Ginger AND Crazy are on the mousepad.
Come back.
I should really go to bed.
The muscle relaxant makes my stomach hurt a lot.
I think mainly vegetables.
I am not going to refuse a gift, it makes me look arrogant.
But my poop is pretty healthy.
6 medium ones.
Oh hello.
Ginger's hair is so much softer than crazy's.
They just never get their face hair cut.
I think I will.
Also, I want to cook everyday.
Could you make sure they are not foosty?
And tomatoes.
I have no idea.
# THE HOLE
As soon as I shut my eyes, I imagine someone is above me waiting for my eyes to open.
Yeah.
Hummous only keeps a couple of days.
Your previous photos of it were great so no wonder they want you.
Is it up to Aya standards?
Did you dip the chips in the soup?
It got too big for pngs.
Where did you go?
Are you staying in a place by yourself?
Yes.
My throat hurts a lot.
I feel ill today.
I want to make mashed carrots today.
Yes.
It looks so fancy but tastes like really cheap chocolate.
Cause I fell in the hole, **the hole,
I could never fall asleep in public.
I am thinking 1kg a week.
Well at first he said 200 because he is sales.
The plane.
I am not sure yet.
Did anyone rob you?
It is not perfect.
He said 90, but I told him to ask his mum.
Oh, amr's mum can make good hummous.
So I am negotiating a trade contract.
I am playing dead cells.
4 tomatoes, 1 white onion, 6 medium carrots, 1 medium bitengen, 2 kosas, 2 cucumbers.
No.
Are you home?
I am.
What are you doing?
Oh, I thought you would fly out with them.
Did you like this playlist.
I will pack up in a moment.
Okay packing up.
My throat hurts so much.
I think I found a hummous supplier.
I am making a deal.
Amr's mum.
Good enough.
Why are you working on holiday.
I will get into bed.
When will I have a 300 day streak.
I am falling.
Lamps.
Marian surrounded by 30 lamps.
Mmmmmmmm
As a falling person, yes.
But the dictionary has Marian and not Mariam.
I keep microsleeping.
My throat is terrible.
Wake up.
I mentioned at breakfast that you started learning python.
And magdy said, "Tell her to come be an intern here".
Folk duets really get to me.
Come in.
Toka is going away for 3 days tonight.
Toka's trip was cancelled.
Be here.
I was looking forward to some alone time.
Yeah.
Yeah I want those shoes.
It is pretty empty.
Pick a charity that gives cheap cures to fatal diseases.
It is often that 1-3gbp can stop someone dying.
Pretty sure they were empty.
Can you find my hairdryer?
Toka wants one and I left mine over there.
There are hairdryers that create cold air.
I am packing up.
What happened to your internet?
Does he have unlimited?
Hi.
Anything you think might be mine, put it to the side and ask me.
Pretty sure I got rid of most the stuff I did not want already though.
The old haloween stuff.
Yeah, compared to most people.
Why?
My one was not cheap though.
Does it make cold air?
I am home.
One of the people going had to go to the hospital.
I am going to take the three storage drives from the server when lisa comes.
I want all my clothes.
Lisa's.
Breast cancer charities often have stupidly low efficiencies. They often have 30% or more of their revenue spent on advertising.
Pick a better charity.
Unless these are just bags.
And there are charities that are over 95% effective with the money.
I am home.
She will use the cold mode.
My throat hurts too much and I am too tired.
Everything...?
Anything DS is lisa's.
There are a few boxes.
Because I already have one.
We do have one in the amazon basket with a cold setting
Hello Miss Woke.
Both cool.
I have grapes and hummous.
The giant snake.
So then the server can be turned off.
But also a blue one.
I think she can play them on the 3ds actually.
Oh, they are a bit big to take out.
Does mine not have it?
Okay, so not cold?
She wants it mainly for the diffuser.
It would be with those two monitors.
My computer, or yours?
Plug it into the computer directly.
[73377.729123] usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -71[73401.996951] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 78 using xhci_hcd[73402.125085] usb 1-1: Device not responding to setup address.[73402.333126] usb 1-1: Device not responding to setup address.[73402.540953] usb 1-1: device not accepting address 78, error -71
25Kg in total.
She hates heat on her hair.
Can you get lisa to check?
Well, you will have to check now, because if it does not we might buy a new one.
Reviews.
I can send you the link to the one we picked, it is only 25gbp I think.
Baby.
It is saved on the amazon account at home, so when I get home.
Well this is too long.
You do not have an sd card reader...
Reboot
Oh god I am so hungry.
I think I am fine.
I am home.
Cold, or air temperature?
Yeah that.
What will you do?
Not for her current hairdryer :D
Oh yeah.
in
What are we making today.
I was doing work for Magdy.
For doing unpaid labour?
Which other room?
Check them out on amazon.
But yeah, her current one is terrible.
What?
Yeah, the usb device is not recognised.
Usb
pc
Use a different port.
We have been over this, the monitors are a joke.
Okay you should move out now.
Of the house.
I got more hummous.
Trivial persuit is up there.
Well that is why I ordered 5kg of styrofoam.
Roast vegetables?
Packing up.
Why were you shouting?
Are you trying to stay away from Hla?
Maybe. What do they look like?
We really need to meet.
I usually run out in the week of toe socks.
To take with lisa.
I am fine.
Have you started university again?
Yeah, clothes would be too much.
Mariam <3
Who will you go with?
Because toka wants to go somewhere with me.
Where will you stay?
def get_work(mass, acceleration, distance):get_force(mass, acceleration) * distance # This value is not saved, or returnedreturn # This function does not return the value of work
Command...?
Yeah, I just do not know what they are defining as a command.
Any intact toe socks would be good.
I will have to order more.
I have plenty for in the house.
Toka was meant to go away for 3 days, but something happend to one of her friends.
It was meant to be easier to meet me while you were going to university.
This makes me very happy.
I feel like I have a giant deep spot on my face.
What is it?
Like this.
The top version we have *inlined* the work variable.
I have 5 pairs, and we do washing once a week.
I am here.
Why are you sad.
Because I went to bed early?
I tried to pop it but just blood.
**c**hange **d**irectory
I fell in the hole.
Because of your dad and the room?
I have no bread :(
I have no mariam :(
I feel naked without the headphones on my head.
Both of these are fine.
It is version control.
# THE HOLE 
pacman -Syu --force
An honour is already really high.
Packing up.
I have not been told what days it will be yet.
I hope it starts soon.
I love you too.
Come in and be here all day.
A nested function.
Yeah, I send the clues.
You can look at the get_force function to see the correct syntax.
unix-like
Amr not being here, everyone had breakfast.
Are you fine?
I will pack up in a moment.
Not enough context.
Can you wake up.
I am here.
A whole python program, probably.
You must have know ls and cd before though, right?
Git is the most useful program.
It is like saving your work.
**the hole**
The north coast is preferrable.
Yeah, honour is already a specialised word.
Okay.
I think because it is 360 horizontal, but not fully 360 vertical.
I have hummmmous.
Hla will move into your room?
I am waiting for you to send you.
It is fine.
I would never know that if it happened.
**l**i**s**t
Oh that is not being here all day.
Aparrently.
Putting great before it does not change it much.
I feel so happy about us.
It is like this, right?
Stabalized 360 video.
Yeah, the gopro fusion.
Oh, I suppose you could rent out a planetarium, they have 360 projectors.
I wonder if we will get 360 cinemas.
I would rather see a film alone, though.
Nope.
I will make some tea.
Hla's?
Never been.
I want us to always become closer and never drift apart.
Will you stay up all night?
Oh, toka went out.
I think it is better than you moving out of your room.
Did you watch any more films?
I am fine.
It is no one.
But not everything.
It sounds like a christmas song.
What do you want me to do?
I wish I could stay and also be in a comfortable bed.
I got into bed.
The only way to watch a 360 video without distortion is on a globe though, and you can not see all sides of a globe at the same time.
I will have date things.
WHO YOU CALLING A HOE
But did you listen to the playlist yet?
No.
Some thoughts are better left inside.
I think you would not tell me many things you think.
I tell toka more about things that happen in the day.
Then again, I only talk to my family and you and toka.
Did you sleep?
And you are too far and it is dark outside.
I am so sleepy.
Yes.
I am at work.
Are you rested now?
# HEY
What did you say about the two big date round things?
Okay, I will pick you up at 2am.
Also come in.
I tell you a lot.
It is hard to compare between here and real life.
What do you do all night?
I am not sleepy yet.
To panic less.
I do not have the phone.
I am watching game videos.
You can cover with the red dress.
Oh are they still Nada's teacher?
Mariam date things.
No, I just want to lift you.
But, also yes.
Oh that took way forever.
Of course I want to see.
They are songs with lyrics that make me want to sing them.
I never knew you wanted to show me.
But I think I tell you out of anyone more about how I feel.
I am still watching videos and drinking juice.
I only have it when she sleeps.
It would make me excited it get out of bed to check.
If you make a deal.
I will sleep if you what?
Or maybe metro.
Well, you know which one.
Okay, I will keep wanting.
These memories are falling too far behind.
When you were young?
Although, I should be.
What do you want me to do?
What are you diong?
How has the playlist not finished yet.
Exhausted?
And if your are up all night it would make sense there are many things I missed.
I am off monday, tuesday, wednesday.
Yeah, I wish my work was next door.
I love you <3
I feel like my legs are healthy but the rest of me is not.
It is annoying.
At what time?
You can just talk.
Not really.
I wish I woke up to more things from you.
Wow, hello.
Are you fine?
Will we go to the market to look for vegetables?
How much are they?
I still cycle every day.
Yeah.
There are not many nice places here, but we could sit outside somewhere.
But it is wednesday, so maybe later.
What is it called?
Tahrir square is too busy.
Hi.
I am half asleep.
I woke up.
Pretty tired.
Oh yes.
You would be a machine.
Tell me nearer the time.
About 6:10.
Actually, i think I rememeber toka checking this site a few weeks ago.
Oh dear.
Mac was too terrible for me.
I replaced the hdd in this pc with my 7 year old ssd, and it feels 2-3 times faster.
But it is wednesday :D
I really need a break.
Or not next door because it would be too loud, but next building.
You travel so far though.
I could recommend it but she is out of work right now.
So she does not take any taxis anymore.
Sounds typical.
Yeah, this was me last night.
I am making my first single-activity application :D
I only buy food.
Are you here?
Did you get it?
But I also have too much overtime, so it does not matter.
You are just at your current company, waiting for them to pay you?
Yeah.
Terminals took 10 seconds to load, which was unacceptable.
And trying to install anything was a pain in the ass.
Did you wake up *at* work?
Are you home yet?
No ali breakfast.
Monday is the day I get off.
Yeah, no, that is too much.
Hi Mariam.
Okay.
gradutation
typo
Yeah, I saw the paragliding one.
I am off on monday, tuesday and wednesday.
When we went last it was 600 for a 4/5 bedroom flat.
Toka is not keen on going though.
Are you Mariam?
How are you?
I think it might edit it out automatically.
I am home too.
No, did you get the details?
Is it for her skin?
I wish I had more food though.
Did you sleep.
Soooooon.
Are you here?
Your parents just rung.
What are you talking about?
My photos look terrible.
I am okay.
Wake up.
I feel like I missed you today.
I woke up.
When did you get up.
Jesus
The event log?
This first one reminds me a lot of the second one.
How do you think you look too ugly for me but not for university.
It is the weekend.
I used Koin in a new project instead of dagger.
And I liked it quite a bit better.
My head hurts and I need coffee.
You never look ugly to me.
These flaws are not important.
Should I have a higher standard of Mariam in my head than what Mariam is?
Where are you.
Am I too far?
Where are you going out to?
Wait, let me ask toka.
"Amer cafe" aparrently.
Could you write an addressish for Amr?
Yeah I saw this.
Will you send you?
I am home.
I am the home man.
Will you get blueberries.
I wish I had some now.
Ruuude.
Did you set her desk on fire?
I am fine.
Amer, it's in triumph square next to a big electronics store.
Triumph square? is that beside triumph hotel?
She has not replied.
Are you bringing food?
She came back at midnight.
Did you tell her about me yet.
Oh so you might get it tomorrow?
What was the name of the place we used to go to buy coffee?
Amer or Abo Amer?
She is outside.
Triumph square, Masr Elgedida.
Hi.
No, not unless it is late.
Toka fell asleep with the phone in her hand.
Why are you?
I do too.
I think you look the same in real life though.
Get GWS pumpkin seeds.
And if you do not like blueberries, I feel bad for you son.
Okay phew.
Near Heliopolis.
I miss your face.
What are you doing?
No, the two most popular flavours in the uk are orange, and blackcurrant and apple.
It was like stealing gold from a sleeping dragon.
Warm, or sweaty?
I have not seen you in so long, I am wondering if you are real.
I have been home all day.
If you like pumpkin seeds.
Oh wow.
She is on the bottom of my list now.
Are you sleepy at all?
I am going to make some juice.
I was playing dead cells.
But now it is full Mariam time.
Did you get anything at Ikea?
I will get into bed because it is softer.
Did the therapist bother you?
My ear hurts.
No no no, tell me a bedtime story.
Also a lot of trampolining
And I was more active in general.
Okay yalla.
I am not that sleepy.
I can not wait until onsie weather.
I usually always play chess while I speak to you.
But not right now.
I am chessed up.
It is. They should make laundry scented candles.
I feel like I exercise and eat modest and healthy. But I feel fat.
But I also used to eat way more.
What.
My mum and sister did it too.
And also jujitsu.
Jesus.
But she is sleeping.
Tomorrow is toka's parents' day.
Blackcurrant and apple.
The only time I want a warm hug is the winter.
I never get this many right.
Do you like the smell of make up?
Import furniture.
Kick boxing everyday.
I did it for 4 or 5 years.
I feel 2026.
What did we explore?
It is too loud here.
Send it every hour.
In real life when you spend time with someone you know all the time is dedicated to the other person.
Yes <3
I do not know. My whole head hurts really.
I can not believe you live next to a place called Narges.
Maybe I only have leg muscles left.
It was when I was 20.
Am I 26?
Anyway, SIX YEARS.
I read dream last.
Wake up.
I will go to bed at the exact time 8 hours before the start of astronomical twilight in the morning.
When it starts to get bright.
The dark grey one too.
We hung out on video chat so much.
Come back.
Yeah.
I stopped before I met you.
I think you slept.
I am going to switch my sleeping.
I really need a break.
Toka.
Phew you are here.
I wear it a lot these days.
I am escaping to here.
These times are so memorable too.
It is like the giant hole types but not a hole.
This is only proof you have half a head of hair.
You look awake and nice.
I am so sleepy.
I can not wait to be home.
And she wants me to be "romantic" and buy her a gold ring.
What year did we meet?
Hmm.
I think I was 20 or 21.
Come hug already.
Come in already.
Yes.
Mashi.
Are you here.
I woke up at midday.
I think when I hungout with Maha I also got this time.
Her mum did not care though.
We would hangout all night.
To even out pay differences because of gender, and to give social insurance when the other is out of work.
Come in :(
I would never sleep with my grandparents.
My alarm is set for 3:58.
I wish we had more time like this.
Look at your wonderful face hiding.
I am so annoyed at toka today.
We have a system where our income goes into a common pool, and gets split evenly.
Do not fall asleep on the toilet.
Come back.
Are you not home yet?
I am here.
Okay.
Welcome to the front.
Will you send you again?
Is she playing mariaketball?
I am so tired.
But I think there is none.
She came home.
Will you send you?
On a message.
If I had the money to waste on a gold ring, I would buy AC, or a water filter.
And left this morning.
Toka is now out of work.
I am really sad today.
I just need to know if you are safe.
Okay.
Are you back.
Your legs will go numb.
Where are you.
Is hla trying to crush your head?
It kind of looks like a movie cover pose.
Were you standing too much?
At about 12.
Yes.
Aaanswer.
Hello?
You can even disappear mid sentence.
Are you here?
It is driving you crazy.
Oh I want to be the judge.
Did you reply to the message?
My shoulder just hurt.
Amr's mum will not make me hummous regularly :(
I thought about it.
I do not know.
She does not want to work.
I am dissapointed.
I need coofee so much.
Where are you?
Why did she call twice, and so much.
Will we still hangout?
No, but you are my star.
It looks really good.
I am at work.
So now you are my only hope.
I get three days off work this week.
I want to try making hummous again.
I came home a bit early.
I also might not go tomorrow.
There is no coffee.
I will hope there is coffee at work.
Okay you have to make me some.
Click the three dots and click reply.
No quick ones anyway.
Just to equalize out my work hours.
Hello
# Mariam
I get worried when anyone says just my name.
Does she like youssef?
And if I get back later, I have forgotten why it ended.
I think I put too much garlic in.
It always tastes too much of one thing.
Will you make a cooking show for me?
Was it Enter the Void?
How was Aya?
I played dead-cells, I watched videos.
Do I have to live in constant pain?
I feel bored today.
I will get ready for work.
> <@mariam:lost.host> There is no reply option.There is if you update.
I really like this song.
Not really.
Oh, you made me worried by just saying my name.
Going back after breaking up seems crazy to me.
I can not believe it is only half six.
I am just imagining you with your own cook show.
I am fine.
I am getting sleepy.
But I came up with no ideas.
Are fine and there?
:bluehe
Usually something big comes next.
And never like hummous as a whole.
It never got past the pilot episode.
When will you be back.
I am huuunnngry.
A bit hungry.
I do not know what to do today.
You could wake up at sunrise instead.
Are you becoming me?
I feel like I am always sore.
For me to break it has to be very bad.
So if I make it good once, I can reproduce it exactly.
Yeah.
Finally.
Yeah I was wondering.
7am was too early for me to be there.
With the, "If I can not spend it unconditionally, I do not want it at all" attitude.
You would have to tell your parents.
But it changes every day.
This is the reason my ribs hurt in the morning.
What is the plan for the rest of your day?
Did you tell her to cheer up?
Did she not try your hummous yet?
Oh wow.
No, do not say that.
I want to try making hummous again.
Maybe I will do it exact.
And measure to the gram and the minute.
It is the 24 hours waiting on beans that is annoying.
They do blend much better.
What is hard base?
Give me an example.
I had two tomatoes.
Are you taking your phone or your grandpa to the doctor?
Ah yes okay.
When she is not looking.
I am here.
So no one can join.
Are you fine.
Good morning.
Jesus.
Where did you watch that?
I am sad today.
I wish I had a few weeks alone.
I plan to switch my sleeping tonight.
To feel more awake while I am awake.
And when the sun goes down, my body starts preparing for night time things, but I am still awake.
He should have hearing aids.
But I do not want to go shopping when she is in this mood.
This just made her even more mad.
It never arrived so I thought it was big.
My sister changed her plan to come alone.
Did you hear this yet.
I really hope it does not reduce the amount we can talk.
So they do not try to ruin it for you.
And waking up at about 4am.
They told the rite brothers they could not fly.
You must need more by now.
Also, meet me today.
This morning.
I tried talking again.
I had given her a pc, a bicycle, a chair, a keyboard, a mouse, headphones, a phone.
I will think about getting her small gifts, but she does not buy gold or titanium or diamonds.
We went to just wok for a small bit of food.
Toka went out.
I hope you were good and slept.
Whatever that is.
And had kiwi.
Toka is still being annoying and grumpy.
She is also refusing to take her share of the income.
To start waking up when the sun does.
And say it is to be healthier.
These days you will have to be in bed at about 9pm.
To make sure my circadian clock is functioning at the write times.
So my body is waking up while I am still asleep.
*wright
I am born with the write of passage throughout Europe.
Okay yalla and tell your mum you are going to city stars to browse and get away from the noise.
She already escaped the noise.
I went through to lay with her for 10 minutes, but she said nothing.
And hungry.
Because her mood determines my mood.
I noticed she transfered all her money to me, which is what started it.
Things keep getting worse.
I listed all the gifts I have given her, and then listed the things she has gifted me.
Her replies are always, silence, "I don't care", "Whatever you say".
Which is about 5:30.
When light starts to appear, your clock roughly syncs the morning cycles with that.
I right too fast, that is the problem.
I ran out of things to do.
It was a long conversation.
But that was the end deal.
I got chickpeas, and tahina, and lemon and nice olive oil.
It is an hour and a half past my bedtime but we just got home.
I was waiting for the alarm but it did not wor.k
I did say they are small.
Toka is just laying in bed on her phone.
I have no idea what to do.
I am too bored.
And she had given me nothing.
I had shang tong.
And then went to panda.
How do I emergency alert you to be here.
Yalla be here.
It is not in stock currently, it was when we found it.
If it gets to close I will find an alternative.
I think it was 30gbp.
I made hummous.
We are going to get cat food.
Where are you.
Hi Hrrr.
I made a log.
A hummous diary.
You missed the lemon.
No.
I will sleep at 11pm today and wake up at 6am.
I hope you were good and slept.
I woke up.
I have coffee and ven. foulia.
I had grape juice.

I made a deal.
I did.
How did you know.
Toka left the phone for me so I can talk in bed.
So you should be here please.
You got the 2 cup one?
When did you sleep?
Giner and crazy slept at my head all night.
Ginger woke up with me and is still on me.
We have plenty of food now.
I will try to not use artificial lights in the house too.
Oh wow, I had a dream I was setting up outbound spam prevention.
W enta tayeb, ya kareeem.
It was nice.
Oh, tables do not render here.
Yeah, this is what I did.
I will have some more now.
Where were you all day.
When did you sleep?
10pm.
I hope you did not sleep in the day too.
Well this is no good.
I struggled to fall asleep.
And the sleep was not that good.
But I did stay in bed the whole time trying to sleep.
Yeah, I am still shifting.
I am wonder if I should get up at twilight or sunrise.
# I am wonder
Also, I am tired.
# You are ful
# Together we are WONDERFUL
Hi.
We did a circuit training exercise and now we can not move our muscles.
I hope you are super fine.
But I fell asleep easily.
Maybe that makes sense, but I do not want you to be worried.
How do you have old unsent pictures.
Fiiiine, you can take new photos.
I currently am.
I will write Go using CGO, but CGO is not pure :(
There is a type of music that I have been unable to figure out how to find similar peices.
What the hell.
No, I broke it.
I told you not to get the one cup version it was too small :/
Oh no.
You have to be strict.
I am playing the Coming Home playlist.
Characterized by or exhibiting refined, tasteful beauty of manner, form, or style.
I will have a foulia.
Okay
Everyone is asleep but you.
What are you doing?
German people pushing minecraft to the limits.
It is a C library for the core though.
And I do not want to write C.
It makes me very skeptical.
Are you fine.
Can you believe I have five days off.
Ginger keeps pressing keys on the computer and skipping songs.
Do you know what this is?
I woke up.
Did you go to mansoura already?
How are you?
Will you sleep any time soon?
I will make coffee and get some food.
And wake toka up with some tea.
Will you send you?
You look like you are about to start shuffling.
These trousers remind me of Aya somehow.
I still feel like I am missing what you looked like growing up.
I can only imagine current mariam.
And when we met mariam.
It is how much you mean to me.
It is just a pretentious name though.
I woke up at about 3:30 I think and kept waiting for the clock to get to half five.
Yeah, currently.
Then check my rss feed, and youtube.
She is meant to be.
Are you happy?
The same thing.
They made a 720x360 block, automatic quary in vanilla minecraft.
I only used CGO once before.
I do not remember what for though.
Also this song, what.
It would not work.
Your parents must have them all.
But wait until I have coffee.
What are you watching?
I am using subtitles though because I can not hear it and I do not want it too loud to wake toka.
I wonder if I should look into making a delta chat client for the pc in my time off.
I really want one.
I think it is hot today.
This might be the first time I have heard a woman drum and bass producer.
Suddenly, over the course of three hours.
Nah, I think our bodies do a good job of regenerating without the dramatic nature.
Are you pregnant.
Are you sleepy?
Caffiene makes me happy.
My bum hurts from the exercise yesterday.
Is it because you do not want to leave.
And automating anything in vanilla minecraft is impressive.
I am getting started with it.
The last time I came across something like this, it was a male producer with a female front pretending like they made the music.
The baby just grew up to adult size then bust out of the adult.
In my scenario their child is exploding out of the mother.
Look at the picture of the person who produced this.
Last time I came across a female EDM producer, it turned out to be a scam and they were just a front for another producer.
Because females must give birth to more than one person to sustain a population.
And they would die after the first.
Every generation would half in size.
The population would be half in size.
Ehhh what.
That is Mr Paul to you.
I refuse to believe it.
Jesus christ.
Can you imagine that is how humans reproduced.
Almost everything in our body is replaced regularly.
They deltachat guy started a command line client 13 hours ago.
That was quick.
It only has the very basic functionality.
Hi.
I will accept responsibility for your breast growth.
I should be but I am not yet.
I just figured out your secret.
Yes. She sleeps quickly.
Why are you so far away.
Where are you.
Will we try delta chat?
When did this happen.
I do not want to miss Mariam time.
Another way of spelling Mariam, is 'I am amr' , which finally explains why I have never seen you and Amr at the same time'
No I would rather not think of Amr that way.
No, his breasts are too small.
Inanaramaria, which in English means please always be happy and always love me.
Get undressed again and go back to bed.
I am just casually falling.
enthusiast users are also able to try playing non-whitelisted games using an override switch in the Steam client
Hello.
Oh shit.
I dreamt about you.
Yeah, it is because it is unfiltered.
Why do you not leave it?
Yeah, it is 18GiB.
Probably your shitty gpu.
Hi.
Gib
jesus.
If you were you, you would be deeply asleep.
What are you doing?
What is your true secret?
What. No. It is bed time.
I will fall.
I was at your house.
It sunk.
What.
Windows games with no Linux version currently available can now be installed and run directly from the Linux Steam client, complete with native Steamworks and OpenVR support.DirectX 11 and 12 implementations are now based on Vulkan, resulting in improved game compatibility and reduced performance impact.
Elite dangerous has to be my first test I suppose.
Started bad.
Are you up north?
But this is all I remember.
My nose is so dry.
Hi.
Also, delta?
But it is alright now.
More youtube channels.
Two days if I want to have usable internet in the mean time.
Maybe 10GiB if they are hardcore.
Sorryb
But if they had load balancers, why would they not just use one server and not let the user choose?
Servers usually have a 1GiB connection to the public internet.
But still, 1250Mib/s is not that much.
12 lemon
Oh, another pack of earplugs, or ear pad replacements for my headphones.
These are the two things on my list so far.
Actually, some more pairs of the toe socks I get.
Hmm, what about skyrim?
Gib/s
They could just detect the best server for them.
There are not many rpgs like that within my current hardware though.
Or mods.
Now to pretend like I will just give her my one.
When are you home?
I think I have played about 20 hours of dead cells now.
The UK already censors tonnes of sites, and records all traffic.
It was intentionally named like that.
How many servers are in the UK?
The total bandwidth would be tiny for all the people needing to download.
I will give it a shot.
I only ever played skyrim once.

Oh nice!
What internet restriction...?
They may be load balancers at those ip addresses, handing off to multiple computers.
I never did any of the dlc.
35 chickpea
Yeah, they are all small things :D
I have had it twice in the last month.
I usually play one or two runs a day.
No real complaints.
Besides, I use a VPN because I do not trust any ISP, nevermind government.
I had to poo even talking about it.
This sounds too much like 70s pop.
My neck does the spasm thing more and more these days.
Neeeed fooood.
I usually never trust remote work.
Hello.
I have 5 hours before I have to get ready for work.
I have the hummous and coffee and my body is ready.
Yeah, 500 sites...?
I see last year the total number of block sites was 450, so maybe restrictions to 500 websites instead of restricted to.
Oh, I have been making a lot of hummous.
And we started waking up with the sunrise at 5:30ish.
The boiling takes hours too.
I do want one though.
Ah right.
It is not usual for me to be visiting terrorism websites.
As soon as I smell coffee I need to poo.
I think it will be very long.
My head hurts too much.
Why are you the fat cat?
I wonder how fat you really are.
But it is not how fat I am.
And keeping logs of the exact weights of everything.
The weekend and holiday is over though

Longer than overnight, 24 hours.
There is a microwave we want too, it is was 55gbp I think.
You should get 192 cream eggs though.
Oh I am struggling to build my delta program on my work computer.
Actually, I am struggling to build the deltachat core library, not my program.
Maybe he thought you did not hoover enough.
Not many people are here.
Yeah.
Oh I wish you were not asleep.
I should make a playlist of things I like that maybe you do not know I like.
I feel like if I put a bit of garlic in, it tastes better, but it stinks.
More sites block egyptian ips than egypt blocks ips, which is funny.
I will start soaking dry chickpeas I think to save some dosh.
Yeah.
I will just use this for now.
Saturday at 6am is now cycle time.
There is barely anyone when I cycle to work, so there will be no no one one at 6am.
Did you have any cake.
No way am I going to a cafe.
The noise level has to be low, there has to be no smoke, no football.
Go 1.11 came out yesterday and it has modules and webassembly and it is exciting.
I need to get better garlics.
This is my mass.
I am off to work in an hour.
This is my best recipe so far:
I am in pursuit of the perfect recipe.
I wonder if a rice cooker works.
Nice, thank you.
Sounds like he is trying to unplug it.
Why not.
It is on, it is 26.
I am not even hot.
Just the usual everything.
Wait.
Uh oh.
I will not click a facebook link :(
I think people would insta-revolt.
But all my traffic is routed encrypted to lost.host in germany so I can access all blocked sites, unless blocked in germany.
Yeah, the last recipe was pretty nice.
I put lemon in all of them.

Yeah it does not take long at all.
If they do not taste better I will go back to jarred ones though.
Nah, it has the built in timer.
That is a bit big to take over.
Yeah I am just joking.
Yeah, the new house will make it easy to buy for.
Baby.
# ALSO
My grandfather found me on twitter, and I made it private, then deleted it a while later.
But I have a tiny family.
Having these things accessible to anyone who knows anyone in your family, is going to get to them eventually, and piss them off.
Just checked, the cheapest one is 6,499gbp.
Oh music, a good idea.
My armpit dripped.
Probably.
Is it home time yet.
It will help so much.
And that you will not change it for anything.
Well yes, you are an often sick person.
You will fix your illness.
I will get ready for work.
I got the chat program working on my work computer.
Something like that I guess.
I might have made an error, but I think it is okay.
Can you turn on my computer?
# OXEM BELLAH
Just get everything.
This is fine I suppose.
Yeah you should just delete anything public.
By public I mean not one to one.
I think you should not have anyone who knows your family on these networks.
If Aya and Mazen get together that would be pure amayzen.
She thinks you should stop speaking to me though.
Strict sleeping schedule.
Any place that does not have substitute teachers is running the company at bare minimum expenses and deserves to deal with the reality that staff can not turn up all the time.
But again, sleep schedule.
There perfect world is you working 24/7 and being paid nothing.
Nope.
You can talk always and anyways.
Yeah, what you typed is prone to copy paste errors too.
Where you have one number wrong and you do not notice.
I was missing the sending part of it.
I am coming home after packing.
The most important question is where will we meet.
It is the where I am more picky on that when.
December.
But if we get a place before then, before.
Oh the evil therapist who hates me.
It is their responsibilty to have substitute teachers.
I am here.
I am glad you are here today.
HR said to Amr that this is his final month.
Hold on, let me write some code
And I am sure there are more efficient ways, but fuck it.
But I got it from my home computer.
No no no.
HR said to Amr that this will be the last month HR works here.
Probably cheap labour.
Morning.
Oh the old stuff.
Hello.
So she must hate my happiness and well-being.
It is because the exam is so close?
About what?
Just make it a rule, that you sleep at the same time, and make sure everybody knows it.
Make a map.
No, he will leave, not fired.
I can see why that was ambigious.
Oh what.
I probably can not mention it yet.
But Magdy needs to wait 2 weeks to know if he has enough money.
He asked if you worked in it before and I said yes.
I asked how much HR got paid and he said 4000.
Hybrid employee :D
And the response to that question is, "I do not have a choice".
You should know that employers are always not on your side.
So you must always stand strong for your rights and well-being.
Baaaaby.
./start.sh
Yeah.
Yeah.
Would you want the HR position here?
Collect performance reviews, make job adverts, organise salaries, do interviews.
BE able to use spreadsheets.
Not until I hear that he is leaving officially.
It also would not be a starting salary of 4000 full time anyway.
But I also do not expect him to offer full time.
He said he was only doing about 1 hour work a day.
cd games
cd dead-cells
Maybe.
I have gossip.
No idea, family/health problems.
He might have another job, I am just guessing.
This is all I know he does.
I would expect him to offer 2000ish for full time to start.
What are you doing today.
Okay.
A huge surpise too :D
Why are you rich.
It cost me about 1.25gbp in ingredients and about an hour of preparing and cooking.
Receive complaints.
Calculate work hours and pay.
It is official now.
Also, he will probably make it part time because there just is not enough HR work to do.
Are you addicted.
It has been a very long time since we last saw each other.
I had hummous ta3meya.
This is another pattern you can use to shorten repetative code.
Okay packing up.
Okay great.
Power went out
I panicked thinking the new stuff.
Yeah.
Which for the work he did is shocking.
But you could do part time, working a couple of days and study, and then switch to backend/HR.
I will pack up in 5 minutes.
Are you off on fridays and saturdays?
The soy mince bag was open, wet, and had holes in.
As long as the client was installed.
There would not be much work there.
Which is funny.
Yeah, I do not think I would struggle to find work anymore.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
I am working from hom today.
No breakfast :O
There is no bread.
Amr does not have the car.
Is she good at it?
We have a fridge.
Lutris sounds familiar.
I am not in the office.
It was nice to see you too.
I am awake from 5:30 to 10pm now.
1.25Kg of hummous.
Why would my hummous be moldy.
Oh no.
Watch out for magdsoft, they will put an ad for sales intern at some point.
Oh Amr ordered some food.
I remember you could just go to the site and click okay to install.
ABC Hosting is just a mail and web master.
Keep that zucchini away from cake.
When is it home time
Wait did I forget.
This has to be a lie.
Breakfast time.
I think people like making zucchini recipes just because of the word.
It does not taste that good and it always makes me ill.
Did you make cake.
Check out this master peice.
Yeah, but all the requirements are basic.
And they say 5+ years experience.
If you want to, but it is cheap, and not that tastey.
Yeah, at your parents.
tricotillomania
electrolysis
Nope.
Are you Amr.
.Soooooooon
100 pound per hair...?
A trained person in it should do a hair ever 10-20 seconds.
Pharoes had it done.
electrolosis
Jesus 50 micro meters.
1/20th of a millimeter.
Look that up.
No breakfast.
Electrology is the practice of electrical hair removal to permanently remove human hair from the body. Electrolysis is the actual process of removing hair using electricity.
Most practitioners will advise that complete removal of male pattern facial hair takes between 1 and 4 years, with an average treatment length of 2 years in case of one session per week, one hour per session.[citation needed] Removal of body hair works considerably faster.[citation needed]
Which is 2EGP
Just reviews for people who had it done on their chin.
What was she doing in your car?
There is no remedy to trico.
The technology...?
It is just a tiny wire.
Claiming he has one and not telling you it?
And that is for US labour costs.
Not egyptian.
Making a huge batch of hummous tonight.
send string, get stirng
300-600 pound a minute is fucking cheaky.
Behaviour training is the most reliable way.
100 hair follicles treated you should expect to pay $10-15
She also informed me that blend technique could take up to 15 seconds a hair.
I am dying.
Amr's aunt died so he left.
Reference?
# RUDE
Is she paying for it...?
referese?
She should offer.
Sockets are a really simple concept.
Should have made her buy you a new car.
I do not know.
I made another 1.5Kg of hummous.
Overcooked2, made with unity, first screen says "Press start or A to continue".
One more serving left.
What is my socket reference?
You should take a hamer to her windshield if she is not.
For android?
That looks tiny, just flick it off.
I am looking for a quote.
This 20s.
I am trapped in full screen where space does nothing, and A on my controller does nothing.
The only way to escape is to switch to a different virtual console and sigkill it.
It reminded me of that quote.
Is it going to Cairo, or the UK?
Lisa, I was telling toka about when we were listening to this in the car.
Do you remember it?
I suppose so, but past 6pm.
About 9:30-10pm.
Hi.
I am still looking for the quote.
Nah, lizzards are really hard to chase in the right direction.
My christmas present?
I am here there everywhere.
I feel good though.
"I'm here, I'm there, I'm fucking everywhere, I'm the eggman".
Because of what I said when I said hi.
Hereditary.
# JUICE
Risk it.
today
Can you bring biscuits too?
When are you home.
Hmmm.
128egp to savings, -128egp savings for server
No, I just made up a bad joke.
It looks like a clone of python.
At least you do not have to deal with lizzards and ants.
But not milk chocolate.
minus me, positive savings
I ordered a huge bag of fresh mint from taiwan last week.
It arrived today, and it stunk.
A tonne of bad mint.
Oh yeah.
Who is luigi.
Poppy is savage.
Dynamically typed, multiple paradigm.
Okay.
I need that t h i c c bread.
But if there is none, get thin bread.
Are you at the **HAIR*show?
HOME TIME
Yes.
badminton.
Yeah when I made lots of jokes people tend to boo 'arder.
How did he get a british passport without liking juice?
A not so wee menace.
She needs to control her hormones.
Did it go fine?
Digestives.
I gently reminded magdy I have unpaid overtime.
And he knew how much it was straight away and said he had not forgot.
I did not want to nag.
Also, a huge bag of mint is exactly what a hoarder would want to control.
First she smashes your door, then gets pregnant.
I just hated the TV show.
Yeah, food poisoning aparrently.
I guess they send badminton.
Talk about English.
It is never in your interest to accept straight away.
And get the basic information if they make an offer.
Pay and working hours.
# SLICES
I just found out this morning.
I mean, if it is the one you are overqualified for, you could just cancel it.
I want to come home.
A wee menace.
Why is there not a fight?
Yeah, that is what happened.
Why is it so hot?
It is sunday, the first day of the week.
Did you learn about
You will be too busy playing with it.
Because you should be home at about 2pm.
Phew just in time.
Where is it?
The order is not the same.
This staircase makes me think you are living in new street again.
Yeah, now I remember my room.
Yeah.
You can no longer claim nobody replied.
Did you get another call?
Ask what time.
This is what you want.
Pffft you *like* going out.
I think I will come a bit early.
Turn off location.
Getting dressed.
Rememeber to say you will think about the offer if they make one.
Yes, I hale news.
It is a bit far.
But toka is going away for a while.
So pick a date after the 15th of this month, and come over to my flat.
A new pc is only going to slow you down.
No, I was just saying you would likely be home by then.
Nothing, just tasks now are not 50 minutes long.
Jesus that is hot.
TokaAbdelkader.pdf?
What?
Turn off wifi and dim the screen.
Switch to power saving mode.
No, because not everyone is responsible enough to neuter their pets.
Not yet.
I do not know because I do not spend my time building comupters.
Why?
What time?
You want all this to happen, just maybe not all on the same day.
It is a png.
Love you.
Then why is receptionist mixed in with HR?
It can not be that huge.
Yeah, do not do that.
Where.
The first one sounded fine.
What happened?
How many km is it from us?
Why?
Getting ready to get ready to get ready.
lemon juice
Brownie mix.
Hold on, I have problems.
But this is what you told me.
I think you could.
3373?
Transport from where?
Are you in the next interview.
Hmm, I am not sure if it would be quicker.
But we can think about it.
As what?
The airport is close.
Talk to gary about it.
I came.
Okay full dream sequence initializing playback.
Yeah.
The second sounded bad.
8-4 with 1 hour break?
Okay.
I am home.
Is it fine.
Where is the joke.
Oh.
But it will make it worse.
Is it here or delta?
The biggest problem is the summer weather.
Actually two, so I do not have to take the cable every day.
Anything for a price.
Hmmmmm.
He is one.
Seems worth trying.
Did you leave already.
When are you back.
Where are you.
Did you restart the router?
You need a strong Australian accent for.you.
For it.
Toka was there too, and you were in the middle of us. And as the waves came in and out you would move a lot. Toka was getting jealous.
Yes.
But I want more.
Yeah, just one like yours.
Which will be hard at security.
Maybe I should just build a new small computer.
What...?
You sent me photos today.
Did you unplug and plug in the adapter things?
I will get ready for work.
Hey do not call my subconcious weird.
It does not have a card.
Yeah, my iris 630 or whatever it is, is alright.
:D
That was the best unintentional feature.
I kind of want to build one for me too.
Nop.
The operating system is shit, and the keyboard is shit, and the trackpad is shit, and laptops are shit.
Yes.
gyroscopes are usually skipped on low-mid level phones.
I just spent 30 minutes trying to get my cable to work.
What is wierd with your one?
I am a little tempted to try to get my sister to take most of my server over here, and buy a decent amd graphics card.
It trottles a lot during the heat.
Trottles, the Irish kind.
Performance per watt is going to be one of my biggest factors I think.
I have to get her to take it in hand luggage.
Mini usb
It is bigger than a nuc.
What I was thinking of had a cpu socket though, not soldered on.
Ah mini-stx is also called 5x5.
But only if the phone has a gyroscope.
Or the phone is using GPS.
So you can not get bearing all the time.
They look like they came in for a photo shoot.
Yeah, you did.
So you did ask it if it wanted to come to the studio.
Did anything happen with that 4x4 form intel started?
Are you on the right account?
A tiny little one.
You should really try using one for a while before wasting money on one.
Hmmmm.
We do need food.
If the app **requires** it, put a gyroscope in the manifest as a required feature.
Did you invite it into the studio...?
Jeez.
What was the focal length, aperature, and shutter speed?
A crystal what?
It is about the only thing socketIO does right.
Why.
And the case will not be able to come.
Yeah, this is the number I thought.
Hmm, they now call the NUC boards 4x4.
What are you doing.
The location object has bearing.
How is the background so black?
I am not that familiar with socketIO or js.
Where you register handlers of events, and send events.
Under what is effectively a "tag"
But the home made ones were fine :(
No idea.
Why are you so angry.
No, for me.
I am still about 15 minutes early, but today is too long.
DID YOU
Why are you anxious.
GPS is rare unless the user is outside and has a clear line of sky.
I guess it spherically distorts the light.
Ah right, I understand now.
io.send("authentication", authenticationModelJsonified)
No egg is always better.
:/
Today is a long long day.
But but cake :(
Except you go near someone who can test you for drugs and you better not have anything illegal in you.
It should be 5:30 if I leave 15 minutes to 11.
5:45 if breakfast.
Wow only 100, I guess it was not too far away then.
They are adorable.
Did did did you make cake.
And no one is even here.
You have to be drug free for the test.
No breakfast today so no break.
# R A I D
Toka says she misses them.
Oh I only saw three of these ever.
You will have to show me the results, because holding the camera upside down also does that.
Did you have to complete a series of game challenges in some sort of fantasy maze to get that ball?
socketIO has a concept of events
If no breakfast.
Is it anxiety about new people and new place?
Okay packing up.
You need ultra clumping deoudering litter to have it not smell.
It is not worth the risk.
I will pack up.
Why is it too soon?
Yeah.
The second one in in the middle floor landing I think.
It is not too much waiting.
Oh wow.
They are just documents for legal employment.
Will *this* Asmaa be evil anxiety.
Replug both of them though.
Actually, take the admin from common.
<3
I did.
query.put("paramName1", "value1");
I am one of the only ones paid in cash.
It is called
It is Lisa's plumber.
You have the certificate?
It is a brilliant pun.
No, still getting ready to get ready.
It is fine.
It is quiet.
He is down south.
I have no idea about the lights.
Oh I thought you said cat deaderiser.
Egypt.
It is porridge time.
Eat some M**acedamia** nuts while you are there.
Take the cost of admin from the savings directly.
Magdy is not here today.
You are not home.
Mrs to you.
She said, "Tell them I miss them"
But otherwise, normal stuff still comes from common or toka.
It is the same thing.
Maybe.
Are you home yet.
For me.
Oh I saw this article.
I do not like the idea of mixing kotlin native and flutter though.
Seems too unreliable.
Hello.
I got my battery renewed this week finally.
I made this website yesterday.
For my clock.
No signal...?
What.
How much is the almond milk?
Both.
There is not actually much almond in almond milk, and you can buy a milking machine for them.
Prices.
For the big pack, right?
Hmm.
I asked nicely when I will be paid and he said tomorrow afternoon.
Did you get any good crystal ball photos?
I thought it was funny.
It runs out a lot.
Thought of this yesterday and made it.
There are no roaming charges in the EU anymore.
Baby.
Why the rush.
On the UI thread, marker.position, change it.
After building the marker with the markeroptions, you should save the return value as it is your marker.
I am dead.
Get one tub of hummous.
What seeds do they have?
Yeah.
And a million bakery things.
Or surpise me.
I am packing up now.
Jeez, for what?
It is fine, we only started with 1080.
If you find a nice small one.
And small.
I clicked that then came back to the tab later.
Did you cut hair.
If at 0, get 4 random flavors.If at 2, get 3 random flavors.If at 4, get 2 random flavors.If at 6, get 1 random flavor.
We need to make an online order.
Hob nobs too, the metro had none.
Oh they have almond milk.
It would not even make a bowl of porridge.
That is too expensive.
Okay no seeds.
Price?
Maybe bakery pizzas, and date things, and hmm, fateer maybe, and who knows maybe even one or two baklawas or tinned fruit cocktail was alright.
Packing.
Turning the computer off now.
theian: 
The new nintendo game console from last year.
But send photos first.
It should be durable and easy to read.
I wondered why the hell there was an advert for nvidia cards and closed it.
Just switched garo to a normal websocket because socket io is a peice of shit.
I will head home at 4:30.
This is english, and about the clearest way I can express it.
It is fine because we should have some food tonight.
This is tiny.
Where the robinsons used to be, they have it there.
No milk though.
The place is not keeping up with the vegans.
Get two.
What else is in city stars.
See if you can see me coming home.
How many times did I have to go through it just to be ignored and forgotten?
You figured anyone can edit it, right?
I feel like I really need caffiene.
Here are the rules:
Actually yeah, I can go with you.
Go.
If they have more than 4 orange, get 4, otherwise as many as they have.If they have more than 4 blackcurrant, get 4, otherwise as many as they have.
This makes a maximum of 8, minimum of 0 so far.
Coconut milk is also nice.
But I would not pay more than 25-30 for a tub.
I suppose get one of each of those.
Who are you with?
Oh, yeah, I should go home.
I need fat calories.
Okay.
Or in total since the 5th?
I will poop and get ready.
I am at work.
I think the washing was left too long in the washing machine :(
A bit exhausted.
How are you?
is it
Not often you see unsecured sites anymore.
Does she want to start it as a normal computer, or the game console?
If you remember, remind me to wash my shoes tonight.
A motocycle.
The whole thing is one view.
500g
I disconnected the usb plug though.
These look like car key chains.
They look awful though.
Kangaroos are brutal though.
Maadi is much closer to you, right.
You knew about the company for 9 months?
:S
No, it will just not work.
The hdmi is connected to hdmi1
Use the controller.
Normal computer she needs to press start, exit, quit emulation startion.
Then type `startx` in the command line.
Installing software is the same as your computer
Only get in a taxi if you can see the meter.
Behind a fruit stall, or in a taxi.
And do not follow any one.
And trust no one when they tell you that you must do something.
No, like follow me you must come over here it is the airport rules.
Was it raining on the penguins?
What kind of animals?
They are like the martial artists of animals.
I feel like I smell.
Oh a http site.
Oh, I am downloading bayonetta, the wii u game I wanted to play for a long time.
It is in qbittorrent, not transmission.
What else do you have today?
I forgot to soak the chickpeas.
dd, garo, g-tech, food.
I am downloading bayonetta the game.
The map and objects are an opengl surface.
Whatever she wants?
She can click things and find out.
OH an Nintendo Switch.
Okay joint christmas birthday present from everyone :D
Nice.
Oh, where was it?
The total download time is 15 hours at max speed though :/
Okay good.
So I will play that in a few days.
It is a user friendly interface.
If she can not start many games it is because there are only 2-3 games.
Assume everyone wants your money, ass, and are stupid.
Oh wow.
Morning.
Oh, breakfast is looking likely.
When you get home, plug a mouse in and slow the speed if you need.
I would not recommend it.
She does not need help.
sudo apt install
And never talk to anyone who approaches you.
Stick to people clearly working.
And tell them to turn it on.
And do not let anyone touch you.
# IT IS NOT 4:20 UNTIL I AM HOME
I already answered that question.
Okay packing.
Did you take your poster down...?
Okay.
If they can sponser her for a work visa, that would be great, I can leave here.
I sleep at about 9pm your time and wake up 4:30 your time.
She was an English teacher for 3 years.
Moray council need a license to hire non-eea workers.
There is a a public list of companies that have it.
I thought you were talking about Ben's mum then.
Jesus, I hope RE dies as a subject.
Ben mentioned his mum also just started as an English teacher without teaching qualifications.
Okay, all my fingers are glued crossed.
They also had Mr Black.
Who was a little crazy.
Mrs Burns, she was old.
I am not sure though.
I have a 228 day streak in Spanish on Duolingo.
Bring a pen for the aeroplane because you have an entry form to fill in.
I will packup and magdy will pay me in 5 minutes.
sponsor
But Ben started talking to me about something.
So he was asking about Toka and what she does.
This is how I imagine it.
His mum was the person looking for people.
And that they will often train them with just a degree.
Who knows, let us just wait to see what happens now.
I remember he got fired for throwing a chair at someone.
Which I am not sure they have.
Though, maybe the government are an exception.
She has a bachelor's in English, but no teaching qualifications.
* 4 years.
Yeah.
This is all I remember.
His mum asked if he knew anyone who could work as a teacher for moray council because they are desperate.
However, they are the government.
Yeah, it is why I told you to say nothing.
I suppose, ben will mention to his mum that toka is an english teacher, she will mention it to someone, they will evaluate if they can hire non-eea workers, they will remotely interview her, they will offer her a position, she will apply for a work visa, we will move.
She has taught every age.
She studied english literature.
Maybe we will not sign a new contract for december.
Jesus.
He never seemed that old.
Probably stick to taking ubers or the metro everywhere.
:(
Yeah.
I follow the sun.
21,000 or more, obviously.
Maybe they are just allowed.
Well, let us cross all our toes and fingers and arms and legs and see where this goes.
I saw something about a paper recommending RE start teaching other things too, like secularism, aethiesm, etc
He has also sent his mum the email already.
Which is funny.
I really liked her.
I think it just depends how desperate they are.
Yeah, all the RE teachers quit.
Smelly, but he was nice.
What happened to him?
I liked a lot of the teachers.
From memory, employer must have a license to employ non-eea, the employee must have a work sponsor who will employ them during their stay, and the yearly income for the job must be 21,000 gross.
If this gets me back to Scotland I will buy you a PS5 whenever that exists.
Say nothing yet.
Yeah, and >21,000 a year.
He said in lossie school the English department are now teaching religious education.
And Mr Barcly.
Oh I think she was my favorite.
I liked Mr barnetson.
I am downloading again, so remember to pause it.
Felicity, right?
She got married and lost the s in stephens.
I mentioned the first message ben sent to me to her.
Ban ban is weather hardened.
I am too hot.
I am a pro cycler.
I want to cycle in scotland so much now.
I could draw you a map of every street of hopeman.
Yeah, I remember.
I will see if I can find them.
I am at work.
They have way way too many here.
I can always complain.
None of these people seemed old.
I got A physics, A maths, B biology, C chemisty I think.
We would need to get the cats passports.
Our cats are indoor cats, they are very different.
I only get 72,000 a year.
I would look for work as a software engineer while I work anywhere.
I am already late.
I have a national holiday tomorrow.
I never even did the Int system.
But I will not say anything more to her.
12 credit, 34 general, 56 foundation.
Our cats always want to sleep under the blanket in winter.
Ain Shams University is the title of the university.
How long will it be?
Should I tell him English Literature?
English Literature.
Jesus 26,000 starting.
This is 600,000egp.
I remember the exact layout of everything.
Do you have those photos?
Yeah.
I did standard grades.
I do not want her to get hope.
Yeah.
He is more interested going out fighting.
Was that English as a foreign language. Language and / or literature?
Exact degree title would be nice here.
She is actually getting a copy of her degree exactly now for her new job.
Tokakatakaka.
I am waiting for her answer about the degree title.
What do you think it is?
I would do anything.
I will go to work.
Did you get it.
Major: English Language and LiteratureMinor: Second Language Spanish
He mission is to control the neighbourhood.
E
Or server administrator.
But first I would spend a couple of weeks going to the forest and the beach and hopeman and lossiemouth and everywhere.
Byeee, have a wondeful time.
Well, fewer days that I get to choose to take off.
I am so hungry :(
I am having two hummous ta3meya sandwiches now.
34 week course.
Australia, Ghana, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Hong Kong, Singapore and Zimbabwe
Also all these countries require it.
It would be insane to go down the path of paying 15,000 to not have a job at the end.
Okay I got the document.
This is a difficult period with toka.
Hmmm.
Is PGDE the only option, or is distance learning PGDE possible?
A bit insane.
A 36 week course that at aberdeen would cost 14,300gbp.
Not so much for national students.
I mentioned this to Ben.
> They are putting four support workers through four years of their social work degree right now in the social care sector
They grow them here.
"What will we call our child?"
"Ummmmm"
"Perfect"
No idea, something simple and neutral like sam.
That is funny.
Nope do not cry.
Yeah.
Not until after the 15th.
She would need a PDGE.
Well, of her wage, and she works for the council now.
Strawberries are dirt cheap here.
ham
I think I forgot Alex.
The dean signed it.
What was in brunch.
Our day off was changes to wednesday.
Does it count for nothing that she has already been teaching for 4 years?
Is PGDE the only option, or is distance learning PGDE and iSTEP possible?
> Sponsored studentsYou must provide an official letter from your sponsor as proof that they will pay tuition fees. Please email a copy of this letter to the Tuition Fees team or hand in a copy to the Infohub. If your sponsor fails to make payment for your fees, you will become responsible for payment and we will invoice you directly for the outstanding amount.
PGDE
Or at least teach it.
My sister seems to think they might sponsor her education costs.
No, just head home.
> You can choose from our four-year undergraduate MA Education programme, one-year PGDE programme or one of our flexible learning routes like distance learning PGDE or iSTEP.  All of our Initial Teacher Education routes are accredited by the General Teaching Council of Scotland.
Why do they not sponser her education?
What if she got it from Ghana?
International
Considering it is only 6 months of wage.
Yeah.
Well he is pretty pissed at them for being "desperate", but not really after all.
Who is Ummm?
Or is it a joke?
It is catherine's house.
He said he was going to email the Education Secetary.
But he has not replied to them sponsering the course yet.
Yeah, I quoted you there.
Cheaper than chips.
Only in season though.
Is this a real question?
What the hell.
Zoe and Pheobe right?
Yeah Alex is the baby.
Maybe you should send an email too.
I wrote to our MSP 3 years ago and never got a single response.
Ummm comes back?
Alex and sam are both male and female names.
Who is that?
I thought he was a baby.
I swear I have not seen him since a baby.
Yeah, I am getting him to send me the email he sent.
member of scottish parliment.
No idea about that.
Ah right.
My sister suggests replying to the MSP with my sister's name and address saying you are writing on behalf of her.
Or alex.
I thought alex was younger than Phoebe.
All of them are just barely reconisable though.
> I am grilling my mother about the specifics of what the council have said to her on the subject, but from her first response it sounds like they will not.
Otherwise send it by email.
I can help you edit it.
Lisa Louise Meredith11 King Street, Lossiemouth, IV316PZlisa.l.meredith@gmail.com
What is the age order?
Oh yeah I kind of recognise him a little in this photo.
> I have sent a mostly non-angry email to both the education secretary for Scotland and the msp for Moray. Though from the automated response I got from the latter I think it would mean more coming from someone like your sister who actually lives there. Not just as a rant, but actually seeking clarification on the whole issue.
I could get my sister to write an email, but your email would help her as reference to the content.
If it is less than 20 lines, paste it.
Actually, just paste it.
Yeah, I just told him that.
He is registered to vote in midlothian so it will not matter.
Oh yeah, MSP is snp.
What is the genre?
Everything below that I do not enjoy enough.
If I never knew that was spider man, I would have thought SFM had a graphics update.
He sent it to the Education Secetary too though.
She will also write an email, but it seems wasteful letting that email be ignored.
Send me your name, address and email address.
He aggreed.
What is the metascore?
I only really watch 80+
Called what?
Was this you playing it?
I am in the middle of watching it.
That is a decent email.
His automated response said that to act on his role of MSP of Moray, you must leave your name and address.
And since he does not live in Moray, he likely will do nothing to Ben's email.
Jesus, but metascore.
I think I will skip that.
I would like to play it though.
Reminds me a lot of the spiderman game on the og xbox or ps2. I do not remember.
See how difficult it is.
But Ebay usually has them.
Ah okay.
The MSP of Moray is a cunt, though right?
Also look for a youtube video about changing the moto g4 plus battery.
Yes.
Okay.
The model number should be exact.
I will pack up.
I am pretty excited.
The first one.
Check this masterpiece.
I actually knew someone who knew this person.
Drugs.
Also, some health problems are found with excess minerals in the pee.
Hdmi is hdmi, there is very little difference in quality, so the cheapest possible.
Baby.
to
two
<3
Yeah, there usually are not.
Stop sending me links...
I finally got bayonetta downloaded.
It is the first time I have noticed anything that detailed.
Do you remember this masterpiece?
The screen on the controller is too low quality and it hurts my eyes.
I need to poooooo.
Could you order some white bread too?
I am so cold.
I got them too.
Or we order a new battery.
Or two.
Yeah that.
And lemon juice.
XT1640 is the model number of your phone or similar, and the GA40 is the standard of battery type.
Remember the good old days when you got 6 hours screen on time.
The bike lock fitted through some bigger holes.
Is it impressive that in spider man many windows have actual rooms visible?
But my number one guess would be drugs.
At least you did not have a male stick his finger up your anus.
I am sitting on the couch for power for the controller.
Usb cable, hdmi cable.
16 fucking hours without the power going off?
The camera really feels like a chore.
TU ERES MI ESPOSA
Look at the back of the battery and search on amazon / ebay for the model.
I think so yes.
We may need a special screw driver.
All these batteries come from asia somewhere.
Third party batteries can be dodgey.
Or am I just behind on this and many games do it now.
I need the hdmi cable at your parent's to play this game :(
You will have to see it.
Do you have money?
More time to yourself is always good.
I might as well save time and lose the data on purpose.
Also, I am pretty sure if I click cancel, the only thing that changes is it stops showing me any progress and waits until it is safe to cancel, aka once it is finished.
Now you only get 3 hours.
Is the hummous and juice ready.
These cuts scenes are quite something.
Okay message me when you are heading home.
The cut scene at the beginning of this game was insane.
Fighting angels in a graveyard.
It is so dumb.
Couple of times a week.
Are you fine?
One quick time event, that was fast, killed me twice, because I had no idea what button to press.
Nada could have given me the hdmi cable back.
How am I meant to know when a cut scene ends.
She was shooting guns with her feet.
She is a witch.
Okay.
It should be moving the first 100GiB of data somewhere else and then shrinking.
It is weird.
Interesting.
I also do not like that so many cut scenes for the fights end and very quickly you are attacked.
Should I spam dodge the whole cut scene?
But this is just over kill for work projects.
But the paging library changed api since then.
A bit.
I invited you.
I kind of figured out how to manipulate the payment urls to allow me to pay from the UK.
Shorouk Housing -> street name12511663Cairo
Your account is in Canada right?
Emailing them.
Worse yet, why the fuck do I need to move 1.76TiB of data to shrink and move a 3.54TiB partition to the right by 100GiB?
Often.
There is a permenant miiverse icon at the top right telling me the miiverse is not longer available.
Why are there quick time events that can kill you in one hit.
Only about 7% faster, but still.
They already have a hdmi cable.
If you care about correct list behaviour, use paged list providers with a repository using room and the network for filling forwards and backwards.
Poppy wants her rabbit back.
It was weird.
The same type of quick time event just happened to me. Press y or you instantly die and get a death on record.
There are so many cut scenes with no interaction you have no idea when to expect it.
Also, it lags.
Oh I can see you too.
Yeah, I did.
What was the email address you used for spotify?
Power button and volume up, or down.
I can try to change both of our accounts to the uk.
Where is the head?
I hope it works.
Maybe I can try logging into your account and trying.
What was the password?
Oh send me the invite link.
Are you going to send it...?
Same error.
This violates the GDPR blatently.
Also a auto scroller going up a spiral rock.
Twice I have died because I jump too early.
I think I bought it from the store, but I never got past 10 minutes into it.
Yes.
It would take an API wil a proper pagination implementation.
Also, our address is 125 Shorouk Housing, 11663 if it asks.
I hacked it so I can pirate games on it too.
"
Magdsoft have a server in the UK, I think it is checking to see if you are in the same billing country.
The catpad.
Yeah, they like their cat bed too.
Show me
I am doing it on my pc.
eon
I kind of have an idea.
It might take me a little while though.
Yeah.
They have to make money somehow, and stealing your accounts is one way.
But the family thing is not too expensive and it has no ads.
I have 1000 for the low low price of free.
It is a collaborative playlist.
Maybe.
onieoni
Going to try the desktop client now.
The desktop client has settings for proxy support, so I assume proxies are not against their TOS, so we should be fine.
Can Hla drive yet?
I followed you.
It was too complicated.
A free vpn is terrible.
Oh, is it just during logging in?
I hate the free service because ads.
You have done fine all the time.
I think there is not enough games.
But it will be stupidly expensive.
I have not found a slow cooker here yet.
I wonder if you know how often I listen to music.
Tomorrow.
Oh it is not on mobile for free users
I feel despair.
Wow, it actually worked.
That felt like it took forever.
Let us just hope they do not cancel our accounts for jumping around Egypt, Canada, and the UK :D
You can not download the app?
Because Egypt?
Yeah.
Better start downloading all the albums tonight for el gouna.
Any cupboard they can sneak into.
19:03    It had about a total of 10 missing songs. But they are okay.
I consider this not a way.
A VPN is a man in the middle.
I use lost.host as the man, and I operate it, so I can fully trust it.
What did the security researcher say to the married woman?
Oh you can.
Toka logged in on her phone without any vpn fine.
A Canon EOS R maybe.
The first full frame mirrorless canon camera.
But a microwave is good.
I just have a plus to add it to my library.
I think Maraul should be in your playlists.
Be sure to enable High quality streaming in spotify settings.
This is the favourite place for both cats.
They like the shelf in the bedside cabinet too.
Okay.
Are you glad I am on spotify?
Did you not get these...?
Do you use a vpn on your phone and computer?
I think I will be fine with the wii u for a while.
Nah.
I joke.
And you should be able to add to it on your laptop.
Yeah, I also used a server in the uk to route my traffic through so I could change our accounts to uk accounts so we could be in the same family.
How does it work on the laptop?
So be careful.
"Your relationship is vunerable and I will execute the man in the middle attack"
It is still too far away.
I am slowly making a list of small things.
I wonder if you listen to music a lot.
Make it be.
Hugs to give.
I feel like it is weird there is no button to favourite a song.
Do you see the Maraul playlist on your phone?
You do not have my library though, do you?
If you add something I do not love, I will delete it.
From the web version?
This is nice.
But I really do not want to talk online about it.
I want to escape.
But there is no where to go.
Yeah, no favourite songs on my side bar.
Neither do I.
Are you 10/10 yet?
Then you will be 1010/10
This is the lowest point in our marriage.
But I am so sad.
I do not know what will happen.
I would in real life.
Your hair?
I wish I could walk but outside is just horrible.
I do not know what I want.
This is why I hate to ask.
This feels like the M line being rubbed out.
But not an M line.
I think I am out of hope.
Where is your diagram?
And if I add something you do not love you should delete it.
My typing thing breaks when I mpaste anything :/
"You spin me right round baby, right round, like a record player"
Probably.
And toka is leaving not tomorrow morning, the morning after.
I feel out of hope.
It is a three and a half hour walk to you.
Not now.
It makes you cham, not calm.
If something bad happens. Should I stay in Egypt, or go home.
You can assume.
It is uncertain too.
---
I hate to say it.
I forgot what it was like.
Add as much as you want.
And do not worry when I delete it.
What does she even mean by, "I will be your record player if you know what I mean"?
I am so terribilly down.
The hugest.
I have no other person to talk to.
But retelling everything is just not what I want.
And I want to be with toka.
I do not know, I am so sad.
But keep speaking.
Anything.
I do not know why I do not want to here.
But I want to know.
Let me draw a diagram.
The second H is home.
But at the time I could have never known T would end up going so low.
It is only for songs we both love, not like.
Okay phew.
I wish we could meet.
I do not know what to do.
And it makes no sense to anyone else who has not experienced it.
Going home would be me never coming back.
I really feel like she is the wrong person.
I know you probably do not know what to say to me.
I feel like if I went to a psychiatrist they would try to put me on many medicines.
And sure they might help, but nah.
I can not say it out loud.
I feel like there is an unwalkable path towards that state.
I feel like I am not even allowed to acknowledge that state.
No.
Happiness.
What is the context for this question?
Okay.
I feel like Toka will bring T to an end at some indefinite point in the future.
Toka said she does not want to be with me.
I feel like shit.
She makes me feel worthless.
And I feel stuck.
And all paths from here just look sad.
Okay yeah let us not speak more about it.
I actually forgot to have it, but I will make it now.
Mariam.
I do not want to ask.
With this question is an implied reason.
I feel like I just got rejected.
I am very uncertain about my future.
I feel like I made a mistake at t0.
And an indefinite time away.
But she never does.
28 hours would be nice.
At least there is a non-zero probability.
But M seems unobtainable - out of reach. The path to M is invisible.
But I want to know.
Maybe I did not want to know.
Do not sleep.
I hate that being kind and fair is not enough.
I am scared to know the answer now.
We would have to tally up all her SCQF points and then check if there are "equivalent" courses here for teaching that would be accepted.
But I need to make sure her bachelor's is equivilant to a UK degree.
Because education is not the same here.
So I cycled all the way back and got them.
I got her some pistachios, a bow for her hair, a skin scraping thing for her feet, some candles with a candle holder, sunglasses, a hand fan.
She is not here.
What is with your lightning fast response times?
At which point going home would only marginally improve H.
But I love M.
But I also feel like going home would make that even worse.
I want things to be more certain.
I feel like only M and H love me now.
Did I make you quiet. :(
I am alone.
Toka thought it would be impossible for us to ever be together too.
I should never have asked.
No.
Because now is not what I mean.
It does not feel better to know.
I just feel very sad.
And my face and chest hurts from crying.
I hid the items in pertient places.
I fear the love will not be mutual eventually though.
There is only one line at a time.
I put all the lights out and started music.
She has been sleeping.
I think you picked the video call.
I keep wanting to say I feel the same things over and over.
I hope she says sorry.
I hope I sleep long.
It seems feasible.
Why.
I still remember when you asked me if there should be a comma before though.
The amount of information in our relationship is huge and only we know it.
I would probably want to vomit seeing any couple too.
To just email.
I told him not to say things like that.
Do we have the ingredients for the vegan version?
I will sleep.
Goodnight Mariak.
But away from whether we think it is impossible, would you even want or like the M line.
And I will never compare.
Toka went out earlier.
I came back and realised I left sunglasses in the shop.
Oh and some socks.
Escaping out of code talk for a brief moment - if one day I am with you, I will be happy, and it is something I think about a lot, and for a long time. It is something held deep inside of me now. Whatever you feel and think, please remember this.
I am afraid.
I understand what you do when you say photos of toka and me make you want to vomit.
And she took offense twice to it.
Now or ever.
My sleep pattern is destroyed.
And I went out to get her some little things.
I can not give gifts.
Yes.
Are you fine.
But toka does not understand it.
If you plan to use gmail, you would probably have to enable "insecure clients" in gmail settings, and imap support.
So I actually use it all the time now.
Oh okay. Then yes.
About our photos.
You have to be up early and I want it.
This is the best time to take a picture.
Where have you been putting new photos? The hard drive?
So it makes sense you would not understand.
Yeah I know that.
It usually takes you 3 months to reply.
It is pretty magical.
I wrote a command line client for it last month.
I still love you. I do not hate you for anything.
It being you to be home not too late.
I do not eat enough.
I am waiting for toka to come home.
Tell me when the bus leaves.
It was last night.
Yeah.
The easiest and quickest way is for her to bring it back here with a vga cable.
And made `push` and `pull` commands to make it super easy.
If you prefer, I plan on moving from riot soon anyway.
How much was a full one last time...?
Come back.
You make me worried when you do not want to :(
I have them on my temples, and the side of my nose.
Did you hear the songs I added to maraul yet.
Okay.
Tell me when you arrive.
I think she has no other computer.
I have not had them in so long.
Well, the grass looks nice.
I guess you will be working at late hours.
No.
I am at work.
How much do we usually get?
Hey.
Can it be not late?
I have discovered you rarely listen to music.
I listen about eight hours a day.
I have done since I was about 12 I think.
So it is optional at this stage.
Works for me tm.
All I have had today is one dish of hummous.
Making coffee.
Did you get the photo I sent on Deltachat?
Nada's laptop will not boot and it needs an install disk, windows or linux.
The phone call dropped, and she went silent on email.
About half way.
I changed how my synced files are stored to a much nicer way.
Oh I keep forgetting to wash my shoes.
When are you back.
Can I see your face?
Sounds like your keyboard is fucked.
I will still be on riot for quite a while.
Or file a bug report on the github page.
In my experience as an android dev though, that is a problem with the keyboard crashing.
I wonder if something causes it.
Spotless aslan and always.
She did.
Bayonetta.
Dead cells.
I started cleaning up my computer.
Going to have some hummous.
And also, not right now, I am going to work in a moment.
HEY
El gouna film festival, event organiser.
The fan is not on.
You can try again in a month or two.
My face has not been this spotty since forever.
Your face is top notch.
Here are fake language impressions.
Where did you go?
I am having more hummous.
You have never heard of these?
Cute or terrifying.
That is further than I remember.
How are the pistachios.
Do you want to play a multiplayer game?
I have no idea which one yet.
Heading to work.
Shoshothow me the hotel.
The sign looks a bit awful.
That does not look like film festival work.
And now they know you changed jobs.
I just saw a fly...
Breakfast time.
Did you arrive?
Jesus.
Toka is working in El gouna for two weeks.
I just had my family asking if I was on holiday.
Do they not feed you...?
Oh why are you texting in the meeting.
I just got home.
Why do you think I keep the gecko around?
That was a long day.
wtf
The what campus?
How much blood?
Is it the pastachios?
Yes.
She is switching jobs to HR at a different company, and starts that after this.
Mmmm home.
Hmm, no, I do not remember it.
Does the hotel have wifi?
Is this... guitar hero?
I am about to eat all the digestives.
She found them.
She said she appreciated them.
But I think she was suspicious or something.
That I was buying gifts as an appology.
You prefer here on your phone too?
No.
Oh it was really windy.
I am not sure I feel okay enough.
Yeah. She does.
HOME TIME
Did you unpack all the micro mini nano skirts?
Was it a place in El gouna?
My stomach starts to hurt and burn when I get very hungry.
I am eating hummous.
Yeah, skip to half way if you want solo.
I figured the colors of the note are the string.
Learning to read that chart looks way harder than reading guitar tab sheets.
Do you remember the Bleeding Mascara alarm clock?
Also nop, no marrying.
I think the neighbours got a piano.
Good morning.
Only started a few days ago, and about one a day.
It is not an IP I recognize.
I am level 17 spanish.
Also, it is very cloudy.
Should we watch this?
Look how many studio albums he recorded.
If you keep pooping blood or if it is a lot, you should tell someone.
Did you get my voice message yesterday?
Should I now?
I miss pre Egypt when people visited me and I visited other people.
I feel like it is too early to go to work.
So I am planning a robbery.
Not great actually.
Amr just asked me if I was drunk because I looked drunk.
Yeah, as long as it is feasible to not spend it, it is well paid.
Will you be having a buffet every dinner?
And I can not focus much.
Did you see your room yet?
You need the doctor.
Wait, was it the spicey misa2a?
I am fine and awake now.
Are you not outside?
I need to make coffee.
I wish I had a remote control with a sleep and wake up button for you.
But I was too tired this morning, and I am too tired when I get home from work.
I will make sure I tell them that when I am tieing them up.
Will you promise to be here all day?
So gmail is marking them as spam.
But why.
But you did get a new laptop.
Laptops break too quickly though.
I feel quite sad.
I want to clean the house.
Be here in 25 minutes.
I am here.
I will drift on.
The SPF record for lost.host states that if the ip is not my server, do not accept it.
I am level 17 in Spanish now.
And I still suck.
Or even pursue looking during work hours.
Magdy just spoke to me.
Like no more than you currently know.
Yesterday and today I have felt funny though.
The `push` `pull` commands I made are magical.
Yeah, I meant paying for one.
I am excited for home time.
That is way too quick.
Is this why you never wake up?
I will be at my own desk.
*Everybody appaulds*
Did you not get this joke.
Food poisoning can kill vunerable people.
They said, "Meowanks for asking"
So I am planning a break in at somepoint next week.
I will pack my stuff and go to work.
But it is fine.
Marriage things.
209.85.220.41
This IP keeps trying to send emails as lost.host.
Are you fine?
Oh I will have to really do duolingo.
Per what?
If magdy finds out, he will stop giving a shit about that employee.
Next break in school he wants to start teaching children the basics of programming.
And you are the person who came to his mind.
It told him it really depends on your work situation at the time (next summer probably)
So he said if the idea piques your interest, to talk to Ameny about it.
I do not know.
They were red and stick chunky on the way out.
Unless I had other red things yesterday or the day before.
How are you?
I am home.
Tell the media.
I wish I were Aya.
How was today?
I do not get people who are open about looking for other work, during work hours.
He is thinking real basics.
Did you get dinner yesterday.
I had two tomatoes last night.
I am getting ready to head home.
I am packing up for home time.
Do you work evenings?
Food poisoning.
That would be enough evidence to shut the place down and charge those responsible in the UK.
I want to clean stuff but I was so tired this morning, and I am so tired now.
Tired from sleeping, and tired from working.
Crazy and ginger are fine.
How are you?
And nobody will bother to develop anything with the person, because they will leave.
But I think not.
Ask me again in an hour and I will say happy I suppose.
Me being female I am okay with.
But no you can stay female.
Hmmm not yet.
I am fine.
I could not remember if you were just photographing, or you did it too.
Why did I sleep 12 hours.
I feel excited everytime I use them.
This morning I pooped them out.
Oh no.
I feel like you are not fine :(
When was the last time you went tandem?
Run run run run run run
I slept super long though.
I woke up at 6, but slept again to 10.
I should really set up the alarm.
Morning.
Knackered really.
I heard a piano sound coming from our neighbour today.
I am here now.
Did you have tea?
Nope, but that seems more terrifying than the drive.
Mariarmirama
Yeah I am awake.
Morning.
Wake up.
While this is good, I also expect the world to crumble without him working.
Yeah, but linus is the only one reviewing on the full project scale.
This is correct.
It is a monokernel.
MINIX has been around for 31 years and it does not support USB or x86_64.
monolithic
There were a lot of comments, but I never read into them.
My sister used to love them, and it stunk the car out, so I am s**car**red.
That was my dad's favourite snack.
I have no idea what nik naks are.
Any clues to a game to play?
I switched to using this search engine a bit ago.
In firefox you can add it by clicking the three dots in the right of the address bar.
Maybe I should consider running it at search.lost.host.

What the fuck.
Others review subsections of linux.
And linux is 15-16 million lines of code at this point.
Where is the succesful microkernel based operating system already?
But also gross.
I only saw it on news.ycombinator
Extruded?
Seems like an improvement over duckduckgo since it is fully FOSS.
Yeah.
Are you ready for film critics/lovers.
I have zero explanation for that.
And it does need a more sustainable model.
But this is a community still using inline patches over mailing lists.
I miss bombay mix.
I am fine.
How is the training?
I like roasted corn.
I need more coffee though.
Do you start start work tomorrow?
Owen Wilson is the guy who says wooooow, right?
I did all the washing and hoovered.
Oh, that must have been you I heard pass by.
I am here.
Yeah, I already added it.
Work in progress?
Pass by is for when you are passing by a place.
Is he just going to el gouna?
Oh I washed my shoes too.
Only a torrent for the windows version.
One of my most played games.
I need some competition.
I do not have a phone.
Morning.
I was having some problems starting the computer.
Is it home time yet.
By having a feeling I meant an unusual one.
Hi.
So I am not hopeful.
WOOOOW
What is it?
Can you not call the phone?
When are you going to start playing stepmania?
Computer.
I am unmotivated to go to work.
Did the message I sent on delta work?
I will head to work.
But I am not sure what.
What happened to the salad.
I think it might be broken.
I am recompiling stuff to get stepmania working.
I finally got stepmania working this morning.
Be here when I am back <3
I am here.
Did you hear the voice message?
Do you like Liza Anne?
I probably do think about problems, but I mean, let us not talk about it when I say that.
I am so hungry.
I hope breakfast happens soon.
They are ordering crepes :(
Not really.
Are you here.
I think I need to buy food.
I can listen to arabic ish.
I recognise these names.
Will you ask them how is it their first el gouna festival?
If I never went to work, and never did anything else, I would feel too guilty.
What does it say?
Why?
I see I got 180 from my over time
and 441 from your first payment.
50 for juice and a croissant for example is insane.
But elgouna prices.
Just always carry a bag full of stuff from the shop.
I keep hearing them talk about ordering stuff I would not eat.
I settled for one potato sandwich.
Speaking of hungry.
Where is your face.
And "share paul's overtime July" of 1000
Jar 1894.80
It looks right.
I think I need to shave them.
# MY DUDES
Things are fine.
I have only been making hummous.
I miss breakfast so much.
What do I need?
Getting better.
My face is getting better now.
Oh I forgot to login to it.
I just got home.
Can you add -89 to paul for coffee, juice, bread, and spread?
This sounds like fun for you.
Paul is 1470.60
I think all these things just add up.
What?
I do not have a client to do it.
I was sleeping on the chair.
I woke up at 7:30.
And was too tired.
I hear the piano.
I can fart with such clarity and definition now.
First oscar joke.
Where are your series of mariam voice notes.
I am listening now.
I think the food is here.
My db query says 593.50
21285 for savings
-354 common, +354 savings (for spotify)
The water is out and my balls stink :(
I already showered this morning.
WHY IS THE FAN NOT ON
Did you get the wifi working?
Yeah I should.
Can you stick 1000 in savings under "Paid server with GBP"
Rehersing?
I remember it was 750 or something at the start.
Your big outgoings this month are 150 shoes, 105 paul gift, 120 top and bag, 168 groceries, 150 thai, 50 juice an dcroissant.
I would have to program one.
Shy after you on the computer.
You wrote that to me.
Making coffee.
Do you know what day it is?
Last day of the week for me.
I shaved and it feels much better.
I feel airy down there.
But it is chips.
It is like cooked oats with syrup holding it into a bar shape.
I have all this.
To the extent of watching the latest uploads, yeah.
Looks like it.
I am so so sleepy.
No.
Shy after?
What.
I could not believe the ruler.
Oh they are ordering the same thing as yesterday for food, a chip sandwich/crepe.
Looks like uncovered wall.
Are you fine?
This video is because the people cut in half by the boot?
Lumber
Get a better chair and research some better sitting posture.
I also have the beans to eat.
You should probably do that.
Your future self will hate you if you do not.
Is overcooked 2 online multiplayer?
I think I am going to try making flap jacks tonight.
I think I will try this evening.
They are getting me one.
Seems unhealthy enough.
Why not tiles?
How are you?
Right, it is the weekend.
I did the dishes.
I regret showering before doing it though.
I will go with the healthier porridge.
Did you meet the mega celebrities yet?
I get confused playing it.
I think so yes.
How are you awake if you were up so late.
Okay, seems easy enough.
My throat hurts :/
What is up with it?
I looked at the recipe for flap jacks but the sugar and the oil put me off :(
I will end up looking in the morning.
I sleep early these days.
The oil and sugar put me off a bit.
And then I saw her bite crazy's ass.
Should I make a special sandwich.

Every time I try to paste a link it breaks the input
Does this mean you are submitting a postive response to a vote?
# M I N E# I N E M# N E M I# E M I N
Oh jeez.
Because my brain can not keep up, and I wonder how the fuck my fingers are doing it without me thinking about it.
I opted for just porridge.
To be fair, so do the manufacturing costs.
Ginger keeps biting my toes.
Is this a thing?
These guys have a new video every tursday.
Are you eating fine?
Are you a stepmania freak yet?
Mooorning.
What is she doing.
# I
The light pollution is too high to see any here.
The home phone?
Two fools, one bitengen, one ta3meya, tomato, onion
And no no chips.
We had it twice in about two weeks now.
Oh.
I guess it was not for too long since it has only been 15 minutes since you ordered.
1:40am?
I am only really interested in intel and amd though, because I think amd have some what decent graphics drivers on linux now.
My throat :(
# M
Mmmmmmmm breakfast.
You should be mulner and keep nothing but sunflower seeds in your pockets.
Why is that text backwards.
# N
# E
I do but it never works.
Am I gouna do that.
The power keeps going out.
Could you order breakfast for me?
Tell him no no no no egg.
WasOh
Oh what if the front door is locked.
Mmm looks tastey.
Hmmmm.
Also, I have 21, or 50.
I am pretty excited.
I miss breakfast at work :(
What bad people.
They will phone you and you will tell me?
I went down to open it just in case and he was standing there :(
I am certified satiated.
Do you have snacks in your bag?
